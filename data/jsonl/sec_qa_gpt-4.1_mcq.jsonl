The attacker also makes an actual HTTPS connection to the service and proxies\n\ndata for the victim. All of the victims data will show up in plaintext for the attacker but the connection will appear\n\nto be secure for the victim. This is used in the [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler){.link} debugging proxy to\n\ndecrypt HTTPS traffic and is also used in some network appliances that perform deep packet inspection.\n\nAnother MitM attack on SSL is simply to maintain or downgrade to an HTTP connection with the victim and proxy data to an\n\nactual HTTPS connection with the server. Most servers will upgrade an insecure connection, but by intercepting that\n\nexchange the attacker can continue to monitor the victim's traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::::::::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"5.2.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

Protocols\"}\n\n\n# 4. Protocols {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__protocols}\nProtocols can be though of as rules that dictate communication. A protocol may include information about the syntax\n\nused, error correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication occurs in the context of that\n\nsituation. In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses\n\noften determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed\n\nvia individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for\n\nComments (RFCs). You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. [Some of the earliest web\n\nprotocols are detailed in RFCs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616){.link} More often than not, large\n\nprotocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the [Institute of Electrical and\n\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/){.link} which handles WiFi protocols. These groups publish papers\n\ndetailing how the protocols work.\n\nThis chapter will give a brief description of important protocols following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important\n\nto note that some of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks. In this case they will be grouped\n\naccording to which layer they largely function within.\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"4.1.

During the recon\n\nphase, a malicious actor will gather as much information as possible. Methods used in this phase may be passive or\n\nactive.\n\nPassive recon involves gathering information *without* sending anything to the target. This typically involves accessing\n\npublicly available information, such as social media, published websites, and DNS records. If the actor has access they\n\nmay also passively sniff network packets.\n\nActive recon involves interaction with the target.

These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host\n\nto have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and typically support a commonly used\n\nservice. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them. Lastly ports 49152 to 65535\n\nare used dynamically by applications as needed.\n\nIt is important to know some commonly used ports as the services running on these ports may be subject to an

In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings.

These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses\n\noften determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed\n\nvia individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for\n\nComments (RFCs). You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. [Some of the earliest web\n\nprotocols are detailed in RFCs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616){.link} More often than not, large\n\nprotocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the [Institute of Electrical and\n\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/){.link} which handles WiFi protocols. These groups publish papers\n\ndetailing how the protocols work.\n\nThis chapter will give a brief description of important protocols following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important\n\nto note that some of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks.

ARP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__arp}\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used on the local ethernet segment to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. Since\n\nthis protocol functions at the ethernet segment level, security was not a primary concern. Unfortunately this means that\n\nARP communications can be easily spoofed to cause a MitM scenario.

Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) reaches across layers to work\n\nwith the DHCP lease database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a DHCP lease was granted.\n\nWhile this can solve many of the issues associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure higher-level\n\nprotocols such as HTTPS just in case.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.1.2.

These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

MAC Spoofing/MAC Cloning {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_spoofingmac_cloning}\nMost networks expect that a MAC address will correspond to the unique numbers on a network interface controller (NIC),\n\nbut it is actually quite easy to change. Virtual networking necessitates the ability to use a different MAC address and\n\nthis feature is built into most modern operating systems. MAC spoofing is when an attacker sets their MAC address to the\n\nMAC address of another machine on the network in an effort to initiate an attack. For example, them may set themselves\n\nup as a gateway to launch a MitM attack.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.2.2. MAC Flooding\"}\n\n\n### 5.2.2. MAC Flooding {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_flooding}\nSwitches are tasked with keeping track of which MAC addresses correspond to which ports on the switch. They use this to\n\nmake sure that traffic is only routed where it needs to go. Given that MAC addresses can be changed, an attacker could\n\nflood a switch with packets from many different MAC addresses and possibly overflow the MAC-port routing table. Some\n\nswitches may default to hub-like functionality and send frames to all ports in an effort to keep traffic flowing. This\n\nthen allows an attacker to capture traffic from other machines on the network.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.2.3.

Container Orchestration Systems {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__container_orchestration_systems}\nContainers also make it easier to restart or scale applications. Container orchestration systems leverage this by\n\nmonitoring containers and bringing them up or down as needed. The most popular container orchestration system is\n\n[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){.link}, developed by Google to manage web applications.\n\nGiven the orchestration systems create containers from images as needed, one of the obvious areas of concern is the\n\nintegrity of those images. If an image registry is compromised the orchestration system will still deploy the images\n\nstored there typically making the issue far worse. Containers can also be hard to manage from a logging standpoint,\n\nwhich may cause compliance issues.

ARP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__arp}\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used on the local ethernet segment to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. Since\n\nthis protocol functions at the ethernet segment level, security was not a primary concern. Unfortunately this means that\n\nARP communications can be easily spoofed to cause a MitM scenario. A malicious actor simply sends out several ARP\n\npackets, *gratuitous arp*, saying that traffic for a certain IP address should be sent to them. Since the MAC to IP\n\naddress table is cached in several places, it can take a long time for all the caches to invalidate and resolve an issue\n\ncaused by malicious ARP frames.\n\nThere is a protocol designed to mitigate the issues with ARP. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) reaches across layers to work\n\nwith the DHCP lease database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a DHCP lease was granted.\n\nWhile this can solve many of the issues associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure higher-level\n\nprotocols such as HTTPS just in case.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.1.2.

Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host\n\nto have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and typically support a commonly used\n\nservice. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them.

ARP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__arp}\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used on the local ethernet segment to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. Since\n\nthis protocol functions at the ethernet segment level, security was not a primary concern. Unfortunately this means that\n\nARP communications can be easily spoofed to cause a MitM scenario. A malicious actor simply sends out several ARP\n\npackets, *gratuitous arp*, saying that traffic for a certain IP address should be sent to them. Since the MAC to IP\n\naddress table is cached in several places, it can take a long time for all the caches to invalidate and resolve an issue\n\ncaused by malicious ARP frames.\n\nThere is a protocol designed to mitigate the issues with ARP. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) reaches across layers to work\n\nwith the DHCP lease database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a DHCP lease was granted.\n\nWhile this can solve many of the issues associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure higher-level\n\nprotocols such as HTTPS just in case.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.1.2.

The other options either mischaracterize the challenge (B, C) or inaccurately describe the educational value (D).", "question_token_count": 39, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 6, "avg_answer_token_count": 21}
