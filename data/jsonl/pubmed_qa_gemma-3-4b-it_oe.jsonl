{"context": "This study was undertaken to examine whether use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and other illicit drugs is related to the likelihood of sexual behaviors that increase risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among youth.\n\nThe 1990 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey was used to collect self-reported information about a broad range of health risk behaviors from a representative sample of 11,631 high school students in the United States.\n\nStudents who reported no substance use were least likely to report having had sexual intercourse, having had four or more sex partners, and not having used a condom at last sexual intercourse. Adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, odds ratios for each of these sexual risk behaviors were greatest among students who had used marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit drugs. Students who had used only alcohol or cigarettes had smaller but still significant increases in the likelihood of having had sexual intercourse and of having had four or more sex partners.\n\n", "topic": "Adjusted odds ratios revealed that marijuana, cocaine, and other illicit drugs were significantly associated with increased likelihoods of sexual intercourse and multiple sexual partners among high school students.", "question": "Considering the adjusted odds ratios presented, what specific methodological approach was employed to mitigate potential confounding variables in assessing the relationship between substance use and sexual risk behaviors?", "answer": "Adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.", "explanation": "The context explicitly states that the study \"adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity,\" indicating the use of regression analysis to control for these factors and isolate the effect of substance use.", "question_token_count": 31, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 12, "choices": null}
