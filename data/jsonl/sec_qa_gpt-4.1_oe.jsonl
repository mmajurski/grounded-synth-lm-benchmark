{"context": "## 6.1. False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine. The result was a\n\nmachine that was unusable.\n\nFor 13 minutes, Webroot distributed this rule to its antivirus software shutting down operations on an untold number of\n\nmachines. Fortunately Webroot was able to quickly identify the problem and send out an update which would have allowed\n\nthe machines to automatically fix the problem. Unfortunately their infrastructure for distributing the update quickly\n\nbecame overloaded.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nWhen a security solution fails to identify a threat, this is known as a *false negative*.

It is also possible to address false negatives through *Layered Security* a\n\nconcept that we will cover next.\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.2.

{"context": "### 4.3.3. Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host\n\nto have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and typically support a commonly used\n\nservice. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them. Lastly ports 49152 to 65535\n\nare used dynamically by applications as needed.\n\nIt is important to know some commonly used ports as the services running on these ports may be subject to an attack.\n\nWhen scanning a machine, only necessary ports should be open.\n\n:::: table\n\n:::

Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email.

{"context": "### 9.4.3. Isolation and Containment {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__isolation_and_containment}\nThe first step in reaction to an incident is to remove the asset from the network so that the damage does not spread. It\n\nis standard procedure for malware to attempt to spread to other machines and the fastest way for it to do that is\n\nthrough an internal network. By isolating the infected asset, we can help prevent this.\n\nThere are a few other tools for containing malware such as sandboxing and snapshots. Sandboxing refers to the practice\n\nof running processes in a controlled environment on a machine. Most web browsers sandbox the JavaScript they run,\n\nmeaning that if a website is serving malicious JS it should not be able to affect anything else on the machine.\n\nSnapshots refer to periodically saving the state of the storage device on a machine.

Recovery {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__recovery}\nRecovery can be a long process, but it is the core of responding to an incident.

Backups make recovery much simpler and\n\ncompanies that do not have a backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That being said, malware\n\nmay have also found its way into the backups if given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically\n\ndestroyed and a new one is built. While this can take a long time, it is one of the few ways to know for sure that the\n\nasset isn't compromised.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"9.4.5.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Least Privilege\"}\n\n\n### 7.1.1. Least Privilege {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__least_privilege}\nThe principle of least privilege states that an actor should only be given access to resources as necessary and with the\n\npermissions necessary to complete their task. These resources may be processes, programs, or even user accounts. This\n\nprinciple reduces an attack surface and helps stop the spread of malware as a single compromised account will not have\n\naccess to all of the resources.\n\nLeast privilege is also an important concept for compliance purposes. For example, laws may require and audit of all\n\naccounts that have Internet access. By limiting accounts that have Internet access to only the accounts of actors that\n\nrequire Internet access to complete their tasks, it makes it easier to be in compliance.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.1.2.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__multi_factor_authentication_mfa}\nMulti-factor authentication is a technique that requires actors to provide two or more pieces of information to be used\n\nas identification. Some examples of identification would be usernames and passwords, token codes, a physical token, or\n\nbiometric data. Typically it is suggested to use \\\"something you have and something you know\\\" for example the code in\n\nan SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password (you know your password).\n\nThere are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the time based creation of a code.

A cloud user\n\nmight not want to have to admin an entire Linux server, or even a Linux container just to run their application. They\n\nmay be willing to design the application to work directly within a system that the cloud provider creates.\n\n[Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/){.link} is an example of such a system.

Proxies and receive and send requests on behalf of a\n\nuser, allowing for full control over the traffic going out and coming back in.\n\nProxies can be used for caching, access control, URL filtering, content scanning, and even packet inspection. Proxy\n\nsolutions may be explicit or transparent and are offered by many companies including McAfee, Fortigate, Netsparker, and\n\nPalo Alto. A typical application of a proxy would be to filter explicit content on a school district network.\n\nProxies can also be broken into *forward* and *reverse* configurations. A forward proxy passes requests from a private\n\nor internal network to the internet. Forward proxies can speed up local requests through caching and validate that the\n\nrequest should be performed. Forward proxies are interoperable with standard firewalls and network address translation\n\n(NAT).\n\nReverse proxies take requests from an external source and pass it to an internal service. This helps prevent clients\n\nfrom having direct access to internal services. Reverse proxies can utilize caching and validate requests as well. A\n\nreverse proxy can also be configured to work with a firewall. Whereas it used to be common practice to place a server in\n\na demilitarized zone (DMZ) outside of a firewall, it is now far more common to employ a reverse proxy to reach that\n\nserver.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.3.

{"context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

{"context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1.

This architectural approach replaces the older DMZ model by placing an additional control layer between external clients and internal resources.", "question_token_count": 38, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 45, "choices": null}

{"context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1.

Symmetric Encryption {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__symmetric_encryption}\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/symmetric.svg\" width=\"550\" alt=\"symmetric\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSymmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand in that it only uses a single key (in this case\n\nour key is labelled \\'A\\') to encrypt or decrypt data. Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7.

Theoretical schemes like the one-time pad offer perfect secrecy only if the key is truly random, used once, and kept secret; using predictable or commonly known keys negates these requirements, allowing adversaries to reconstruct the plaintext and thus undermining the security guarantees.", "question_token_count": 60, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 9, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 49, "choices": null}

Least Privilege\"}\n\n\n### 7.1.1. Least Privilege {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__least_privilege}\nThe principle of least privilege states that an actor should only be given access to resources as necessary and with the\n\npermissions necessary to complete their task. These resources may be processes, programs, or even user accounts. This\n\nprinciple reduces an attack surface and helps stop the spread of malware as a single compromised account will not have\n\naccess to all of the resources.\n\nLeast privilege is also an important concept for compliance purposes. For example, laws may require and audit of all\n\naccounts that have Internet access. By limiting accounts that have Internet access to only the accounts of actors that\n\nrequire Internet access to complete their tasks, it makes it easier to be in compliance.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.1.2.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__multi_factor_authentication_mfa}\nMulti-factor authentication is a technique that requires actors to provide two or more pieces of information to be used\n\nas identification. Some examples of identification would be usernames and passwords, token codes, a physical token, or\n\nbiometric data. Typically it is suggested to use \\\"something you have and something you know\\\" for example the code in\n\nan SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password (you know your password).\n\nThere are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the time based creation of a code.

{"context": "### 7.2.3. Key Cards {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__key_cards}\nMany security measures employ key cards for access to rooms. A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

{"context": "### 8.2.4. PHI/HIPPA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__phihippa}\nProtected Health Information (PHI) is another type of protected data covered by various legal and industry standards.\n\nPHI may be a medical history, admissions information for medical facilities, prescription information, or health\n\ninsurance data.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides standards for how PHI should be handled. In\n\naccordance with HIPAA PHI can only be disclosed to certain parties, users have a right to see and correct PHI, and PHI\n\nmust be securely stored and transmitted.\n\nIf you've ever wondered why your health care provider always sends you to a secure portal instead of emailing you the\n\ndetails of your visit, it is because they are dealing with PHI and email is not considered secure.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.2.5. SOX/GLBA\"}\n\n\n### 8.2.5. SOX/GLBA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__soxglba}\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was passed following the busting of the dotcom bubble to help combat financial fraud. SOX\n\ndetails some basic CIA measures (as do most regulations):\n\n::: description-list\n\n[Confidentiality]{.term}\n\n:   [encryption, data loss prevention]{.principal}\n\n[Integrity]{.term}\n\n:   [access control, logging]{.principal}\n\n[Accessibility]{.term}\n\n:   [data retention, audits, public disclosure of breaches]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThe interesting thing is that these controls also make it harder for a company to lie about its dealings. By retaining\n\nrecords for 90 days, tracking changes, and requiring public disclosure, SOX makes it harder for corporations to commit\n\nfraud.\n\nThe Gram-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is another act designed to protect CIA and provide more information for the customer.\n\nThe GLBA mandates that a financial institution must explain what they do with customer information, offer the customer\n\nthe right to opt-out, and make sure the vendors they work with are in compliance.\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.2.6.

Secure portals are designed to meet these regulatory requirements by offering controlled access, encryption, and audit capabilities, thereby ensuring confidentiality and integrity during transmission and storage of PHI.", "question_token_count": 32, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 28, "choices": null}

Least Privilege {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__least_privilege}\nThe principle of least privilege states that an actor should only be given access to resources as necessary and with the\n\npermissions necessary to complete their task. These resources may be processes, programs, or even user accounts. This\n\nprinciple reduces an attack surface and helps stop the spread of malware as a single compromised account will not have\n\naccess to all of the resources.\n\nLeast privilege is also an important concept for compliance purposes. For example, laws may require and audit of all\n\naccounts that have Internet access. By limiting accounts that have Internet access to only the accounts of actors that\n\nrequire Internet access to complete their tasks, it makes it easier to be in compliance.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.1.2.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__multi_factor_authentication_mfa}\nMulti-factor authentication is a technique that requires actors to provide two or more pieces of information to be used\n\nas identification. Some examples of identification would be usernames and passwords, token codes, a physical token, or\n\nbiometric data. Typically it is suggested to use \\\"something you have and something you know\\\" for example the code in\n\nan SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password (you know your password).\n\nThere are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the time based creation of a code.

{"context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1.

Tools of the Trade {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tools_of_the_trade}\nWith all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the question remains, \\\"What can be done?\\\" There\n\nare a few tools the security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture including: *user\n\nawareness*, *anti-malware software*, *backups*, and *encryption*.\n\n::: description-list\n\n[User Awareness]{.term}\n\n:   [A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform\n\n    other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure.

It is often used for data validation\n\nas a relatively small hash *digest* or *signature* can demonstrate the integrity of a large block of data. Hashes can\n\nalso be used so that sensitive information does not have to be stored in cleartext. By storing a hash of a password, you\n\ncan check to see if the correct password was entered without storing the password itself. In the case of a data breach\n\nonly the hashes are leaked and the attacker does not have access to the passwords to try with other services.\n\nTwo main families of hash algorithms are used: MD5 and SHA. MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value and is still often used to\n\nverify data integrity. The algorithm is technically cryptographically broken, but you may still see it in use. The SHA\n\nfamily of algorithms consists of SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [SHA-1: 160 bits, similar to MD5, designed by the NSA, no longer approved for cryptographic use]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-2: SHA-256 and SHA-512, very common with the number indicating the block size, designed by the NSA]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-3: non-NSA designed, not widely adopted, similar numbering scheme as SHA-2 (SHA3-256, etc.)]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nDictionary based attacks against password hashes are fairly common. Typically software is used which generates a hash\n\nfor every word in the dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the compromised machine. One way to\n\ncombat this is through salting or adding random bits to each password. When salting the bits are stored with the hash.\n\nThis forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a\n\nstored table (rainbow table) of all the possible hashes. It can make attacks go from instant to days or even years\n\ndepending on the complexity of the password.\n\nAn even better way of combating attacks against hashes is through a secret salt or *pepper*. A pepper is a random value\n\nthat is added to the password but not stored with the resulting hash. The random value can be stored in a separate\n\nmedium such as a hardware Security Module.\n\n::::\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.6.

If that data isn't just data, but\n\nactually a JavaScript script, that script may run on the page that displays it.\n\nUsing this technique attackers can access cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information. Depending on where\n\nthe script was injected and how the server displays that data the script could be stored permanently on the target\n\nserver. XSS scripts may also be reflected, typically sent in links, where they are only used for one session.\n\nTo mitigate XSS risks, it is important that a web developer sanitize their inputs.

Hashes {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__hashes}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/hash.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"hash\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nA hashing algorithm is a one-way function that creates hashed text from plaintext. It is often used for data validation\n\nas a relatively small hash *digest* or *signature* can demonstrate the integrity of a large block of data. Hashes can\n\nalso be used so that sensitive information does not have to be stored in cleartext. By storing a hash of a password, you\n\ncan check to see if the correct password was entered without storing the password itself. In the case of a data breach\n\nonly the hashes are leaked and the attacker does not have access to the passwords to try with other services.\n\nTwo main families of hash algorithms are used: MD5 and SHA. MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value and is still often used to\n\nverify data integrity. The algorithm is technically cryptographically broken, but you may still see it in use. The SHA\n\nfamily of algorithms consists of SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [SHA-1: 160 bits, similar to MD5, designed by the NSA, no longer approved for cryptographic use]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-2: SHA-256 and SHA-512, very common with the number indicating the block size, designed by the NSA]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-3: non-NSA designed, not widely adopted, similar numbering scheme as SHA-2 (SHA3-256, etc.)]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nDictionary based attacks against password hashes are fairly common. Typically software is used which generates a hash\n\nfor every word in the dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the compromised machine. One way to\n\ncombat this is through salting or adding random bits to each password. When salting the bits are stored with the hash.\n\nThis forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a\n\nstored table (rainbow table) of all the possible hashes. It can make attacks go from instant to days or even years\n\ndepending on the complexity of the password.\n\nAn even better way of combating attacks against hashes is through a secret salt or *pepper*. A pepper is a random value\n\nthat is added to the password but not stored with the resulting hash. The random value can be stored in a separate\n\nmedium such as a hardware Security Module.\n\n::::\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.6.

Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host\n\nto have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and typically support a commonly used\n\nservice. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them.

This allows the SOC to roll the\n\nmachine back to a previous state, before malware was active.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"9.4.4. Recovery\"}\n\n\n### 9.4.4. Recovery {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__recovery}\nRecovery can be a long process, but it is the core of responding to an incident. If it is possible to remove malware\n\nfrom a machine, that action is taken in this step. Breached accounts are also disabled.\n\nUnfortunately it may be impossible to roll back some assets to a previously uncompromised state, in which case they may\n\nneed to be restored from a backup or failing that rebuilt from the ground up. Backups make recovery much simpler and\n\ncompanies that do not have a backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That being said, malware\n\nmay have also found its way into the backups if given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically\n\ndestroyed and a new one is built. While this can take a long time, it is one of the few ways to know for sure that the\n\nasset isn't compromised.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"9.4.5.

As it states, it is a simple protocol consisting of\n\nlines of text. Basic SMTP used TCP on port 25. SMTP was later expanded to support authentication and finally wrapped in\n\nTLS still using TCP on port 587. SMTP servers accept outgoing mail from (hopefully) authenticated clients, route mail to\n\nother SMTP servers based on the Mail Exchange (MX) information in DNS records, and accept mail for their domain from\n\nother SMTP servers. Various checks have been implemented in SMTP servers to ensure that messages from domains *actually*\n\ncome from those domains.

{"context": "### 7.2.3. Key Cards {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__key_cards}\nMany security measures employ key cards for access to rooms. A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.
