( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Develop a critical understanding of the role of sensory feedback in rehabilitation", "question": "How can the use of sensory feedback in prosthetics be optimized to minimize phantom limb pain and promote embodiment of the prosthetic limb, and what are some of the challenges associated with developing validated measurements for assessing this aspect of rehabilitation?", "choices": {"A": "The use of sensory feedback in prosthetics can be optimized by providing a controlled and consistent sensory experience, such as tactile or proprioceptive feedback, to help the individual adapt to the prosthetic limb and reduce phantom limb pain.", "B": "The development of validated measurements for assessing the use of sensory feedback in prosthetics is hindered by the complex etiology of phantom limb pain and the lack of standardization in assessment tools.", "C": "The embodiment of the prosthetic limb can be improved by using sensory feedback that is tailored to the individual's specific needs and preferences, such as using a combination of tactile and proprioceptive feedback.", "D": "The use of sensory feedback in prosthetics is limited by the need for significant advances in technology and materials science to provide a comfortable and natural user experience."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer is A, as the use of sensory feedback in prosthetics can be optimized by providing a controlled and consistent sensory experience to help the individual adapt to the prosthetic limb and reduce phantom limb pain.

{"context": "## 5.1. Sensors for Proprioception\nProprioception is not only fundamental for a dexterous hand prosthesis, enabling vision-free manipulation and multitasking, but is also the key to a properly embodied device (64). Usually, kinematic parameters of the robotic hand and (when available) the force exerted are needed to implement low-level control of the actuators, so they are measured with well-established systems, such as rotary encoders or the motor's current draw.\n\n\n## 5.2. Tactile Sensors\nDespite improvements in sensor miniaturization,computational power,and knowledge of the neurophysiology of somatosensation (tactile sensation and proprioception), the capabilities of sensorized RPHs remain far from those of a natural hand. Overcoming this limitation will require satisfying three conditions: The sensors must match the skin's sensing ability, a sufficient number of sensors must be embedded on the surface of the hand, and it must be possible to reliably read information from them. The first condition can be addressed with current technology, as the resolution of existing force and pressure sensors already matches human skin performance (120). However, fulfilling the second and third conditions is another matter, and we need to push the boundaries of circuit integration in order to create an RPH with many sensors and a way to communicate with them.\n\nThe classical solution of using general-purpose sensors developed separately from the signal conditioning circuit and the subsequent signal processing has shown its limit. Instead, efforts are being made to optimize these devices with prosthetics in mind. For example, borrowing the concept of morphological computation from robotics (121), sensors can be optimized for specific tasks by tuning the features of their mechanical structures accordingly. Indeed, exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination (61, 115). Another example comes from Kim et al. (122), who measured forces using sensors embedded in a soft substrate.\n\n)\n\nContinued\n\n(\n\n| Sensor distribution a                       |            |             |             |             |                  |              |                 |              |\n\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n\n| Interface                                   | G10 tactor | TIME        | TENS        | TIME        | FINE             | TIME         | Vibrators       | TENS         |\n\n| Electrical stimulation encoding Pulse width | -          | Fixed       | Linear      | Fixed       | Time variant     | Fixed        | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Amplitude                                   | -          | Linear      | Fixed       | Model based | Fixed            | Fixed        | -               | Fixed        |\n\n| Frequency                                   | -          | Fixed       | Fixed       | Model based | Linear           | Neuromorphic | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Mechanical stimulation encoding             | Linear     | -           | -           | -           | -                | -            | Discrete events | -            |\n\n| RPH model                                   | Passive    | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | SensorHand Speed | IH2 Azzurra  | Various         | bebionic     |\n\n| Reference                                   | 4          | 6           | 60          | 62          | 38               | 61           | 129             | 59           |\n\n| Year                                        | 2011       | 2014        | 2017        | 2018        | 2014             | 2016         | 2016            | 2018         |\n", "topic": "How can the limitations of current sensor technologies be addressed through innovative solutions, such as vibration-based sensing or soft substrate sensors?", "question": "How can the limitations of current sensor technologies, such as those discussed in the context of prosthetic limbs, be effectively addressed through innovative solutions like vibration-based sensing or soft substrate sensors, and what are the potential implications of such advancements for the development of advanced prosthetic limbs?", "choices": {"A": "Implementing vibration-based sensing technologies could enable more precise and accurate prosthetic control by leveraging the unique properties of vibration to detect subtle changes in the environment.", "B": "Soft substrate sensors offer a promising approach to addressing the limitations of current sensor technologies by providing a more sensitive and responsive sensing mechanism that can be integrated into prosthetic limbs.", "C": "The development of advanced prosthetic limbs using innovative sensor solutions like vibration-based sensing or soft substrate sensors may have significant implications for the field of prosthetics, including improved control, increased dexterity, and enhanced user experience.", "D": "The use of vibration-based sensing technologies in prosthetic limbs may require significant advancements in signal processing and processing algorithms to accurately interpret and translate the vibrational signals into meaningful control signals."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer, C, is supported by the text, which highlights the potential implications of advanced sensor solutions for the development of advanced prosthetic limbs.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Potential Risks and Challenges of Event-Based Architectures in Robotics", "question": "What are the primary advantages of event-based architectures in robotics, particularly in handling many sensors at the same time?", "choices": {"C": "Enhanced scalability by minimizing wiring complexity", "D": "Increased accuracy by using traditional protocols", "A": "nswer: B: Improved data rate through sparsity of data representation", "B": "Improved data rate through sparsity of data representation"}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "Event-based architectures offer several advantages, including reduced communication line requirements and improved data rate through the sparsity of data representation.

( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ).

( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Assess the importance of considering biopsychosocial welfare in rehabilitation", "question": "How can the assessment of biopsychosocial welfare in rehabilitation be improved using prosthetics with sensory feedback, and what are the potential implications for amputees with phantom limb pain?", "choices": {"D": "The use of prosthetics with sensory feedback can provide a more effective and efficient rehabilitation process, as it can help to improve the motor skills and cognitive load of amputees.", "B": "The assessment of biopsychosocial welfare in rehabilitation can be improved by considering the multifaceted aspects of the impairment, including cognitive load, embodiment, and the embodiment of prosthetic devices.", "A": "The use of prosthetics with sensory feedback can alleviate phantom limb pain and improve the biopsychosocial welfare of amputees by providing a more immersive and engaging experience.", "C": "Prosthetics with sensory feedback can be used to measure the embodiment of prosthetic devices, which can provide valuable insights into the biopsychosocial welfare of amputees."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B, as the assessment of biopsychosocial welfare in rehabilitation can be improved by considering the multifaceted aspects of the impairment, including cognitive load, embodiment, and the embodiment of prosthetic devices.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers. Sensory remapping (65) can be another viable solution to simulate temperature feedback on a different part of the body using a temperature display.\n", "topic": "Future electrodes with higher selectivity are required to target A \u03b4 and C fibers, and alternative approaches such as sensory remapping can be explored.", "question": "What are the key challenges and potential solutions for future electrodes that can target A \u03b4 and C fibers, which mediate temperature sensation, and how do these relate to existing technologies and alternative approaches?", "choices": {"C": "Sensory remapping can be a viable solution to simulate temperature feedback on a different part of the body using a temperature display.", "D": "The stimulation being close to the target is a major limitation of current technologies, which requires the most invasive solutions.", "A": "The main advancement in electrode technology so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation.", "B": "Temperature sensation is limited by the small size of A \u03b4 and C fibers, which makes it difficult to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B, as it highlights the key challenge of targeting A \u03b4 and C fibers due to their small size, and the limitations of existing technologies.

Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes.

The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly.

( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Event-Based Architectures for Efficient Sensor Processing", "question": "What is the primary advantage of event-based architectures over traditional time-sharing and space-sharing techniques in sensor processing?", "choices": {"C": "Reduced wiring complexity and improved scalability", "B": "Increased data rate", "D": "Improved decoding stage for sensor value acquisition", "A": "nswer: C: Reduced wiring complexity and improved scalability"}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "Event-based architectures are designed to handle many sensors simultaneously by only signaling their value when it changes by more than a certain threshold.

The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Explore the relationship between sensory feedback and phantom limb pain in patients with amputation", "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which prosthetics with sensory feedback alleviate phantom limb pain in amputees?", "choices": {"D": "Enhanced tactile feedback", "A": "Nociceptive mechanisms", "C": "Changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic", "B": "Neuropathic mechanisms"}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C, as changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic have been observed when tactile or proprioceptive feedback is provided to the subject, which is a key factor in alleviating phantom limb pain.

{"context": "## 5.4. Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n", "topic": "Describe the trade-offs between different feedback techniques, including their effects on timing, position, and modality.", "question": "What are the primary advantages and disadvantages of using noninvasive sensory feedback techniques in prosthetic limbs, and how do they compare to invasive feedback methods?", "choices": {"A": "Noninvasive feedback techniques, such as vibration and touch, offer precise timing and position control, but are limited by their mechanical delay and difficulty in miniaturization.", "B": "Noninvasive feedback techniques, such as vibration and touch, offer precise timing and position control, and are advantageous due to their non-surgical nature, but are limited by their mechanical delay and integration challenges.", "C": "Invasive feedback techniques, such as position feedback, offer real-time control and integration with the nervous system, but require surgical interventions and have limitations in terms of precision and coherence.", "D": "Invasive feedback techniques, such as position feedback, offer real-time control and integration with the nervous system, and are advantageous due to their ability to bypass mechanical limitations, but require surgical interventions and have limitations in terms of precision and coherence."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The question requires the test-taker to analyze the trade-offs between noninvasive and invasive sensory feedback techniques in prosthetic limbs.

{"context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "Advanced Mechatronic Solutions for Neuroprosthetic Hand Development", "question": "What are the primary challenges in developing a neuroprosthetic hand that can mimic the functions of a hand, and how can advanced mechatronic solutions address these challenges?", "choices": {"C": "The primary challenge in developing a neuroprosthetic hand is the requirement for a user-centered approach, which prioritizes ease of learning, natural use, and independence.", "D": "The primary challenge in developing a neuroprosthetic hand is the technical limitation of current materials and manufacturing techniques, which hinder the creation of dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands.", "A": "The primary challenge in developing a neuroprosthetic hand is the complexity of hand functions, including grasping and coordination tasks, which require a high density of mechanoreceptors and a large number of degrees of freedom.", "B": "The primary challenge in developing a neuroprosthetic hand is the need for a robust and effective interface with users' nervous systems, which requires new approaches for seamless natural-artificial integration."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B, as the primary challenge in developing a neuroprosthetic hand is the need for a robust and effective interface with users' nervous systems, which requires new approaches for seamless natural-artificial integration.", "question_token_count": 34, "answer_correctness_score": 8, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 37}
{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "What are the potential applications of neural interfaces in the treatment of neurological disorders?", "question": "What are the potential applications of biomimetic stimulation patterns in neural interfaces for the treatment of neurological disorders?", "choices": {"C": "Biomimetic stimulation patterns are limited in their ability to elicit precise sensations, and their use in neural interfaces is not yet supported by sufficient evidence.", "D": "The use of biomimetic stimulation patterns in neural interfaces has been met with skepticism by the medical community due to concerns about their safety and efficacy.", "A": "The use of biomimetic stimulation patterns can improve the naturalness and intuitiveness of sensations evoked by neural interfaces, leading to improved performance and embodiment in individuals with neurological disorders.", "B": "Biomimetic stimulation patterns have been shown to be more informative than standard modulation techniques, but their impact on the treatment of neurological disorders is still unclear."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer, A, is supported by the text, which highlights the potential of biomimetic stimulation patterns to improve the naturalness and intuitiveness of sensations evoked by neural interfaces.

{"context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section.

MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach.

The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al.

{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Discuss the role of peripheral nervous system interfaces in sensory feedback.", "question": "How do biomimetic stimulation patterns differ from traditional modulation techniques in evoking natural sensations, and what are the implications for the development of peripheral nervous system interfaces?", "choices": {"C": "Biomimetic stimulation patterns have been shown to be less sensitive than traditional modulation techniques, but they can elicit more natural sensations in users.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42).

In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Discuss the challenges of evaluating patients with rehabilitation", "question": "Discuss the challenges of evaluating patients with rehabilitation, particularly those with prosthetic limbs, and explain the importance of sensory feedback in this context.", "choices": {"C": "The embodiment of prosthetic limbs is a critical aspect of rehabilitation, and changes in body schema representation and embodiment can occur when tactile or proprioceptive feedback is provided to patients.

In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Potential Risks and Challenges of Event-Based Architectures in Medical Imaging", "question": "What is a potential limitation of event-based architectures in medical imaging, and how can it be addressed?", "choices": {"C": "The underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by the communication mechanisms of neurons, but this may not translate well to complex medical imaging applications.", "A": "The use of a high rate of polling for individual sensors can lead to increased power consumption and heat generation.", "B": "The sparsity of data representation in event-based architectures can result in increased complexity and difficulty in decoding sensor values.", "D": "The need for a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition can limit the scalability of event-based architectures in medical imaging."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth).

{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Discuss the importance of naturalness and intuitiveness in neural interfaces.", "question": "What are the key challenges and limitations associated with developing neural interfaces that elicit complex and natural sensations, such as texture and embodiment, and how can these challenges be addressed?", "choices": {"C": "The development of neural interfaces that elicit complex and natural sensations is a complex task.

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n", "topic": "Researching and Developing New Prosthetic Hands", "question": "How can the integration of biomimetic actuators, sensors, and electronic components into prosthetic hands be achieved while maintaining a balance between size, weight, and dexterity, and what are the potential trade-offs in terms of control robustness and energy efficiency?", "choices": {"C": "Employing underactuation approaches to simplify the mechanics while maintaining reasonable dexterity, which can reduce the number of motors needed but may limit control robustness.", "A": "Implementing muscle-like actuators and skeleton-like structures to mimic human biomechanics, which can lead to improved dexterity but may compromise control robustness.", "B": "Utilizing passive degrees of freedom to adapt to the surface in contact, which can enable self-adjusting grips without the need for complex control systems.", "D": "Developing advanced control interfaces, such as coil drivers and cable design, to enhance control robustness but may increase the size and weight of the prosthetic hand."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer is a combination of biomimetic actuation and passive degrees of freedom, as discussed in the context.

{"context": "## 4. MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach. Section 4.1 details different algorithmic approaches to decode motor functions, with an emphasis on sEMG; Section 4.2 discusses the addition of robotic automation to improve grasp robustness; Section 4.3 compares implanted methods to extract the user's intentions; and finally, Section 4.4 presents a perspective on the broader adoption of these techniques by patients.

{"context": "## 5.5. Perspectives\nWe believe that sensorization will play a significant role in the next generation of RPHs. Here, we discuss three main directions influenced by sensorization: embedded sensorization, improved stimulation strategies, and new computational architectures.\n\n5.5.1. Embedded sensorization. Sensorized hands are not yet prevalent in the literature but are starting to draw interest, especially with the improvement of interfaces for bidirectional prostheses (for a list of RPHs with sensorized fingertips, see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). As a recent example, Controzzi et al. (141) developed the Mia hand (Prensilia, Italy), which is integrated with sensors that can measure normal and tangential forces at the fingertips. Sensorization of RPHs is a design requirement that should be considered as important as other functional requirements for hand prostheses, such as weight or dexterity. T o improve RPH performance and sensor integration, next-generation RPHs should then be designed with their sensorization in mind. Information about hand state (joint position, forces, and touch) can also be beneficial to increase the dexterity of such hands, enabling automatic adjustments such as catching slipping objects (e.g., the bebionic3 hand) and shared-control strategies (see Section 4).\n\n5.5.2. Improved stimulation strategies. Biomimicry is one of the strongest trends in nerve stimulation strategies, as it promises to deliver biologically plausible stimulation patterns to evoke more natural sensations. Biomimetic approaches rely on bio-inspired models to compute the stimulation patterns, so new iterations of these models, based on the current experience in stimulation and neural recording, are needed to improve the quality of elicited sensations.\n\nThese model-based approaches permit simpler modulation strategies that increase the naturalness of sensations. T an et al. (38), for example, proved that a sinusoidal modulation of the pulse width improves the naturalness of the sensation. Formento et al. (142) instead designed a strategy to activate asynchronously stimulated fibers, mimicking healthy neural activity; in their work, they replaced classical biphasic stimulation with a high-frequency burst of pulses that slowly increased in amplitude, and confirmed their hypothesis in ex vivo experiments. Stimulation patterns that try to overcome the physical limits of present neural interfaces (as in 142) while paving the way for more natural evoked sensations also suggest the requirements for the future generation of neural interfaces and stimulators for sensory feedback: increase reaching without losing discrimination.\n\n5.5.3. New computational architectures. Neuromorphic architectures have the potential to represent a paradigm shift in the design of the control systems for bidirectional hand prostheses, going toward distributed systems and edge computing. Both sensor acquisition and stimulation can benefit from these trends because they lead to more reliable systems that scale well with the increase of sensors and stimulation active sites. If the next generation of neuromorphic hardware promotes portability and lower power consumption, it could lead to broader implementation and adoption of neuromorphic systems in bidirectional hand prostheses.\n\nMany RPHs rely on advanced encoding and decoding algorithms implemented with neural networks (62), which are more computationally demanding than traditional approaches. It is interesting that even deep learning networks can be translated into spiking neural networks (143), possibly enabling full neuromorphic hardware encoding and decoding in future prostheses.\n", "topic": "How can neuromorphic architectures contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient RPHs?", "question": "How can neuromorphic architectures contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient RPHs, considering the potential benefits of sensorization and biomimicry in stimulation strategies?", "choices": {"C": "By integrating sensorization and neuromorphic architectures, RPHs can gain enhanced dexterity and performance, enabling automatic adjustments and shared-control strategies that improve user experience.", "D": "Neuromorphic architectures can improve the computational demands of RPHs by translating neural networks into spiking neural networks, potentially enabling full neuromorphic hardware encoding and decoding in future prostheses.", "A": "By enabling distributed systems and edge computing, neuromorphic architectures can improve the reliability and efficiency of RPHs, while also reducing power consumption and increasing scalability.", "B": "Through the use of biomimicry in stimulation strategies, neuromorphic architectures can improve the naturalness and discrimination of sensations in RPHs, leading to more intuitive control and user acceptance."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer (A) highlights the potential benefits of neuromorphic architectures in improving the reliability and efficiency of RPHs, while also reducing power consumption and increasing scalability.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Potential Future Developments in Robotics", "question": "What are the primary advantages of event-based architectures in handling multiple sensors simultaneously, and how do they compare to traditional time-sharing and space-sharing techniques?", "choices": {"A": "The primary advantage of event-based architectures is the reduced amount of data transmitted, which minimizes the need for complex communication protocols and reduces wiring complexity.", "B": "Event-based architectures offer improved data rates compared to traditional time-sharing and space-sharing techniques, making them suitable for applications that require high-speed data transmission.", "C": "The underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by the human brain's neural communication methods, where neurons send trains of spikes instead of continuous value.", "D": "Event-based architectures have the potential to increase system complexity, requiring additional decoding stages to acquire sensor values, which may not be suitable for all applications."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer, A, highlights the primary advantage of event-based architectures, which is the reduced amount of data transmitted.

{"context": "## 4. MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach. Section 4.1 details different algorithmic approaches to decode motor functions, with an emphasis on sEMG; Section 4.2 discusses the addition of robotic automation to improve grasp robustness; Section 4.3 compares implanted methods to extract the user's intentions; and finally, Section 4.4 presents a perspective on the broader adoption of these techniques by patients.

{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Discuss the potential of neural interfaces in enhancing embodiment.", "question": "What are the primary advantages and limitations of invasive neural stimulation compared to noninvasive approaches in peripheral nervous system interfaces, and how do these differences impact the potential for neural interfaces to enhance embodiment?", "choices": {"D": "The limitations of invasive neural stimulation include its complexity, invasiveness, and potential for technical issues, such as interference with EMG readings, while noninvasive approaches are limited in their spatial precision and informativeness.", "C": "The primary advantage of invasive neural stimulation is its ability to elicit complex and natural sensations, such as texture, and improve user experience, but it is also more expensive and technically challenging compared to noninvasive approaches.", "A": "Invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback.

{"context": "## 5.4. Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n", "topic": "Explain the concept of synchronicity in feedback techniques and its impact on user experience.", "question": "Explain the concept of synchronicity in feedback techniques and its impact on user experience in the context of prosthetic devices.", "choices": {"A": "Synchronicity in feedback techniques refers to the ability to deliver a precise and coherent sensation that matches the desired one in terms of timing, position, and modality.", "B": "Synchronicity in feedback techniques is a crucial aspect of prosthetic devices, as it enables users to accurately perceive their movements and interactions with the device.", "C": "The concept of synchronicity in feedback techniques is closely tied to the development of more intuitive and user-friendly prosthetic devices, which require precise and coherent feedback to enhance user experience.", "D": "Synchronicity in feedback techniques is a challenging aspect of prosthetic devices, as it requires the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors to deliver a precise and coherent sensation."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer (A) is the most accurate and concise explanation of the concept of synchronicity in feedback techniques.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Applications of Event-Based Architectures", "question": "How do event-based architectures address the challenge of handling multiple sensors simultaneously, and what advantages do they offer over traditional time-sharing and space-sharing techniques?", "choices": {"A": "By using pulses to encode information, event-based architectures can significantly improve data rates and reduce the number of electrical connections required.", "B": "Event-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta, where sensors only signal their value when it changes by more than a certain threshold, preserving the time structure of the stimulus.", "C": "The underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value.", "D": "Event-based architectures are limited by the need for a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, which can be a significant bottleneck in high-performance systems."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "Event-based architectures offer several advantages over traditional time-sharing and space-sharing techniques, including reduced wiring complexity, improved data rates, and the ability to handle multiple sensors simultaneously.

The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Assess the importance", "question": "What are the limitations of current assessment tools for evaluating the effectiveness of sensory feedback in prosthetic limbs, and how can novel technologies address these limitations?", "choices": {"D": "The current assessment tools are insufficient for evaluating the long-term effects of sensory feedback on prosthetic use and do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between sensory feedback and prosthetic use.", "C": "The limitations of current assessment tools are primarily due to the lack of standardization and the inability to account for individual differences in sensory perception and prosthetic use.", "A": "The current assessment tools have limitations in measuring the complexity of sensory feedback and its impact on prosthetic use, leading to a lack of standardization and consistency in evaluating the effectiveness of sensory feedback.", "B": "The current assessment tools are based on outdated technologies and do not account for the dynamic nature of sensory feedback, resulting in inaccurate measurements and conclusions."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the limitations of current assessment tools in evaluating the effectiveness of sensory feedback in prosthetic limbs.

Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Discuss the implications of sensory feedback on patients' experiences and outcomes", "question": "How does the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback influence patients' embodiment and perception of their prosthetic limbs, and what are the implications of this feedback on their experiences and outcomes?", "choices": {"C": "The use of prosthetics with sensory feedback can lead to increased embodiment and perception of patients' prosthetic limbs, but its impact on phantom limb pain is uncertain and may vary depending on individual factors.", "D": "Prosthetics with sensory feedback are not effective in reducing phantom limb pain and may even exacerbate it in some patients.", "A": "The use of prosthetics with sensory feedback can significantly reduce phantom limb pain and improve patients' adaptation to their prosthetic limbs, leading to a more positive experience and better outcomes.", "B": "Sensory feedback plays a limited role in patients' embodiment and perception of their prosthetic limbs, and its use has no significant impact on their experiences and outcomes."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer is A, as the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback has been shown to significantly reduce phantom limb pain and improve patients' adaptation to their prosthetic limbs.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Potential Future Developments in Sensory Systems", "question": "Design an event-based sensory architecture that can efficiently handle a large number of sensors, considering both scalability and latency.", "choices": {"A": "Time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques can be used to minimize wiring complexity and reduce read latency.", "B": "Event-based systems rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor signals its value only when it changes by more than a certain threshold.", "C": "The use of pulses of 20 ns can improve data rate, as demonstrated by Bartolozzi et al.

{"context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "Robust and Effective Interfaces for Neuroprosthetic Systems", "question": "What is a critical challenge in developing stable interfaces for neuroprosthetic systems, and how can researchers overcome this hurdle to improve the quality of life for amputee patients?", "choices": {"A": "The lack of standardization in interface design, leading to inconsistent performance across different devices.", "B": "The limited understanding of neural signals and their relationship to motor intentions, making it difficult to decode and interpret user input.", "C": "The need for more advanced algorithms to process and interpret the vast amounts of data generated by sensorized prosthetic hands.", "D": "The difficulty in creating a seamless natural-artificial integration between the prosthetic and the user's nervous system, resulting in a learning curve that hinders adoption."}, "answer": "D", "explanation": "This question requires the domain expert to think critically about the challenges in developing stable interfaces for neuroprosthetic systems.

{"context": "## 4. MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach. Section 4.1 details different algorithmic approaches to decode motor functions, with an emphasis on sEMG; Section 4.2 discusses the addition of robotic automation to improve grasp robustness; Section 4.3 compares implanted methods to extract the user's intentions; and finally, Section 4.4 presents a perspective on the broader adoption of these techniques by patients.

( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ).

When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers.

(139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Discuss the role of peripheral nervous system interfaces in sensory feedback.", "question": "What are the primary advantages and limitations of invasive peripheral nervous system stimulation compared to noninvasive strategies in sensory feedback?", "choices": {"D": "The dependence on sensor thresholds on the stimulation position, which forces a calibration after each mounting.", "A": "The ability to elicit natural sensations through direct stimulation of the nerves.", "B": "The technical issues with long-term applications, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time.", "C": "The need for surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "Invasive peripheral nervous system stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback.

{"context": "## 4.2. Shared Control to Help Motor Decoding\nThe ultimate goal of RPH control is to be as close as possible to controlling a natural hand. Therefore, an ideal control needs to be intuitive and continuous over individual fingers and wrist movements. Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder. Since reliability is one of the main factors for upper-limb prosthesis users (102), this is a significant issue for the commercialization of more dexterous control schemes.\n\nOne possible solution to improve decoding robustness is to add robotic automation of some portion of the motor command. Shared-control strategies between a subject and a smart robotic hand have been reported for automated preshaping and grasping (103), grip force adjustment\n\n(104), slip detection, and hand closing (105). In the context of single-finger proportional control, Zhuang et al. (79) proposed a shared-control strategy to increase grasp robustness (avoiding accidental drops), by maximizing the number of contacts between the RPH and an object while allowing the user to maintain full autonomy over decisions about grasping and releasing, grasp preshaping, and non-grasp-related motions. These strategies allow both freedom during singlefinger control and robustness during a grasp event (79) and can perform more dexterous movements that cannot be decoded based on EMG alone. However, they necessitate many DOAs (e.g., active control of each phalanx to reposition the fingers around an object), which is still a significant challenge in terms of motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\n", "topic": "Explain the concept of shared-control strategies in prosthetic control, including their potential benefits and limitations.", "question": "Explain the potential benefits and limitations of shared-control strategies in prosthetic control, including their impact on motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.", "choices": {"C": "Shared-control strategies can help to improve the robustness of prosthetic decoders, but they may require significant advances in motor miniaturization and power consumption.", "A": "Shared-control strategies can increase grasp robustness and dexterity, but they require multiple DOAs, which can be a significant challenge in terms of miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.", "B": "Shared-control strategies can be used to automate certain aspects of prosthetic control, but they may compromise the user's autonomy and control over the prosthetic.", "D": "Shared-control strategies can be used to develop more dexterous prosthetic control schemes, but they may be limited by the need for multiple DOAs and the associated challenges."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer (A) highlights the potential benefits of shared-control strategies in prosthetic control, including increased grasp robustness and dexterity.

Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42).

MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Comparison with Human Sensory Systems", "question": "What is the primary advantage of event-based architectures in sensory systems, and how do they compare to traditional time-sharing techniques in terms of scalability and communication complexity?", "choices": {"C": "The ability to send signals only when the value changes, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus and reduces latency.", "A": "The ability to handle a large number of sensors simultaneously with minimal wiring complexity, but with a higher risk of breakage.", "B": "The sparsity of data representation, which reduces communication complexity and increases scalability, making it an attractive solution for large-scale sensory systems.", "D": "The use of pulses instead of continuous values, which improves data rate and reduces the need for complex decoding stages."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B, as the primary advantage of event-based architectures is the sparsity of data representation, which reduces communication complexity and increases scalability.

{"context": "## 6. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160). It assesses four basic movements: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movements of extension and flexion at the elbow and shoulder.

INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "Decoding Motor Intentions in Neuroprosthetic Systems", "question": "What are the primary challenges in developing an algorithmic strategy for decoding motor intentions in neuroprosthetic systems, and how do these challenges impact the overall performance of the prosthetic?", "choices": {"C": "Inadequate neural interface stability and reliability", "D": "Inadequate machine learning models for pattern recognition", "A": "C", "B": "Insufficient understanding of motor intention representation in the brain"}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The primary challenges in developing an algorithmic strategy for decoding motor intentions in neuroprosthetic systems include inadequate neural interface stability and reliability, as well as insufficient understanding of motor intention representation in the brain.

{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Evaluate the challenges associated with the development of peripheral nervous system interfaces.", "question": "What is a major limitation of noninvasive electrotactile stimulation that makes it challenging for its application in closed-loop rehabilitation prosthetics (RPHs)?", "choices": {"D": "Technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time.", "C": "Variability in stimulation parameters over time, which impair long-term applications.", "A": "Dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position, which forces a calibration after each mounting.", "B": "Interference with EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer, A, highlights the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position, which forces a calibration after each mounting.

CONCLUSION\nMorethan20years ago,remarkable results by a group of French surgeons for hand transplantation (8) had raised hopes for a future where grafting would be the norm and prosthetics eventually obsolete (176). However, not only has this prediction-unfortunately-not yet come to pass, but also the adoption of new RPH technologies has been slower than expected. As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback. We have proposed here an outline of possible iterations of RPHs for the next few years and for 5-10 years in the future.\n\nIn our view, there could soon be a broader integration of simple somatosensory feedback using mature implantable techniques, such as cuff electrodes. Motor decoding using machine learning and shared-control algorithms could permit continuous command of single fingers and broader sets of grasps. Ultimately, the next generation of prosthetics could use more advanced soft implantable electrodes, which could enable more sophisticated sensory encoding (proprioception, temperature perception, touch perception, and nociception) and motor decoding using, for example, deep learning techniques.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Potential Limitations of Event-Based Architectures in Medical Imaging", "question": "What is a potential limitation of event-based architectures in medical imaging, considering the trade-offs between sparsity of data representation and the need for decoding stages?", "choices": {"C": "Limited scalability in handling a large number of sensors", "A": "Reduced performance due to increased decoding complexity", "B": "Increased power consumption due to the need for multiple communication lines", "D": "Improved data rate due to the use of pulses of 20 ns"}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C, as event-based architectures may struggle to scale in handling a large number of sensors, despite their advantages in data representation and communication complexity.

INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "Patient-Centered Approaches to Neuroprosthetic Design", "question": "What are some of the key challenges and potential solutions in developing patient-centered neuroprosthetic designs that can improve the quality of life for amputee patients?", "choices": {"C": "The main challenge is the high cost and limited accessibility of current neuroprosthetic technologies, which can be addressed through more affordable and user-friendly designs.", "D": "The primary challenge is the lack of standardization in neuroprosthetic designs, which can be overcome through the development of more consistent and patient-centered approaches.", "A": "The main challenge is the complexity of the hand's sensory representation in the brain, requiring a high degree of sensorization and dexterity in the prosthetic.", "B": "The primary challenge is the need for a robust and effective interface between the prosthetic and the nervous system, which can be overcome through advances in algorithmic strategies and sensorization."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B, as it highlights the importance of a robust and effective interface between the prosthetic and the nervous system.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers.

The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Explore the relationship between sensory feedback and phantom limb pain in patients with amputation", "question": "How do the differences in sensory feedback and prosthetic use impact the embodiment of the amputated limb in patients with phantom limb pain, and what are the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms involved?", "choices": {"C": "Phantom limb pain is primarily a nociceptive condition, and the use of sensory feedback and prosthetics does not significantly impact its etiology.", "D": "The neural mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain involve the integration of sensory information from the amputated limb with cognitive representations of the body, which can be influenced by prosthetic use and sensory feedback.", "A": "The use of tactile and proprioceptive feedback in prosthetics can lead to changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the amputated limb, which may contribute to reduced phantom limb pain.", "B": "The embodiment of the amputated limb is primarily influenced by cognitive factors, such as attention and perception, rather than sensory feedback and prosthetic use."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "This question is designed to challenge the domain expert's understanding of the complex relationship between sensory feedback, prosthetic use, and phantom limb pain.

{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Discuss the potential of neural interfaces in enhancing embodiment.", "question": "What are the primary advantages and limitations of invasive neural stimulation techniques, such as peripheral nervous system interfaces, compared to noninvasive approaches, in terms of evoking complex and natural sensations for individuals with amputations or other sensory impairments?", "choices": {"B": "Noninvasive approaches, such as electrotactile feedback and electrocutaneous stimulation, have the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, but are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation.", "A": "Invasive neural stimulation techniques can elicit sensations intuitive for the user, but are limited by technical issues such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time.", "C": "Invasive neural stimulation techniques have the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, but are limited by the complexity of the surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface.", "D": "Noninvasive approaches, such as electrotactile feedback and electrocutaneous stimulation, are limited by technical issues such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time, but can be improved by biomimetic stimulation patterns."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer, A, highlights the primary advantages and limitations of invasive neural stimulation techniques, such as peripheral nervous system interfaces, compared to noninvasive approaches.

MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers.

{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n", "topic": "Potential Applications in Medical Imaging", "question": "What is a potential advantage of event-based architectures in medical imaging, and how do they differ from traditional time-sharing and space-sharing techniques?", "choices": {"C": "By mimicking the sparsity of data representation, event-based architectures can reduce communication latency and increase the speed of information transmission.", "D": "By using pulses of 20 ns, event-based architectures can achieve a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols, but may require additional hardware components.", "A": "By reducing the number of wires needed, event-based architectures can increase performance and scalability in applications requiring high sensor densities.", "B": "By sending spikes instead of continuous values, event-based architectures can improve data rate and efficiency, but may require additional decoding stages."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) highlights a key advantage of event-based architectures, which is the ability to send spikes instead of continuous values, improving data rate and efficiency.

{"context": "## 4.3. Decoding Motor Intention via Implanted Electrodes\nSurface electrodes cannot precisely record the signal from deep muscles; to overcome this issue, several groups have focused on iEMG electrodes. This technique is more invasive but allows one to record EMG signals (51) uncorrelated from the underlying musculature and avoids the daily placement of electrodes. iEMG is robust against electrode shift (e.g., socket rotation) and change in skin impedance and sweat. Several studies have demonstrated the performance of simultaneous wrist and hand motions (three DOFs) using six to eight iEMG electrodes; Smith &amp; Hargrove (51) showed that iEMG has better decoding performance than sEMG. High decoding performance is reported in real time (106), and in fully implanted setups, the results are stable for several days (107).\n\nOnthe other hand, Farrell &amp; Weir (52) compared the pattern recognition-based grasp classification performance of iEMG and sEMG on 12 movement classes with eight channels and did not find a statistical difference between electrode types. They concluded that the choice of electrode should be based not on classification accuracy but rather on signal consistency over time and robustness to electrode lift-off. Zia ur Rehman et al. (108) compared a standard linear discriminant analysis with a deep network for grasp classification. They performed a multiday analysis comparing six iEMG and six sEMG electrodes, and their results showed that deep learning had better decoding performance and was more stable over time.\n\nKamavuako et al. (109) investigated the effect of combining iEMG to target deep muscles with sEMG on myoelectric control. They showed that the combined solution improved offline and real-time control performance compared with sEMG alone.\n\nWith 32 iEMG electrodes, Dantas et al. (110) compared different decoding methods for the continuous control of five DOFs corresponding to the flexion and extension of each digit. Using a data set aggregation algorithm, they showed a normalized mean squared error as low as 0.033 with a deep convolutional neural network. They also investigated signal stability for 150 days after training, showing a small degradation during the first month (0.003 normalized mean squared error per day with a convolutional neural network), but that degradation stopped in the next four months.\n\nFor transradial amputees, an alternative to using EMG signals to control hand prostheses is decoding from peripheral nerve signals. Different grasp types can be decoded from peripheral nerve signals with high accuracy using different interfaces, both offline and in real time (54, 111113). Implanted peripheral nerve recordings are more invasive than sEMG but are more stable over time. Indeed, donning and doffing the prosthesis does not move these electrodes as much as it does sEMG electrodes. Recently, Cracchiolo et al. (53) decoded up to 11 class states using TIMEs on an amputee subject and showed that the active sites chosen on the first day could also be used in the following sessions, for up to seven days (80% accuracy, compared with 83% by selecting active sites every session). However, this modality is generally used to provide sensory\n\nfeedback (64, 114-116). Therefore the development of new approaches to record neural signals during peripheral stimulation [e.g., artifact removal (117)] is necessary.\n\nVu et al. (39) recently developed a regenerative peripheral nerve interface to increase signal specificity and long-term stability. They implanted transected peripheral nerves into a free muscle graft. After regeneration, revascularization, and reinnervation, the graft becomes a nerve bioamplifier that creates EMG signals. Using chronically implanted iEMG to record from these grafts, they performed five-class decoding in real time with up to 98.2% accuracy with two transradial amputees in a virtual hand environment. They also showed results from a Box and Block T est using an RPH that provided continuous control of two DOFs of thumb motions through their interface combined with a third DOF based on sEMG.\n", "topic": "Evaluation of deep learning for grasp classification using iEMG electrodes", "question": "How do the decoding performance and signal stability of iEMG electrodes compare to sEMG electrodes, particularly in terms of robustness against electrode shift and change in skin impedance and sweat?", "choices": {"C": "Deep learning-based decoding methods have been shown to have better performance and stability than traditional machine learning-based methods for grasp classification using iEMG electrodes.", "D": "The use of iEMG electrodes for grasp classification has been limited by the need for extensive signal processing and feature extraction, which can compromise decoding performance and signal stability.", "A": "iEMG electrodes have been shown to have better decoding performance than sEMG electrodes due to their robustness against electrode shift and change in skin impedance and sweat.", "B": "The choice of electrode should be based on signal consistency over time and robustness to electrode lift-off, rather than classification accuracy."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The correct answer is A, as iEMG electrodes have been shown to have better decoding performance than sEMG electrodes due to their robustness against electrode shift and change in skin impedance and sweat.

{"context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "Assessing the Efficacy of Neuroprosthetic Technologies", "question": "What are the primary challenges in developing neuroprosthetic technologies that can seamlessly integrate with users' nervous systems to enable natural control and sensory feedback?", "choices": {"A": "Overcoming the complexity of neural signal processing and decoding motor intentions.", "B": "Designing robust and user-friendly interfaces that minimize learning curves.", "C": "Achieving a balance between dexterity, robustness, and usability in prosthetic hands.", "D": "Developing sensorization strategies that can convey somatosensory feedback in real-time."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is a combination of challenges (A and B), as these are the primary obstacles in developing neuroprosthetic technologies.
