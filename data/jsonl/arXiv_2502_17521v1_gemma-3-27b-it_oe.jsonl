{"context": "### 3 Static Benchmarking\nIn this section, we summarize a collection of static benchmarks that have been widely used to evaluate various aspects of model performance. These benchmarks cover a broad range of tasks including math, language, coding, reasoning, knowledge, safety, instruction following, and reading comprehension. They serve as standardized evaluation tools to measure model abilities in areas such as arithmetic problem-solving, natural language understanding, program synthesis, commonsense reasoning, factual knowledge retrieval, toxicity detection, and more.

{"context": "###### Limitations\nThe quality of LLM-generated samples is often uncertain. For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation. It first extracts reasoning graphs from existing benchmarks and then perturbs them into new samples using predefined rules.\n\nC2LEVA\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2024c) incorporates all three contamination-free construction methods to build a contamination-free bilingual evaluation.\n\n\n### 5 Discussions\nKey Insights.\n\nOur analysis highlights two key insights regarding data contamination in LLM benchmarking. First, static benchmarks become less effective as training corpora grow. The probability of contamination increases with Prcontam\u221d|\ud835\udc9ftrain|\u22c5|\ud835\udc9ftest|\u22121proportional-tosubscriptPrcontam\u22c5subscript\ud835\udc9ftrainsuperscriptsubscript\ud835\udc9ftest1\\text{Pr}\\_{\\text{contam}}\\propto|\\mathcal{D}\\_{\\text{train}}|\\cdot|\\mathcal{D}\\_%\n\n{\\text{test}}|^{-1}Pr start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT contam end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT \u221d | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT train end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | \u22c5 | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT test end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, rendering traditional benchmarks outdated for models trained on web-scale data. Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n", "topic": "How interactive evaluation reliability depends on the performance of the interviewer LLM in generating questions and assigning scores.", "question": "What factor principally determines the reliability of assessments conducted via interactive evaluation of large language models?", "answer": "The performance of the interviewer LLM in generating questions and assigning scores.", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that in interactive evaluation, reliability \"largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\" This highlights the critical role of the LLM acting as the evaluator.", "question_token_count": 18, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 15, "choices": null}

Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.

We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

{"context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.

{"context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string.

In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making.

{"context": "###### Limitations\nThe quality of LLM-generated samples is often uncertain. For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

First, static benchmarks become less effective as training corpora grow.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n", "topic": "The challenges associated with dynamic benchmarks, specifically balancing correctness with scalability and controlling complexity.", "question": "Considering the inherent trade-offs in dynamic benchmark design, how does neglecting complexity control impact the efficiency of LLM evaluation?", "answer": "Neglecting complexity control leads to inefficiencies in LLM evaluation.", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that some dynamic benchmarks \"neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\" This highlights a direct link between complexity and evaluation efficiency.", "question_token_count": 23, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 14, "choices": null}
