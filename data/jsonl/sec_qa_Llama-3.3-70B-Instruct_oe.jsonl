{"context": "## 1.6. Tools of the Trade {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tools_of_the_trade}\nWith all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the question remains, \\\"What can be done?\\\" There\n\nare a few tools the security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture including: *user\n\nawareness*, *anti-malware software*, *backups*, and *encryption*.\n\n::: description-list\n\n[User Awareness]{.term}\n\n:   [A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform\n\n    other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure. While a backup does not solve the problem of the data being\n\n    sold or used by others, it does allow for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a security\n\n    plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Encryption]{.term}\n\n:   [At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to make it useful. Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key. Often,\n\n    encryption and backups complement each other and fill in the use cases that each lacks individually. As such,\n\n    encryption will show up multiple times and in multiple ways in an average security plan.]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.7.

{"context": "## 6.1. False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine.

It has proven to be very scalable and is commonly\n\ndeployed in the enterprise environment (corporations, universities, schools, etc.)\n\nActive Directory relies upon the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for its communications.

LDAP is often used by internal applications and process.\n\nThe cornerstone of an AD environment is the Domain Controller (DC). DCs stores directory information about Users,\n\nGroups, Computers, Policies, and more. They respond to auth requests for the domain (network) they are supporting. A\n\nstandard network will have multiple DCs with fail-over in place in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor many environments, AD is the mechanism used for authentication, authorization, and accounting. As many services have\n\nmigrated to the web, the need to access AD from anywhere has become increasingly important.

When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range).

A protocol may include information about the syntax\n\nused, error correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication occurs in the context of that\n\nsituation. In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses\n\noften determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed\n\nvia individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for\n\nComments (RFCs). You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. [Some of the earliest web\n\nprotocols are detailed in RFCs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616){.link} More often than not, large\n\nprotocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the [Institute of Electrical and\n\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/){.link} which handles WiFi protocols. These groups publish papers\n\ndetailing how the protocols work.\n\nThis chapter will give a brief description of important protocols following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important\n\nto note that some of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks. In this case they will be grouped\n\naccording to which layer they largely function within.\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"4.1.

Business Continuity {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__business_continuity}\nThe concept of continuity is central to the steps taken to respond to an incident.

Business Continuity has three main parts: Business Continuity Planning\n\n(BCP), Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP).\n\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) is a methodology for keeping things running. With BCP threats are identified in\n\nadvance and critical business processes are prioritized. Recovery procedures for these processes have been developed and\n\ntested. In response to an incident, these procedures are followed as practiced.\n\nBusiness Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies business functions and rates the impact of an outage on these functions. BIA\n\nmeasures the impact of an outage on:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Property (tangible assets)]{.principal}\n\n- [Finance (monetary funding)]{.principal}\n\n- [Safety (physical protection)]{.principal}\n\n- [Reputation (status)]{.principal}\n\n- [Life (well being)]{.principal}\n\n- [Customers]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nBIA can help pinpoint mission-essential functions and single points of failure. This allows SOCs to determine where\n\nthere resources should go in terms of having the best chance of maintaining business continuity.\n\nFinally having a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) makes it easier to recover in the case of a large-scale issue. Disaster\n\nRecovery (DR) entails policies, tools, and procedures to recover from an outage.

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT). By utilizing the resources of a nation (often including its\n\nintelligence and military resources) APTs are a severe threat.\n\n:::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.5.

Web-based Attacks {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__web_based_attacks}\nThe world wide web and the protocols/formats/languages it uses (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc.) were *not* originally\n\ndesigned with security in mind.

{"context": "### 7.3.9. Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.  [User accesses a sevice]{.principal}\n\n2.  [User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request]{.principal}\n\n3.  [User logs in]{.principal}\n\n4.  [Credentials are verified]{.principal}\n\n5.  [SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one.

A typical\n\nattack involves eavesdropping and possibly modifying messages between two parties.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own.

Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

An\n\nIDS (Intrusion Detection System) may flag the queries as known SQL injection attacks. Assuming the attack makes it past\n\nthe application, team, and the IDS, it is possible that the database user is configured according to the principle of\n\nleast privilege and the queries will not be executed due to a lack of permissions.\n\nAs you can see, any one of these layers may be fail, but by having multiple layers the chance of an attack occurring is\n\ngreatly diminished.\n\n:::\n\n:::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.3.

A protocol may include information about the syntax\n\nused, error correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication occurs in the context of that\n\nsituation. In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses\n\noften determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed\n\nvia individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for\n\nComments (RFCs). You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. [Some of the earliest web\n\nprotocols are detailed in RFCs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616){.link} More often than not, large\n\nprotocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the [Institute of Electrical and\n\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/){.link} which handles WiFi protocols. These groups publish papers\n\ndetailing how the protocols work.\n\nThis chapter will give a brief description of important protocols following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important\n\nto note that some of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks. In this case they will be grouped\n\naccording to which layer they largely function within.\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"4.1.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message.
