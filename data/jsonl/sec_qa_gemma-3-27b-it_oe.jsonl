Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering.

When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes.

Lab: Linux File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_linux_file_permissions}\nIn this lab we are going to explore UNIX style file permissions and determine what they can do and why they are limited.\n\nFinally we will see how Linux ACLs provide more flexibility in assigning permissions.\n\nWe will be working in a vanilla Ubuntu container and installing software and adding users manually. Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n", "topic": "Explain how to use the `getfacl` command to view the ACLs associated with a file or directory.", "question": "Describe how the `getfacl` command is utilized to examine the Access Control Lists (ACLs) applied to a file or directory and what information it reveals.", "answer": "`getfacl` displays the owner, group, and any additional access entries with their associated permissions for a file or directory.", "explanation": "The `getfacl` command displays the full set of ACLs for a specified file or directory, including the owner, group, and any additional access entries defined for specific users or groups.

Isolation and Containment {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__isolation_and_containment}\nThe first step in reaction to an incident is to remove the asset from the network so that the damage does not spread.

Breached accounts are also disabled.\n\nUnfortunately it may be impossible to roll back some assets to a previously uncompromised state, in which case they may\n\nneed to be restored from a backup or failing that rebuilt from the ground up. Backups make recovery much simpler and\n\ncompanies that do not have a backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That being said, malware\n\nmay have also found its way into the backups if given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically\n\ndestroyed and a new one is built.

Symmetric Encryption {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__symmetric_encryption}\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/symmetric.svg\" width=\"550\" alt=\"symmetric\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSymmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand in that it only uses a single key (in this case\n\nour key is labelled \\'A\\') to encrypt or decrypt data. Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7.

Unfortunately if the input data doesn't fit neatly into\n\nblocks of the same size, padding may be required, which takes up more space/memory and reduces the speed of the cipher.\n\nAs such the block encryption is often less performant than stream encryption.\n\n:::::::::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"2.9.1. Block Cipher Modes of Operation\"}\n", "topic": "Describe the potential drawbacks of using block ciphers when the input data is not a multiple of the block size.", "question": "How does the necessity of padding impact the efficiency of block cipher operations when processing data that is not an exact multiple of the cipher's block size?", "answer": "Padding increases space/memory usage and reduces cipher speed.", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that padding \"takes up more space/memory and reduces the speed of the cipher,\" directly addressing the impact on efficiency.", "question_token_count": 30, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 11, "choices": null}

Symmetric Encryption {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__symmetric_encryption}\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/symmetric.svg\" width=\"550\" alt=\"symmetric\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSymmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand in that it only uses a single key (in this case\n\nour key is labelled \\'A\\') to encrypt or decrypt data. Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7.

Security Plans {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__security_plans}\nWhile confronting such a diverse array of actors can seem daunting at first, the key element to being successful is\n\nhaving a plan.

{"context": "### 4.4.14. FTP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ftp}\nFile Transfer Protocol is a relatively simple, text-based protocol for sending files between machines. FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

{"context": "### 7.2.3. Key Cards {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__key_cards}\nMany security measures employ key cards for access to rooms. A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard.

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself.

Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n", "topic": "What are the limitations of traditional UNIX file permissions, and why might they be insufficient for modern security requirements?", "question": "Describe a scenario where traditional UNIX file permissions would be inadequate for secure access control, and explain why the inherent limitations of this system necessitate a more granular solution.", "answer": "Traditional UNIX permissions are inadequate when specific services need access to individual user data without exposing it to other users or services; the system's reliance on broad user/group/other categories lacks the granularity to provide targeted access, necessitating solutions like Linux ACLs.", "explanation": "The text explicitly details how traditional UNIX permissions lack the granularity needed when a service (like a web server) requires access to specific user directories without granting broader access to others.

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\".

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*.

In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings.

{"context": "## 1.2. Learning the Lingo {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__learning_the_lingo}\nIn general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary. Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

{"context": "### 7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}\nThere are several different authorization models that can be used. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles.

Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host\n\nto have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and typically support a commonly used\n\nservice. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them. Lastly ports 49152 to 65535\n\nare used dynamically by applications as needed.\n\nIt is important to know some commonly used ports as the services running on these ports may be subject to an

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

{"context": "### 7.3.10. Kerberos {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__kerberos}\nKerberos is an authentication protocol for client server connections. It was developed by MIT in the 1980s and is most\n\nlargely deployed on Windows networks, but many Linux distributions support using it for authentication as well. Kerberos\n\nmakes extensive use of time-based tickets and as such all client participating must have their clocks in sync.
