Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data.

Business Continuity {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__business_continuity}\nThe concept of continuity is central to the steps taken to respond to an incident. Remember that the goal is to keep\n\nthings running and keep services available. Business Continuity has three main parts: Business Continuity Planning\n\n(BCP), Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP).\n\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) is a methodology for keeping things running. With BCP threats are identified in\n\nadvance and critical business processes are prioritized. Recovery procedures for these processes have been developed and\n\ntested. In response to an incident, these procedures are followed as practiced.\n\nBusiness Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies business functions and rates the impact of an outage on these functions. BIA\n\nmeasures the impact of an outage on:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Property (tangible assets)]{.principal}\n\n- [Finance (monetary funding)]{.principal}\n\n- [Safety (physical protection)]{.principal}\n\n- [Reputation (status)]{.principal}\n\n- [Life (well being)]{.principal}\n\n- [Customers]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nBIA can help pinpoint mission-essential functions and single points of failure. This allows SOCs to determine where\n\nthere resources should go in terms of having the best chance of maintaining business continuity.\n\nFinally having a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) makes it easier to recover in the case of a large-scale issue. Disaster\n\nRecovery (DR) entails policies, tools, and procedures to recover from an outage. DRPs will detail order of restoration\n\nand require a lot of testing to ensure that the entire suite of supported applications can be brought back up.

Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself.

For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n", "topic": "Applying Specific Permissions to Multiple Directories Using `setfacl`", "question": "Given the scenario where you need to grant read and execute permissions to the `http` user for multiple directories (`alice`, `bob`, and `carol`) using `setfacl`, explain the steps necessary to achieve this and provide the exact `setfacl` command you would use.

{"context": "### 9.4.3. Isolation and Containment {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__isolation_and_containment}\nThe first step in reaction to an incident is to remove the asset from the network so that the damage does not spread. It\n\nis standard procedure for malware to attempt to spread to other machines and the fastest way for it to do that is\n\nthrough an internal network. By isolating the infected asset, we can help prevent this.\n\nThere are a few other tools for containing malware such as sandboxing and snapshots. Sandboxing refers to the practice\n\nof running processes in a controlled environment on a machine. Most web browsers sandbox the JavaScript they run,\n\nmeaning that if a website is serving malicious JS it should not be able to affect anything else on the machine.\n\nSnapshots refer to periodically saving the state of the storage device on a machine.

Recovery {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__recovery}\nRecovery can be a long process, but it is the core of responding to an incident. If it is possible to remove malware\n\nfrom a machine, that action is taken in this step. Breached accounts are also disabled.\n\nUnfortunately it may be impossible to roll back some assets to a previously uncompromised state, in which case they may\n\nneed to be restored from a backup or failing that rebuilt from the ground up. Backups make recovery much simpler and\n\ncompanies that do not have a backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That being said, malware\n\nmay have also found its way into the backups if given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically\n\ndestroyed and a new one is built. While this can take a long time, it is one of the few ways to know for sure that the\n\nasset isn't compromised.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"9.4.5.

There is often a lot of overlap between solutions and while that may seem inefficient in other fields,\n\nin cybersecurity we consider it a benefit. By using multiple solutions, sometimes referred to as multi-layered security\n\nor defense in depth, you can build a more robust protection against breaches.\n\nLet's take a look at an example to see how layered security can help mitigate the effects of a real-world attack. Assume\n\nan SOC is supporting a web application on self-hosted machines. A malicious actor wishes to exfiltrate data from the web\n\napplication.

Kerberos\n\nmakes extensive use of time-based tickets and as such all client participating must have their clocks in sync. When\n\nfunctioning correctly, Kerberos allows for full authentication on an untrusted network.\n\nKerberos makes use of many different services and concepts to perform its duties.

{"context": "## 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed. These tables may take up terabytes of disk space, but can make cracking even complicated hashes much simpler.\n\n<p>\n\nLet's use a custom utility named\n\n<code class=\"literal\">\n\n[\\`crypt`</code>`{=html}](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/blob/main/labs/hash/crypt.c){.link} to show that we have the\n\nactual password.

{"context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1.

Asymmetric Encryption {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__asymmetric_encryption}\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/asymmetric.svg\" width=\"700\" alt=\"asymmetric\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nAn asymmetric encryption algorithm has actually already been demonstrated in the [Mathematical\n\nFoundation](#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mathematical_foundation){#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml_xref-_mathematical_foundation\n\n.xref} section. Asymmetric encryption has a public key which can be published anywhere and used to encrypt messages that\n\nonly the holder of the private key, which is not published, can unencrypt. For example if you want to receive encrypted\n\nemails you may make your [GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)](https://gnupg.org/){.link} public key available a [public key\n\nserver](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/){.link}. This would allow anyone to look up your public key, encrypt a message\n\nthat only you can read, and send you the ciphertext. Asymmetric encryption gets around the difficulties of key exchange\n\nvia an untrusted channel (like email). Unfortunately the cost of such a useful system is that asymmetric algorithms tend\n\nto be much slower that their symmetric counterparts.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.8.

An attacker who intercepts the public key or substitutes their own can use it to encrypt messages intended for the legitimate recipient, leading to potential decryption by the attacker.

{"context": "## 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed.

That is a process that is hard to compute\n\nin one direction, but easy to compute in the other. For example it is much easier for a computer to multiply large\n\nnumbers than to determine the factors of large numbers. This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm.

At no point do you ever have to factor a large prime number to generate keys, encrypt, or decrypt.\n\nYou only have to perform that operation if you're trying to work backwards without the keys.\n\nOther similar one-way function exist based on elliptical curves. It turns out that motion along an elliptical curve can\n\nbe described according to a start and end point and several iterations of a simple algorithm. You can reconstruct the\n\ninitial conditions if you know the start point, end point, and how many iterations it took.

ICMP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__icmp}\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is largely used to send messages between systems when IP doesn't work. For\n\nexample, lets say we tried to connect to a host but our router doesn't know how to get there. Our router can send us an\n\nICMP *Destination Unreachable* message to let us know that something is going wrong. Because ICMP messages work at the\n\nnetwork layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue with the internet layer.\n\nThe most common use for ICMP is the `ping`{.literal} command. `ping`{.literal} sends an ICMP echo request to check to\n\nsee if a host is up. By responding to the request with the data included in the request we can assume that the host is\n\nup and functioning.\n\nICMP is also used in the `traceroute`{.literal} command. `traceroute`{.literal} incrementally increase the Time To Live\n\n(TTL) field of ICMP packets and watches for *TTL Exceeded* messages to determine what route packets are taking to get to\n\na host.

Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7.
