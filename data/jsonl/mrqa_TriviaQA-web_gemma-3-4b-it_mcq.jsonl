{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Pandoras Box Greek Mythology - mlahanas.dePandora [PAR] Pandora [PAR] The creation of Pandora; interior of a Cylix (470/ 460 B.C.) [PAR] In Greek mythology, Pandora (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1)(\"all gifted\") was the first woman, fashioned by Zeus as part of the punishment of mankind for Prometheus ' theft of the secret of fire. [PAR] Hesiod , in his Works and Days, ca. 700 BC, has a very early version of the Pandora story. [ 1 ] [PAR] Creation of Pandora: Zeus, Hermes, Epimetheus and Pandora [PAR] The legend [PAR] The titan Epimetheus (\"hindsight\") was responsible for giving a positive trait to each and every animal. However, when it was time to give man a positive trait, there was nothing left. Prometheus (\"foresight\"), his brother, felt that because man was superior to all other animals, man should have a gift no other animal possessed. So Prometheus set forth to steal fire from Zeus and handed it over to man. [PAR] Zeus was enraged and decided to punish Prometheus and his creation: mankind. To punish Prometheus, Zeus chained him in unbreakable fetters and set an eagle over him to eat his liver each day, as the eagle is Zeus' sacred animal. Prometheus was an immortal, so the liver grew back every day, but he was still tormented daily from the pain, until he was freed by Heracles during The Twelve Labours. [PAR] To punish mankind, Zeus ordered the other gods to make Pandora as a poisoned gift for man. Pandora was given several traits from the different gods: Hephaestus molded her out of clay and gave her form; Athena clothed her and adorned her with necklaces made by Hephaestus as well as taught her manual dexterity and how to spin; Aphrodite gave her beauty; Apollo gave her musical talent and a gift for healing; Demeter taught her to tend a garden; Poseidon gave her a pearl necklace and the ability to never drown; Zeus made her idle, mischievous, and foolish; Hera gave her curiosity; Hermes, along with giving her cunning, boldness and charm, then gave Pandora a box. The name Pandora, thus, derives from the fact she's received gifts from all deities: \"all gifts\". [PAR] Pandora Vase [PAR] Before he was chained to the rock, Prometheus had warned Epimetheus not to take any gifts from the gods. Epimetheus did not listen to his brother, however, and when Pandora arrived, he fell in love with her. Hermes told him that Pandora was a gift to the titan from Zeus, and he warned Epimetheus to not open the box, which was Pandora's dowry. [PAR] Until then, mankind had lived a life in a paradise without worry. Epimetheus told Pandora never to open the box she had received from Zeus. However, one day, Pandora's curiosity got the better of her and she opened it, releasing all the misfortunes of mankind (plague, sorrow, poverty, crime, etc.). Once opened, she shut it in time to keep one thing in the box: hope 1. The world remained extremely bleak for an unspecified interval, until Pandora \"chanced\" to revisit the box again, at which point Hope fluttered out. Thus, mankind always has hope in times of evil, but Hope has a great deal of catching up to do. (See also Garden of Eden.) [PAR] The daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora was Pyrrha , who married Deucalion and was one of the two who survived the deluge. [PAR] Epimetheus and Pandora, El Greco [PAR] Commentary [PAR] The story of Pandora's Box can be interpreted in more than one way, but one obvious moral is that of \"curiosity killed the cat\". [PAR] Some scholars 2 contend that Pandora's \"box\" may have been a mistranslation, and her \"box\" may have been a large jar or vase, forged from the earth. In fact, there is evidence 3 that suggests Pandora herself was the jar. In Ancient Greece jars commonly bore images of women. The jar was said 4 to have been in a jar form because of the similarites between a jar and a woman's uterus.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Shipping ForecastThe Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the British Isles.  It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW.

[PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.

Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.

The story and emotional content of a musical\u00a0\u2013 humor, pathos, love, anger\u00a0\u2013 are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals. [PAR] Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America.  These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma!

[PAR] Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America. [PAR] Definitions and scope  [PAR] Book musicals [PAR] Since the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.   The three main components of a book musical are its music, lyrics and book. The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development, and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the libretto (Italian for \u201clittle book\u201d). The music and lyrics together form the score of a musical and includes songs; incidental music; and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\" The interpretation of a musical by is influenced by its creative team, which includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound, which generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some famous production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in Chicago. [PAR] There is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short intermission and the first act frequently longer than the second.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  [PAR] In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Lord Peter WimseyLord Peter Death  Bredon Wimsey is the fictional protagonist in a series of detective novels and short stories by Dorothy L. Sayers (and their continuation by Jill Paton Walsh) in which he solves mysteries\u2014usually murders. A dilettante who solves mysteries for his own amusement, Wimsey is an archetype for the British gentleman detective. Lord Peter is often assisted by his valet and former batman Mervyn Bunter, his good friend and later brother-in-law  Inspector/Chief Inspector Charles \"Parker Bird\" Parker, and later by his future wife Harriet Vane. [PAR] Born in the year 1890 and aging in real time, Wimsey is described as being of average height, with straw-coloured hair, a beaked nose, and a vaguely foolish face. Reputedly his looks were patterned after those of academic and poet Roy Ridley, whom Sayers briefly met in a relationship after witnessing him read his Newdigate Prize-winning poem \"Oxford\" at the Encaenia ceremony in July 1913. He also possessed considerable intelligence and athletic ability, evidenced by his playing cricket for Oxford University while earning a First. He created a spectacularly successful publicity campaign for Whifflet cigarettes while working for Pym's Publicity Ltd, and at age 40 was able to turn three cartwheels in the office corridor, stopping just short of the boss's open office door (Murder Must Advertise). [PAR] Among Lord Peter's hobbies, in addition to criminology, is collecting incunabula, books from the earliest days of printing. He is an expert on matters of food (especially wine), male fashion, and classical music. He excels at the piano, including Bach's works for keyboard instruments. One of Lord Peter's cars is a 12-cylinder (\"double-six\") 1927 Daimler four-seater, which (like all his cars) he calls \"Mrs Merdle\" after a character in Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit who \"hated fuss\". [PAR] Biography [PAR] Background [PAR] Lord Peter Wimsey's (fictional) ancestry begins with the 12th-century knight Gerald de Wimsey, who went with King Richard The Lion Heart on the Third Crusade and took part in the Siege of Acre.  This makes the Wimseys an unusually ancient family, since \"Very few English noble families go that far in the first creation; rebellions and monarchic head choppings had seen to that\" (as reviewer Janet Hitchman noted in the introduction to Striding Folly). The family coat of arms is blazoned as \"Sable, 3 mice courant, argent; crest, a domestic cat couched as to spring, proper\". The family motto, displayed under its coat of arms, is \"As my Whimsy takes me.\"  [PAR] Early life [PAR] Lord Peter was the second of the three children of Mortimer Wimsey, 15th Duke of Denver, and Honoria Lucasta Delagardie, who lives on throughout the novels as the Dowager Duchess of Denver. The Dowager Duchess is witty and intelligent, and strongly supports her younger son, whom she plainly prefers over his less intelligent, more conventional older brother, Gerald, the 16th Duke. Gerald's snobbish wife, Helen, who detests Wimsey, and their devil-may-care heir, Viscount St. George (Wimsey's nephew, who likes him), also make appearances in the novels. So does Lady Mary, the younger sister of the Duke and Lord Peter, who  leans strongly to the political left and scandalizes her family by marrying a policeman of working class origins. [PAR] Lord Peter Wimsey is called \"Lord\" by courtesy as the son of a Duke. He is not a peer and has no right to sit in the House of Lords, nor does this courtesy usage pass on to any offspring he may have. [PAR] As a boy, the young Peter Wimsey was, to the great distress of his father, strongly attached to an old, smelly poacher living at the edge of the family estate.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity.

There are no age or citizenship restrictions on the position of prime minister itself. [PAR] While there is no legal requirement for the prime minister to be a member of parliament, for practical and political reasons the prime minister is expected to win a seat very promptly.  However, in rare circumstances individuals who are not sitting members of the House of Commons have been appointed to the position of prime minister. Two former prime ministers\u2014Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell\u2014served in the 1890s while members of the Senate. Both, in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate, succeeded prime ministers who had died in office\u2014John A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894. That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario. [PAR] Prime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible.  For example, William Lyon Mackenzie King, after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election (that his party won), briefly \"governed from the hallway\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power. Turner was the last sitting prime minister to not hold a commons seat. [PAR] Should a sitting prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature, or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat, the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by-election. A safe seat is usually chosen; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party's new leader in the by-election, the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention.

That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The exact distance to Deneb is unclear, with estimates ranging from about 1,425 light-years to perhaps as much as 7,000 light-years. Whatever its exact distance, when you gaze at Deneb, know that you are gazing across thousands of light-years of space. [PAR] The best estimates for Deneb\u2019s distance likely are those obtained by the Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission in the 1990s. A simple calculation from initial Hipparcos data gives the figure of 3,230 light-years, whereas the refined data yield just over 1,400 light-years. At any of these estimates distances, Deneb is one of the farthest stars the unaided human eye can see. It is so far, that the light that reaches the Earth today started on its journey well more than 1,000 years ago. [PAR] Deneb (bottom half of frame) is 200 times bigger than the sun. Image via AstroBob [PAR] In order for us to see it at its enormous distance, Deneb must also be tremendously bright and energetic. Among the 20 brightest stars, only Rigel in Orion surpasses Deneb in intrinsic brightness. Deneb is an A2Ia star, which says that it is white hot (A2) and a supergiant star (Ia). Prof. James Kaler, using the figure of 2,600 light years as the distance, estimated a diameter 200 times greater than our sun, and about a quarter of a million times brighter in visible light. Considering its spectral classification (A2), Deneb must have a surface temperature between about 8500 to 9000 kelvins (roughly 14,800 to 15,700 degrees F).

But Deneb may well be the most energetic (based on the amount of electromagnetic radiation it produces) of the A-type stars. The famed North American nebula, a large cloud of glowing gas in the shape of the continent, likely is glowing in a process similar to fluorescence, energized by the radiation of Deneb.

You can gaze at this faraway star starting in late spring, when Deneb rises over the northeastern horizon by mid-evening. A month later, Deneb is already in the sky by the time it gets dark. In standard time, the midnight culmination date is about August 1. Using Daylight Time, the midnight culmination is about August 15. The word \u2018culmination\u2019 indicates the star\u2019s highest point in the sky. [PAR] Deneb is part of several famous star patterns, which overlap each other.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Artwork highlights - Bubbles, by Sir John Everett MillaisArtwork details, Liverpool museums [PAR] See a larger version [PAR] About the artwork [PAR] One of the most famous paintings by the Victorian artist Sir John Millais has been placed on long loan at the Lady Lever Art Gallery. It has been lent by Unilever. [PAR] 'Bubbles' was painted in 1885-6. It shows a boy blowing bubbles with a pipe and a bowl of soap suds. The boy was the artist\u2019s grandson, Willie James, aged about four: he later became an Admiral. To get round the problems of painting the bubbles, the artist had a glass sphere specially manufactured. Millais originally titled his painting 'A Child\u2019s World' but it was later changed to 'Bubbles'. [PAR] As a young man, Millais was one of the chief artists in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , which set out to attack the complacency of the Royal Academy. He painted masterpieces such as 'Isabella' ( Walker Art Gallery ) and ' Ophelia ' ( Tate Britain ) in a new style with bright colours, wiry outlines and minute detail. By the time he painted 'Bubbles', Millais was in his 50s. He had abandoned the Pre-Raphaelite style and had adopted darker colours and looser brushwork.\u00a0 No longer a rebel, he had joined the Royal Academy and had become a pillar of the art establishment. Much of his work at this stage in his career featured sentimental portrayals of small children. Other examples, at the Lady Lever Art Gallery, are 'Little Speedwell\u2019s Darling Blue' and 'The Nest'. [PAR] Although 'Bubbles' may appear sentimental to modern taste, it has a serious meaning. Millais was using a symbol with a long tradition behind it. 'Bubbles' are fragile and have a brief moment of beauty before they burst. In the 17th century Dutch artists painted children blowing bubbles to convey the brevity of human life, the transience of beauty and the inevitability of death. This theme appealed to Millais and is a key to several other of his paintings, such as ' Spring (Apple Blossoms) ' also at the Lady Lever Art Gallery. Amongst the beauty of the young girls and the spring flowers in this picture, Millais painted a scythe, to indicate that beauty fades and that death awaits us all. [PAR] This aspect of 'Bubbles' was not obvious to the Victorians. Victorian artists associated childhood with sweetness and innocence. The attitude is seen in the book illustrations of Kate Greenaway and in historical pictures such as 'And when did you last see your father?' by\u00a0 W. F. Yeames (Walker Art Gallery). It had also been seen in the 18th century in pictures like ' The Age of Innocence ' (Tate Britain) by Sir Joshua Reynolds , who was much admired by Millais. The interpretation of childhood changed radically after Freud wrote about it as a troubled period of latent sexuality, but it would be unhistorical to expect Millais to reflect these ideas in his work. [PAR] Listen to a recording of Julian Treuherz's gallery talk on 'Bubbles' online now . [PAR] The painting was brought from Millais by Sir William Ingram, proprietor of the Illustrated London News, a popular magazine with a wide circulation. Ingram also bought the copyright from the artist. He published 'Bubbles' as a special presentation colour print with the Christmas number of the magazine in 1887. (Other paintings of children by Millais had been published with previous Christmas numbers with great success.) [PAR] Before its appearance in the magazine, the painting with its copyright was sold to A & F Pears, manufacturers of Pears soap. The Managing Director of Pears, Thomas Barrett, was a pioneer of modern advertising methods, and he and William Lever of Lever Brothers, makers of Sunlight Soap, were great rivals, each spending vast sums on promoting their brands. [PAR] Barrett turned 'Bubbles' into an advertisement by adding a bar of soap in the foreground. Millais was furious, but he could do nothing about it.

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for males, and this section will discuss the 4 main types of male voices, their respective pitch ranges, unique tonal characteristics, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One important point to note: These 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type \u2013 are not to be confused with each other. [PAR] The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that our voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas the Type of Voice refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to understand more about how to find your own vocal range, as well as how to determine your own voice type using the various criteria! [PAR] Now, the 4 main types of male voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Countertenor [PAR] Let us look at each of these male voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. COUNTERTENOR [PAR] The Countertenor Voice may actually be unfamiliar to those of us not from the classical realm, as many of us would probably only have heard of the 3 main male voices \u2013 Tenor, Baritone and Bass. [PAR] The Countertenor voice is the highest of the adult male voice types, and has a vocal range that is similar to that of the Female Contralto Voice, the lowest of the female voice types! In the Mandarin pop scene, certain singers like Jeff Chang and the lead singer of popular pop rock band Soda Green would probably qualify as countertenor voices! [PAR] An approximate Countertenor Vocal Range would be from a G note below the middle C (G3) to a high F one octave above the middle C (F5). Be sure to support your voice well with your breath so as to get a more accurate representation of the range in your voice. Check out the section on \u2018How to Find Your Singing Range and Voice Type\u2019 to get some tips on finding your range on your own! [PAR] Also, the Tessitura or most comfortable singing range for Countertenors lies above that of the Tenor and other adult male voices. The Countertenor voice would usually be able to sing the high head voice notes with great ease and brightness in tone, and would often be confused by many listeners with regular female voices. [PAR] 2. TENOR [PAR] The Tenor Voice is the highest of the main male vocal types that most people would be familiar with, with the typical tenor vocal range lying between the C note one octave below middle C (C3) to the C note one octave above middle C (C5)! This means that it would lie just slightly below the Countertenor voice, but has similar characteristics in the sense that the Tenor would also be able to sing most high notes with ease and vocalize the head voice notes with strength and brightness! [PAR] The Tenor voice would probably transition into his middle voice around the D or E note above middle C (D4 or E4) and shift into head voice around the F sharp or G above middle C (F4 or G4). The tenor tessitura would lie between that of the Countertenor\u2019s and the Baritone\u2019s. Do make sure that we avoid certain common singing problems like jaw tightness when we attempt to find out where our vocal register transitions lie, as this will affect the notes at which we transition, affecting the voice type we may classify ourselves to be! [PAR] Famous Tenor voices include the 3 Tenors \u2013 Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as well as other classical singers like Enrico Caruso and pop singers like Elton John, Stevie Wonder. In the Mandarin pop scene, JJ Lin Junjie and Jay Chou would probably be considered Tenor voices too! [PAR] 3.

Together with then-US President George W. Bush, he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq, an act which remains highly controversial.   [PAR] From 1983 to 2007, Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under Blair's leadership, the party used the phrase \"New Labour\", to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism. Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity.  Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism.  [PAR] In May 1997, the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory, the largest in its history, allowing Blair, at 43 years old, to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In September 1997, Blair attained early personal popularity, receiving a 93% public approval rating, after his public response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.    The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership: in 2001, in which it won another landslide victory, and in 2005, with a reduced majority. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act, and Freedom of Information Act. Blair's government also carried out the devolution, the establishing of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto. In Northern Ireland, Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. [PAR] Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration, and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and, more controversially, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq, including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression.  In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary. [PAR] Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007, and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown.  On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East, which he held until 27 May 2015. He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name, including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.  [PAR] Early life [PAR] Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland,  on 6 May 1953,   the second son of Leo and Hazel ( Corscadden) Blair. Leo Blair, the illegitimate  son of two English actors, had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife, Mary. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and later died in) Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1923, where his wife, Sarah Margaret (n\u00e9e Lipsett), gave birth to Blair's mother, Hazel, above the family's grocery shop.  [PAR] Blair has one elder brother, Sir William Blair, a High Court judge, and a younger sister, Sarah.

Nokia builds bridges between people--both when they are far apart and face-to-face--and also bridges the gap between people and the information they need. [PAR] History of Nokia Corporation [PAR] Nokia Corporation is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, serving customers in 130 countries. Nokia is divided into four business groups: Mobile Phones, Multimedia, Enterprise Solutions, and Networks. The Mobile Phones group markets wireless voice and data products in consumer and corporate markets. The Multimedia segment sells mobile gaming devices, home satellite systems, and cable television set-top boxes. The Enterprise Solutions group develops wireless systems for use in the corporate sector. Wireless switching and transmission equipment is sold through the company's Networks division. Nokia operates 15 manufacturing facilities in nine countries and maintains research and development facilities in 12 countries. [PAR] 19th-Century Origins [PAR] Originally a manufacturer of pulp and paper, Nokia was founded as Nokia Company in 1865 in a small town of the same name in central Finland. Nokia was a pioneer in the industry and introduced many new production methods to a country with only one major natural resource, its vast forests. As the industry became increasingly energy-intensive, the company even constructed its own power plants. But for many years, Nokia remained an important yet static firm in a relatively forgotten corner of northern Europe. Nokia shares were first listed on the Helsinki exchange in 1915. [PAR] The first major changes in Nokia occurred several years after World War II. Despite its proximity to the Soviet Union, Finland has always remained economically connected with Scandinavian and other Western countries, and as Finnish trade expanded Nokia became a leading exporter. [PAR] During the early 1960s Nokia began to diversify in an attempt to transform the company into a regional conglomerate with interests beyond Finnish borders. Unable to initiate strong internal growth, Nokia turned its attention to acquisitions. The government, however, hoping to rationalize two underperforming basic industries, favored Nokia's expansion within the country and encouraged its eventual merger with Finnish Rubber Works, which was founded in 1898, and Finnish Cable Works, which was formed in 1912, to form Nokia Corporation. When the amalgamation was completed in 1966, Nokia was involved in several new industries, including integrated cable operations, electronics, tires, and rubber footwear, and had made its first public share offering. [PAR] In 1967 Nokia set up a division to develop design and manufacturing capabilities in data processing, industrial automation, and communications systems. The division was later expanded and made into several divisions, which then concentrated on developing information systems, including personal computers and workstations, digital communications systems, and mobile phones. Nokia also gained a strong position in modems and automatic banking systems in Scandinavia. [PAR] Oil Crisis, Corporate Changes: 1970s [PAR] Nokia continued to operate in a stable but parochial manner until 1973, when it was affected in a unique way by the oil crisis. Years of political accommodation between Finland and the Soviet Union ensured Finnish neutrality in exchange for lucrative trade agreements with the Soviets, mainly Finnish lumber products and machinery in exchange for Soviet oil. By agreement, this trade was kept strictly in balance. But when world oil prices began to rise, the market price for Soviet oil rose with it. Balanced trade began to mean greatly reduced purchasing power for Finnish companies such as Nokia. [PAR] Although the effects were not catastrophic, the oil crisis did force Nokia to reassess its reliance on Soviet trade (about 12 percent of sales) as well as its international growth strategies. Several contingency plans were drawn up, but the greatest changes came after the company appointed a new CEO, Kari Kairamo, in 1975. [PAR] Kairamo noted the obvious: Nokia was too big for Finland.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Henry III of EnglandHenry III (1 October 1207\u00a0\u2013 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death.  The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. [PAR] Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. [PAR] By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX of France recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. [PAR] In 1263 one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised. [PAR] Background and childhood [PAR] Henry was born in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207.

Dickens and his illustrator Hablot Browne        (phiz) traveled incognito to Yorkshire on a fact-finding mission in        January 1838. There they encountered William Shaw, headmaster of Bowes Academy,        in whose school several boys had died or went blind from mistreatment and        neglect. [PAR] Visiting a cemetery in the area Dickens found the graves of many of the        students of these schools and one in particular Dickens said \"put Smike        into my head\". Smike was the abused inmate of Dotheboys Hall, the fictional        school he based on Shaw's Bowes Academy in Nicholas Nickleby.

In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice.

He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon\u2019s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 1799, during Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt, a French soldier named Pierre Francois Bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the Rosetta Stone. This artifact provided the key to cracking the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years. [PAR] As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. [PAR] In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. [PAR] In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general. [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Rise to Power [PAR] Since 1792, France\u2019s revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various European nations. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria, one of his country\u2019s primary rivals, in a series of battles in Italy. In 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French. [PAR] The following year, the Directory, the five-person group that had governed France since 1795, offered to let Napoleon lead an invasion of England. Napoleon determined that France\u2019s naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior British Royal Navy. Instead, he proposed an invasion of Egypt in an effort to wipe out British trade routes with India. Napoleon\u2019s troops scored a victory against Egypt\u2019s military rulers, the Mamluks, at the Battle of the Pyramids in July 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the British at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. In early 1799, Napoleon\u2019s army launched an invasion of Ottoman-ruled Syria, which ended with the failed siege of Acre, located in modern-day Israel. That summer, with the political situation in France marked by uncertainty, the ever-ambitious and cunning Napoleon opted to abandon his army in Egypt and return to France.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Scotland during the Roman EmpireScotland during the Roman Empire refers to the protohistorical period during which the Roman Empire interacted with the area that is now Scotland, which was known to them as \"Caledonia\". Roman legions arrived around \u00a071, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \"Britain\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \"Albion\", Romans under Q.\u00a0Petillius Cerialis and Gn.\u00a0Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \"Mons Graupius\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. [PAR] The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held any Scottish land at all for about 80 years. Some Scottish historians such as Moffat go so far as to say Rome's presence was entirely uninfluential. \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti, Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast as well. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. [PAR] The dawn of Scottish history [PAR] Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. [PAR] The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \"very large\" British Isles called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285\u00a0 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).  [PAR] The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in \u00a043 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.   The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.  Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.

He is a pompous, blustering figure with overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager, and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He believes in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. He is class conscious and a snob, considering himself upper-middle class and looking down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. His pretensions stand in contrast to Wilson , who is genuinely Upper Middle Class, Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's having attending public school, believing it made him 'wet', while his own state-school background is an attribute. Mainwaring and Wilson's relationship is mainly based on the fact that Mainwaring has always had to struggle and fight for everything in his life, whereas Wilson has just sat back and let it all come to him, (despite being a strong autocrat, Mainwaring fully believes that people should work and earn everything they get in life). Mainwaring is prudish and repressed, and can be judgemental about people who do not share his moral outlook. [PAR] Mainwaring [PAR] Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those he considers beneath him, and his arrogance is frequently punctured by circumstance and the people around him, such as Arthur Wilson , his chief clerk with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship, and Private Walker , a black-marketeer who interjects during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefitting from underhanded deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not, and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. [PAR] As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he is barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, and his plans result in chaos. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain of World War I. (In World War II, John Le Mesurier who played Wilson, had been a Captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major). He did, however, serve in the army of occupation in France, \"during the whole of 1919 \u2014 somebody had to clear up the mess.\" (He tried to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight; Arthur Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to World War II but was also rejected with poor eyesight.)

His height and background is frequently demonstrated to show a Napoleon Complex; he is frequently referred to as 'Napoleon' by his nemesis Hodges . In one episode, A Soldier's Farewell , Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte , and is thwarted at the Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington looking like Wilson. His pomposity and conviction of his prowess see Mainwaring yearn to be in control of any situation, and he behaves in an arrogant manner; this is demonstrated by the first episode, in which he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience or qualifications (and had to wait until the episode Room at the Bottom before he received his commission).

He gained a reputation as a swaggering militarist through his speeches and ill-advised newspaper interviews. While Wilhelm did not actively seek war, and tried to hold back his generals from mobilizing the German army in the summer of 1914, his verbal outbursts and his open enjoyment of the title of Supreme War Lord helped bolster the case of those who blamed him for the conflict. His role in the conduct of the war as well as his responsibility for its outbreak is still controversial. Some historians maintain that Wilhelm was controlled by his generals, while others argue that he retained considerable political power. In late 1918, he was forced to abdicate. He spent the rest of his life in exile in the Netherlands, where he died at age 82. [PAR] Google [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s Early Years [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was born in Potsdam, Germany, on January 27, 1859, the son of Prince Frederick Wilhelm of Prussia (1831-88) and Princess Victoria (1840-1901), the oldest daughter of Queen Victoria of England (1819-1901). The future monarch was the queen\u2019s firstborn grandchild and was genuinely fond of her; in fact, he was holding her in his arms when she died. His ties to Britain through its royal family would play an important part in his later political maneuvering. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was reportedly amused when he heard his cousin King George V (1865-1936) had changed the name of the British royal family from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor in 1917 as a result of anti-German sentiment in Britain during World War I. [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s childhood was shaped by two events, one medical and one political. His birth had been traumatic; in the course of a complicated delivery, the doctor permanently damaged Wilhelm\u2019s left arm. In addition to its smaller size, the arm was useless for such ordinary tasks as cutting certain foods with a knife at mealtime. [PAR] The political event that shaped Wilhelm was the formation of the German Empire under the leadership of Prussia in 1871. Wilhelm was now second in line after his father to become an emperor as well as king of Prussia. Twelve years old at the time, Wilhelm was filled with nationalistic enthusiasm. His later determination to win a \u201cplace in the sun\u201d for Germany had its roots in his childhood. [PAR] An intelligent young man who possessed a lifelong interest in science and technology, Wilhelm was educated at the University of Bonn. His quick mind, however, was combined with an even quicker temper and an impulsive, high-strung personality. He had dysfunctional relationships with both parents, particularly his English mother. Historians still debate the effects of the kaiser\u2019s complicated psychological makeup on his political decisions. [PAR] In 1881, Wilhelm married Princess Augusta Victoria (1858-1921) of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple would go on to have seven children. [PAR] Emperor and King: 1888 [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s father became Kaiser Frederick III of Germany in March 1888. Already ill with terminal throat cancer, he died after a reign of only several months.

Within two years of his coronation, Wilhelm broke with Otto von Bismarck (1815-98), the \u201cIron Chancellor\u201d who had dominated German politics since the 1860s.

[PAR] Review [PAR] The Wire: The Complete First Season [PAR] After one episode of The Wire you'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of  its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series'  remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American  masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter  from The Baltimore Sun who cowrote the book that inspired TV's Homicide ,  and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable  street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece to The Corner )  that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on  institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil  police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price  (especially Clockers), the series opens as maverick Detective  Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a  vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's  deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a  haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex  investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance. [PAR] The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so  breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to  life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description.  Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the  unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson,  helmer of The Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to  the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable,  complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention, The Wire is \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy  answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate  in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the  cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to  the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving  you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in  season 2. --Jeff Shannon [PAR] The Wire: The Complete Second Season [PAR] It hardly seems possible, but The Wire's second season is even better than the first .  The \"visual novel\" concept of this masterful HBO series is taken even  further in a rich, labyrinthine plot revolving around the longshoremen  of Baltimore's struggling cargo docks, where corruption, smuggling, and  murder draw the attention of detective McNulty (Dominic West). What  follows is a series of events which at first seem unrelated (including  13 bodies found in a cargo container), and then the ongoing effort to  topple the drug empire of \"Stringer\" Bell (Idris Elba) and the  imprisoned Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris), whose business is suffering  from short supply, high demand, and disruption of distribution. The  dutiful diligence of a Marine Police Patrol Officer and the moral  outrage of the longshoremen's union leader are also factored into the  suspicious goings-on at the loading docks, and what unfolds in these 12  episodes is an American crime epic easily on par with the Godfather saga.

The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.\u00a0 Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.\u00a0 The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.\u00a0 The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley\" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.\u00a0 He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real. But he did have fun playing in the clouds. He made Sir Basil suffer when he shot his tail off, as he pretended to be dead. Poor Sir Basil didn't know what to do, so as usual shouted for Lady Rosemary, who saw Parsley was faking it. His best friend is Dill the dog and both of them seem to get themselves into trouble. But once in a while Parsley does come up with a good idea, such as the time he persuaded Pashana Bedhi to use his snake charming skills to float Sage and his nest back in the tree. \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley with a tail for doing jobs of every kind but I mustn't treat it roughly or too harshly for it's such a useful thing to have behind\" His songs are: \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I am always very glad to see you wave but please don't shout or speak to me too harshly because I'm not particularly brave\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I really don't like climbing things at all so please don't shout or speak to me too harshly I am sure you wouldn't want to see me fall\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I'm supposed to pull this rope and ring the bell though I try to pull it gently never harshly I'm afraid that I'm not doing very well\" \"For today I", "topic": "The narrative structure of \u201cThe Herbs,\u201d specifically the magic herb garden concept and the role of the narrator.", "question": "What is the primary function of the narrator in \u201cThe Herbs\u201d as described in the text?", "choices": {"A": "To provide historical context for the development of the television series.", "B": "To introduce the various herbs and their associated magical properties within the garden.", "C": "To guide the audience through the magical herb garden and narrate the weekly adventures.", "D": "To offer musical performances showcasing the characters\u2019 individual songs."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that the narrator (Gordon Rollings) \u201ctalk[s] about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear.\u201d This directly describes the narrator\u2019s role as a guide and storyteller within the garden setting.", "question_token_count": 21, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 14}

These distinctions are made on the basis of floristic composition and distribution -- the species of plants growing in a particular desert region. Plant communities, in turn, are determined by the geologic history of a region, the soil and mineral conditions, the elevation and the patterns of precipitation. [PAR] Three of these deserts -- the Chihuahuan, the Sonoran and the Mojave -- are called \"hot deserts,\" because of their high temperatures during the long summer and because the evolutionary affinities of their plant life are largely with the subtropical plant communities to the south. The Great Basin Desert is called a \"cold desert\" because it is generally cooler and its dominant plant life is not subtropical in origin. [PAR] Chihuahuan Desert : A small area of southeastern New Mexico and extreme western Texas, extending south into a vast area of Mexico. [PAR] Great Basin Desert : The northern three-quarters of Nevada, western and southern Utah, to the southern third of Idaho and the southeastern corner of Oregon. According to some, it also includes small portions of western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming. Bordered on the south by the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts. [PAR] Mojave Desert : A portion of southern Nevada, extreme southwestern Utah and of eastern California, north of the Sonoran Desert. [PAR] Sonoran Desert : An arid region covering approximately 100,000 square miles in southwestern Arizona and southeastern California, as well as most of Baja California and the western half of the state of Sonora, Mexico. Subdivisions of this hot, dry region include the Colorado and Yuma deserts. [PAR] Desert Disagreements [PAR] This classification of North American deserts is by no means universally accepted by all biologists, geologists and other scientists. For instance, some maintain that the Mojave is not a distinct desert at all, but simply a transition zone between the Great Basin and Sonoran deserts. Even among those who agree upon this classification, there is disagreement over the exact geographic areas circumscribed by each of the four deserts. Some scientists would use animals and other criteria, as well as distribution of plant species, to determine desert different boundaries for these four deserts. [PAR] The Colorado Plateau is another major source of disagreement among scientists. This semiarid region of southern Utah and northern Arizona contains many majestic national parks, including Arches and Grand Canyon. Yet, experts cannot agree on the desert classification of this geologically distinct region. Some do not include the Colorado Plateau within any desert at all; others call this area the Painted Desert; still others, DesertUSA included, consider this region the southeastern extent of the Great Basin Desert. [PAR] Grand Canyon from North Rim [PAR] An additional source of confusion is provided by the great number of desert names (i.e. Yuman Desert, Colorado Desert, etc.) that do not match any of the four major deserts listed above. These names usually refer to local subdivisions within one of the four major deserts. These \"deserts\" are identified and defined below.

Dickens and his illustrator Hablot Browne        (phiz) traveled incognito to Yorkshire on a fact-finding mission in        January 1838. There they encountered William Shaw, headmaster of Bowes Academy,        in whose school several boys had died or went blind from mistreatment and        neglect. [PAR] Visiting a cemetery in the area Dickens found the graves of many of the        students of these schools and one in particular Dickens said \"put Smike        into my head\". Smike was the abused inmate of Dotheboys Hall, the fictional        school he based on Shaw's Bowes Academy in Nicholas Nickleby. The        fictional headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, Wackford Squeers, was based on William        Shaw. [PAR] The ignorance of the schoolmaster Squeers is more than a comic exaggeration.

In the preface to the Cheap Edition              of Nicholas Nickleby in 1848 Dickens claimed that the brothers              were based on real persons \"with whom I never interchanged any communication              in my life\". Paul Davis in The Penguin Dickens Companion says              that the brothers were based on William and Daniel Grant, Manchester              calico merchants whom Dickens met in 1838.

The rider leading a classification at the end of a stage is required to wear  the corresponding jersey during the next stage. [PAR] Jerseys  are awarded in a ceremony immediately following the stage. Where a single rider leads in the competition for more than one jersey, they  wear the most prestigious jersey to which they are entitled, and the  second-placed rider in each of the other classifications becomes entitled to  wear the corresponding jersey. [PAR] Yellow Jersey [PAR] The yellow jersey, known in French as the maillot jaune, is worn by the overall time  leader, and is the most prized jersey. It is awarded by calculating the total combined race  time up to that point for each rider. The yellow jersey was first awarded in 1919 to make the race leader stand out. The color yellow was chosen because the pages of the race sponsor's magazine,  L'Auto, were yellow. [PAR] Green Jersey [PAR] The green jersey, known in French as the maillot vert, is awarded to the cyclist with the highest number of sprint points. Points for this jersey are gained by the riders who  finish first, second, etc., at the end of each stage. The number of points for each place and the number  of riders rewarded varies depending on the type of stage as the flatter stages are more likely to result in a sprint finish. Flat stages give the  winner 35 points down to 1 point for the 25th rider; medium mountain stages  give the winner 25 points down to 1 point for the 20th rider; high mountain  stages give the winner 20 points down to 1 point for the 15th rider. Points are also awarded for  individual time trial stages: 15 for the winner down to 1 for the 10th rider. Additional points are available at intermediate sprint contests, usually  occurring 2 or 3 times in each stage at pre-determined locations; currently 6,  4 and 2 points are available to the first 3 riders at each sprint. [PAR] Polka Dot  Jersey [PAR] The  winner of the King of the Mountain wears a white jersey with red  dots (known as the maillot \u00e0 pois rouges in French), which is commonly referred to as the \"polka dot jersey\". Although the best climber was first recognized in 1933 as the \"King of the Mountain\", the distinctive  polka dot jersey was not introduced until 1975. The colors were decided by the then  sponsor, Poulain Chocolate, to match a popular product. At the top of each climb in the Tour,  there are points awarded for the riders who are first over the top. The climbs are  divided into categories, from 1  to 4  based on  their difficulty with 1 being the most difficult, measured as a function of their steepness and length. A fifth  category, called Hors categorie (outside category) is formed by  mountains even more difficult than those of the number 1 category. In 2004, the  scoring system was changed so that the first rider over a fourth category  climb was awarded 3 points while the first to complete a hors category  climb would win 20 points. Further points over a fourth category climb are only  for the top three places while on a hors category climb the top ten riders are  rewarded. Also, beginning in 2004, the points scored on the final climb of  the day were doubled if such a climb was at least a second category climb.

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism. [PAR] Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election. [PAR] On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her re-election in 1983. [PAR] Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire, which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. After a series of small strokes in 2002, she was advised to withdraw from public speaking. Despite this, she managed to prerecord a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death, which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004.  In 2013, she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87.

Her father was Alfred Roberts, originally from Northamptonshire, and her mother was Beatrice Ethel (n\u00e9e Stephenson) from Lincolnshire. She spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned two grocery shops. She and her older sister Muriel (1921\u20132004) were raised in the flat above the larger of the two, on North Parade. Her father was active in local politics and the Methodist church, serving as an alderman and a local preacher, and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist  attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church. He came from a Liberal family but stood \u2013 as was then customary in local government \u2013 as an Independent. He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945\u201346 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.

I am sure many ladies out there would be envious of their Soprano friends who seem to be able to hit the high notes with such ease! [PAR] A typical Soprano vocal range would probably be from the A note below middle C (A3) to the F or G note 2 octaves above (F6 or G6), making it a range of 2 plus to 3 octaves. Of course, this is not to be taken as an exact measurement but more as a rough guideline for soprano voices, and proper breath support must be used when measuring vocal ranges during singing. [PAR] The Soprano Tessitura is also usually higher than the other female voice types, considering that the overall vocal range is the highest among the female voices. [PAR] A Soprano would also probably transition out of her chest voice around the E flat note above middle C (E4) and shift into her head voice around the F sharp note one octave above the middle C (F5). [PAR] The soprano voice usually has a bright tone, and she would usually have a strong head voice, but a relatively weaker middle voice. Sopranos are also able to sing more high notes and sustain at a high pitch better than a mezzo soprano can, and they are also most often the lead role for operas or shows. [PAR] 2. MEZZO SOPRANO [PAR] For most ladies out there, you would probably belong to this voice type as the Mezzo Soprano voice is the most common female voice type out of the 3 main types, and it lies between the higher Soprano voice and the lower Contralto voice.

More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 were killed during the hysteria. [PAR] Ever since those dark days ended, the trials have become synonymous with mass hysteria and scapegoating. The following are some facts about the Salem Witch Trials: [PAR] What Were the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials were a series of witchcraft cases brought before local magistrates in a settlement called Salem which was a part of the Massachusetts Bay colony in the 17th century. [PAR] When Exactly Did the Salem Witch Trials Take Place? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials officially began in February of 1692, when the afflicted girls accused the first three victims, Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchcraft and ended in May of 1693, when the remaining victims were released from jail. [PAR] What Caused the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials was a classic example of scapegoating. Fear combined with a \u201ctrigger,\u201d a traumatic or stressful event, is what often leads to scapegoating. Fear of the Devil, and witches who did his bidding, was very real in Salem at the time. [PAR] In Massachusetts during the 17th century , people often feared that the Devil was constantly trying to find ways to infiltrate and destroy Christians and their communities. [PAR] As a devout and strongly religious community living in near isolation in the mysterious New World, the community of Salem had a heightened sense of fear of the Devil and then experienced a \u201ctrigger\u201d when Tituba, one of the accused witches, confessed that she and others were in fact witches working for the Devil. [PAR] This induced panic and hysteria and quickly sparked a massive witch hunt. The fact is, although there were many other contributing factors, Tituba\u2019s confession is the main reason why the Salem Witch Trials happened. [PAR] The Massachusetts Bay colonists had accused and convicted people of witchcraft before, starting with Margaret Jones in 1648, but nobody in the colony had ever confessed to being a witch before or ominously stated that there were other witches out there. Tituba\u2019s simple confession reinforced all of the colonist\u2019s underlying fears. [PAR] \u201cThe Witch, No. 1,\u201d lithograph by Joseph E. Baker, published by George H. Walker & Co, circa 1892 [PAR] In addition to this constant sense of fear, Salem residents were also under a great deal of stress during this period due to a number of factors. [PAR] One major factor was that in 1684, King Charles II revoked the Massachusetts Bay Colony\u2019s royal charter, a legal document granting the colonists permission to colonize the area. [PAR] The charter was revoked because the colonists had violated several of the charter\u2019s rules, which included basing laws on religious beliefs and discriminating against Anglicans. [PAR] Charles II died shortly after and James II replaced him and merged the Massachusetts Bay Colony into the Dominion of New England which instituted a royally-appointed government with many strict new laws. In 1689, after the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, the Massachusetts Bay colonists overthrew the unpopular Dominion of New England. [PAR] In 1691, the new King and Queen of England, Mary and William of Orange, issued a new, more anti-religious charter, instead of reissuing the old charter, and also combined the Massachusetts Bay Colony , Plymouth Colony and several other colonies into one. The new charter and regime basically continued the policies of the Dominion of New England. [PAR] The puritans, who had left England due to religious persecution, feared their religion was under attack again and worried they were losing control of their colony. The political instability and threat to their religion created a feeling of uneasiness and discontent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [PAR] Other factors included a recent small pox epidemic in the colony, growing rivalries between families within the colony, a constant threat of attack from nearby Native-American tribes, and a recent influx of refugees trying to escape King William\u2019s war with France in Canada and upstate New York.

It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used to refer to actions of the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\".  [PAR] The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban  and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico  in 1829. [PAR] Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.

The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement.

In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. [PAR] The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it. [PAR] President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On November 1, in 1800,  he became the first president to occupy the White House.

Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999.

[PAR] L'Escargot's first Gold Cup victory in 1970 was notable for the fact that it started as a 33/1 outsider. Only the 100/1 winner Norton's Coin has ever won a Gold Cup at longer odds. [PAR] 5. Kauto Star - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] The French-bred Kauto Star is the only horse to have regained a Gold Cup and has also the only horse to win the King George VI Chase four consecutive times. [PAR] Having won the Gold Cup as favourite in 2007, Kauto Star was beaten by his stablemate Denman in 2008. The Paul Nicholls horse bounced back to regain the Gold Cup in 2009, as he defeated Denman by 13 lengths, with a run described by Timeform as: \"Arguably the best performance in the race since Arkle.\" [PAR] 4. Cottage Rake - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Cottage Rake was failed by a vet on three separate examinations, before embarking on a jumping career in which the horse won three Cheltenham Gold Cups. [PAR] Consecutive victories in 1948,1949 and 1950 saw Cottage Rake become only the second horse to win the Gold Cup three times in a row. After his third victory, Cottage Rake completely lost form, but had already done enough to write it's name into the history books. [PAR] 3. Best Mate - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Best Mate won three consecutive Gold Cups between 2002 and 2004. It is possible that the horse and jockey Jim Culloty would have gone on to eclipse the legendary Arkle and win a fourth Gold Cup, but Best Mate pulled out of the race in 2005 having burst a blood vessel just eight days before the race. [PAR] That same year, Best Mate hit the front pages, after he suffered a heart attack and died while racing at Exeter. Best Mate's ashes were buried beside the winning post at Cheltenham, where he had enjoyed so many triumphs. [PAR] 2. Arkle - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Arkle won the Gold Cup in 1964, 1965 and 1966. Such was Arkle's dominance at the time, that it is likely that he would have gone on to win the race again, but a fractured pedal bone saw the horse put out for retirement.

There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900.

Richard has been accused of having his nephews murdered, but historians debate the boys' fate. It is possible that they died imprisoned in the tower but were not killed.

The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931\u00a0BC, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. [PAR] According to the Talmud, Solomon is one of the 48 prophets.  In the Qur'an, he is considered a major prophet, and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman, son of David.  Solomon (Arabic \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 Sulaym\u0101n) was, according to the Qur'an, a king of ancient Israel as well as the son of David. The Qur'an recognizes Solomon as a prophet and a divinely-appointed monarch. Islamic tradition generally holds that Solomon was the third king of Israel and was a just and wise ruler for the nation.  [PAR] The Hebrew Bible credits him as the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem. It portrays him as great in wisdom, wealth, and power beyond any of the previous kings of the country, but ultimately as a human king who sinned. His sins included idolatry and turning away from Yahweh, and led to the kingdom's being torn in two during the reign of his son Rehoboam.  Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends, most notably in the 1st-century apocryphal work known as the Testament of Solomon. In later years, in mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.  [PAR] Biblical account [PAR] Childhood [PAR] Solomon was born in Jerusalem,  the second born child to David and his wife Bathsheba, widow of Uriah the Hittite. The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died before Solomon was conceived as a punishment by Yahweh on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers through Bathsheba, Nathan, Shammua, and Shobab,  besides six known older half-brothers through as many mothers.  [PAR] Succession and administration [PAR] According to the First Book of Kings, when David was old, \"he could not get warm.\"  \"So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.\" [PAR] While David was in this state, court factions were maneuvering for power. David's heir apparent, Adonijah, acted to have himself declared king, but was outmaneuvered by Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan, who convinced David to proclaim Solomon king according to his earlier promise, despite Solomon being younger than his brothers. [PAR] Solomon, as instructed by David, began his reign with an extensive purge, including his father's chief general, Joab, among others, and further consolidated his position by appointing friends throughout the administration, including in religious positions as well as in civic and military posts. [PAR] Solomon greatly expanded his military strength, especially the cavalry and chariot arms. He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts. [PAR] Trade relationships were a focus of his administration.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] White HouseThe White House is the official residence and principal workplace of the President of the United States, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used to refer to actions of the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\".  [PAR] The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban  and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico  in 1829. [PAR] Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt. [PAR] The modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice President\u2014and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of \"America's Favorite Architecture\". [PAR] Early history [PAR] 1789\u20131800 [PAR] Following his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two executive mansions in New York City: the Samuel Osgood House at 3 Cherry Street (April 1789\u00a0\u2013 February 1790), and the Alexander Macomb House at 39\u201341 Broadway (February\u2013August 1790). In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. [PAR] The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it. [PAR] President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On November 1, in 1800,  he became the first president to occupy the White House. The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania.

Please visit our online store and go shopping at the number one imported food delivery service in the USA. England has a rich cheese making history. English cheese is known for its slow aged, intense flavors made from traditional recipes handed down through the generations.  While cheese has been produced in England for thousands of years, today England produces hundreds of varieties of cheeses.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar and Blue Stilton, England's first and second most famous cheeses, have both been given PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status which establishes traditional methods for its production.  English PDO Cheeses must be made with local ingredients within certain geographical locations related to the specific cheese.  PDO protection helps ensure that an English Cheese like Farmhouse Cheddar or Blue Stilton does not stray from original recipes and continues England's time tested cheesemaking traditions. England continues to create new and unique cheese blends such as Cotswold (Double Gloucester with Onions and Chives) and the best-selling English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions. [PAR] Types of English Cheese: [PAR] Cheddar: Cheddar cheese originated the 1100s, perhaps earlier, in the village of Cheddar in southwestern England near the geological feature called Cheddar Gorge. Cheddar Gorge is a series of caves that naturally maintain the ideal conditions (humidity, temperature, etc.) for cheese ripening. In the 1800s, Joseph Harding, known as the modern father of Cheddar Cheese, revolutionized the cheddar cheese making process with advanced technology.  He is responsible for launching the Cheddar cheese making industries of Scotland, Canada, America and Australia.  Today this most famous English Cheese is made throughout the world, but especially in past members of the British Empire.  Cheddar is naturally white or pale yellow in color, the yellow coming from naturally occuring carotene in grass eaten by dairy cows. Darker yellow to orange varieties are produced using a natural food colorant called annatto.  Almost synonymous today with the phrase English Cheese, Cheddar develops a stronger, sharper taste the longer it ages.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar has been given PDO (name protection) status from the EU, requiring that it be produced from the milk within Devon, Dorset, Cornwall or Somerset, England. [PAR] Cheshire: Cheshire is considered to be the original English Cheese. It is firm and crumbly in texture with a mild, slightly salty flavor.  This white, or more typically yellow-orange cheese, again colored by annatto, is great crumbled over salads. It is also delicious with fruit or as a dessert cheese. [PAR] Lancashire: Lancashire is another ancient English Cheese whose history dates back to the 1200s.  It is traditionally made in three varieties based on the cheese's maturity: Creamy, Tasty or Crumbly.  Creamy Lancashire is matured between 4 and 12 weeks, while Tasty is matured from 12 weeks to 24 months.  Crumbly Lancashire was first produced in the 1960s and is usually eaten at 6 to 8 weeks in age.  Crumbly Lancashire is mild and fresh-tasting with a firm, dry and crumbly texture. We sometimes think of it as England's answer to Feta. [PAR] Blue Stilton: Known as the \"The King Of English Cheeses,\" Blue Stilton is a blue-mold English Cheese with a rich and mellow flavor and a smooth and creamy consistency.  Blue Stilton is recognized by its striking blue-green veins, naturally crinkly rind (inedible), complex flavor and crumbly texture. While Blue Stilton is milder than other famous blues of the world like Roquefort and Gorgonzola, it is excellent for crumbling over salads or as a dessert cheese, famously served with a Port Wine.

[PAR] Each year, the winner of The Masters is presented with the famous \"Green Jacket.\" Slipping on the green jacket is the golden moment for many winners of the tournament. But how did a green jacket come to be such a big deal? What is the story behind the venerated Green Jacket? [PAR] Origins of the Masters Green Jacket [PAR] Let's face it: If you saw someone walking around in public in a shamrock green jacket, you might wonder if that person was fashion-challenged. But the Green Jacket presented to the Masters champion is one beautiful piece of outerwear. [PAR] The tradition of the Green Jacket at Augusta National Golf Club dates to 1937. That year, members of the club wore green jackets during the tournament so that fans in attendance could easily recognize them if a fan needed to ask questions. [PAR] One of the inspirations for the idea was provided by a dinner that Augusta National co-founder Bobby Jones attended at Royal Liverpool . The English links club's captains were adorned in red jackets during that dinner, to stand out. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Greatest Quarterbacks of All Time? [PAR] Augusta National co-founder and club chairman Clifford Roberts embraced the idea of an identifying piece of clothing for club members - something that would make it easy for non-members (and tournament attendees) to recognize an Augusta member. [PAR] According to the tournament's official website, Masters.com: [PAR] \"Jackets were purchased from the Brooks Uniform Company, New York City ... Members were not initially enthusiastic about wearing the warm, green coat. Within several years, a lightweight, made-to-order Jacket was available from the Club's Golf Shop. ... The single breasted, single vent Jacket's color is 'Masters Green' and is adorned with an Augusta National Golf Club logo on the left chest pocket. The logo also appears on the brass buttons.\" [PAR] Presenting the Green Jacket to the Masters Winners [PAR] Soon after its public debut in 1937, the Green Jacket became the symbol of membership in the ultra-exclusive Augusta National Golf Club. [PAR] And winners of the Masters Tournament began, themselves, receiving green jackets at the 1949 Masters . The winners all become members of the Champions Club at Augusta. From 1937 through 1948, only Augusta National members wore the green jackets; from 1949 onward, the tournament winner also got one. [PAR] By the way, in those early years it was just as common to hear Masters players and Augusta members refer to the garment as the \"green blazer\" or \"green coat,\" as it was for them to use \"green jacket.\" [PAR] Who Was the First Masters Champ Presented with the Green Jacket? [PAR] You already know the jacket was first presented to the Masters winner following the 1949 tournament. And the winner that year was Sam Snead . At that time, the club also had jackets made for each of the previous winners of the Masters. For more, see: [PAR] Who was the first Masters champion awarded the Green Jacket? [PAR] Does the Masters Winner Get to Keep the Jacket? [PAR] The short answer: The Green Jacket stays with the new winner for one year. When they return to Augusta National the following year for the next Masters, they return the jacket. But each winner can have his own version of the jacket made to keep at home. For more, see: [PAR] Do Masters champions get to keep the Green Jacket? [PAR] Last Year's Champ Puts the Green Jacket on the New Winner [PAR] Following the completion of each Masters Tournament, the Green Jacket ceremony is held, where the new champion is presented with the green jacket. That jacket is one that tournament officials have retrieved from the locker room, guesstimating what will fit best the new winner. Later, the champ is measured and a jacket custom made for him.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Channel IslandsThe Channel Islands (Norman: \u00celes d'la Manche, French: \u00celes Anglo-Normandes or \u00celes de la Manche) are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy. They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom,  it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands.  They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198\u00a0km2. [PAR] The two bailiwicks have been administered separately since the late 13th century; each has its own independent laws, elections, and representative bodies (although in modern times, politicians from the islands' legislatures are in regular contact).

[PAR] The Chausey Islands south of Jersey are not generally included in the geographical definition of the Channel Islands but are occasionally described in English as 'French Channel Islands' in view of their French jurisdiction. They were historically linked to the Duchy of Normandy, but they are part of the French territory along with continental Normandy, and not part of the British Isles or of the Channel Islands in a political sense. They are an incorporated part of the commune of Granville (Manche). While they are popular with visitors from France, Channel Islanders rarely visit them as there are no direct transport links from the other islands. [PAR] In official Jersey French, the islands are called '\u00celes de la Manche', while in France, the term '\u00celes Anglo-normandes' (Anglo-Norman isles) is used to refer to the British 'Channel Islands' in contrast to other islands in the Channel. Chausey is referred to as an '\u00cele normande' (as opposed to anglo-normande).

The descendant of Viking raiders, he had been Duke of Normandy since 1035. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son. [PAR] William was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine. [PAR] In the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him, and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent. [PAR] William's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey listing all the landholders in England along with their holdings. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire, but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, Robert, and his second surviving son, William, received England. [PAR] Background  [PAR] Norsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit).

With a history that spans over a thousand years, South America has been culturally influenced by Spanish, Portuguese, Asian, and African cultures. [PAR] Europeans explored South America beginning in the late fifteenth century, and the continent was named after Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci who is believed to have recognized it as a separate continent. Located primarily in the southern hemisphere, with a few countries in the northern hemisphere, South America is comprised of twelve independent countries and three territories. [PAR] Geography [PAR] South America is bound by the Caribbean Sea in the north, the North Atlantic Ocean in the east and northeast and by the South Atlantic Ocean in the southeast. The South Pacific Ocean borders the continent in the west. In the northwest, the Isthmus of Panama joins South America with North America. South America is also home to a stunning variety of landscapes from desert to rainforest, and from plains to hills. [PAR] Historic Overview [PAR] South America has a long history, dating back to human migration across the Bering Land Bridge. By about 1200 BC hunters traveled from Asia to Alaska, crossing the Bering Strait and drifted gradually south. From 1400 to 1550, the indigenous people of the Inca Empire spread across South America to regions in modern-day Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Northern Argentina, and Peru. [PAR] In 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered the \"New World\", and the number of Spanish explorers increased between 1496 and 1526. In 1533, the Spanish Army led by Francisco Pizarro had captured much of Inca territory. In the period between 1535 and 1537, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia were founded, and by the eighteenth century the Spanish colonies in South America started to make a serious bid for independence. While fighting wars against France on the European mainland, Spain began to lose control of its South American colonies, and by the end of the war in 1814, countries like Argentina and Venezuela gained their independence from Spain, and other nations followed suit. In the twentieth century, several South American countries, including Peru and Venezuela, had held elections for the first time after their independence. [PAR] Economy [PAR] The manufacturing industries, agriculture, and trade primarily support the economy of South America. The economies of many South American countries are based on export of goods, primarily the export of agricultural products. Brazil and Argentina lead in the export of goods to other nations. Some of the major agricultural products include sugarcane, corn, wheat, soybean, and coffee. South America's mineral resources also contribute substantially to the economy. Some major mineral resources found in South America are petroleum, gold, iron ore, silver, and copper. [PAR] South American countries have shown remarkable economic development in the past two decades. Countries like Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Peru, Chile, and Uruguay have had maximum growth, even during the global recession of 2008 and 2009. South American countries have shown resilience as compared to other nations around the world. The major challenge that South America's economy faces is the high levels of inequality between the rich and the poor in many countries. The gap between the rich and the poor in South America is highest in the world. In response, many South American countries are trying to come together with the help of two trade blocs, the Mercosur, which includes countries like Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Paraguay; and the Andean Community of Nations, which includes countries such as Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, and Chile. These trade blocs help the countries strengthen their economic ties and improve their economies.

[PAR] Although he only ruled for two years \u2013 from 1483 to 1485 \u2013 Richard III stands out among his peers as one of the most famous (or infamous) Kings of England. But who was he? And why does he continue to inspire such interest? [PAR] Richard was born in Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire on 2 October 1452 \u2013 about 30 miles (50km) from Leicester and only about 40 miles (65km - two days\u2019 ride) from Bosworth where he met his end a third of a century later.

Young Edward and his brother moved into the Tower of London (which was then a royal palace, not a prison) but in June their parents\u2019 marriage was declared invalid, making the princes illegitimate and hence their uncle became the heir apparent. Richard lost no time in being crowned King Richard III and the two boys were not seen again. [PAR] Thus began the legend of \u2018the Princes in the Tower\u2019 and a long-standing popular belief that Richard had his nephews murdered in order to remove any competing claim to the throne. This has been widely debated for many years, with passionate arguments made both for and against Richard. [PAR] Death and disappearance [PAR] After defeating an unsuccessful rebellion in October 1483, Richard led his army to Bosworth in Leicestershire two years later to face Henry Tudor (whose somewhat tenuous claim to the throne was also through descent from Edward III). On 22 August 1485, Richard was killed at Bosworth Field, the last English King to die in battle, thereby bringing to an end both the Plantagenet dynasty and the Wars of the Roses. Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII. [PAR] Richard\u2019s body was brought back to Leicester, publicly displayed and then given for burial to a group of Franciscan friars. An alabaster tomb monument was constructed over the grave in 1495, paid for by the new King.

The tribes kept track of the seasons by giving distinctive names to each recurring full Moon. Their names were applied to the entire month in which each occurred. There was some variation in the Moon names, but in general, the same ones were current throughout the Algonquin tribes from New England to Lake Superior. European settlers followed that custom and created some of their own names. Since the lunar month is only 29 days long on the average, the full Moon dates shift from year to year. Here is the Farmers Almanac\u2019s list of the full Moon names. [PAR] \u2013 Full Wolf Moon \u2013 January Amid the cold and deep snows of midwinter, the wolf packs howled hungrily outside Indian villages. Thus, the name for January\u2019s full Moon. Sometimes it was also referred to as the Old Moon, or the Moon After Yule. Some called it the Full Snow Moon, but most tribes applied that name to the next Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Snow Moon \u2013 February Since the heaviest snow usually falls during this month, native tribes of the north and east most often called February\u2019s full Moon the Full Snow Moon. Some tribes also referred to this Moon as the Full Hunger Moon, since harsh weather conditions in their areas made hunting very difficult. [PAR] \u2013 Full Worm Moon \u2013 March As the temperature begins to warm and the ground begins to thaw, earthworm casts appear, heralding the return of the robins. The more northern tribes knew this Moon as the Full Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signaled the end of winter; or the Full Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing at night. The Full Sap Moon, marking the time of tapping maple trees, is another variation. To the settlers, it was also known as the Lenten Moon, and was considered to be the last full Moon of winter. [PAR] \u2013 Full Pink Moon \u2013 April This name came from the herb moss pink, or wild ground phlox, which is one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring. Other names for this month\u2019s celestial body include the Full Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon, and among coastal tribes the Full Fish Moon, because this was the time that the shad swam upstream to spawn. [PAR] \u2013 Full Flower Moon \u2013 May In most areas, flowers are abundant everywhere during this time. Thus, the name of this Moon. Other names include the Full Corn Planting Moon, or the Milk Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Strawberry Moon \u2013 June This name was universal to every Algonquin tribe. However, in Europe they called it the Rose Moon. Also because the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries comes each year during the month of June . . . so the full Moon that occurs during that month was christened for the strawberry! [PAR] \u2013 The Full Buck Moon \u2013 July July is normally the month when the new antlers of buck deer push out of their foreheads in coatings of velvety fur. It was also often called the Full Thunder Moon, for the reason that thunderstorms are most frequent during this time. Another name for this month\u2019s Moon was the Full Hay Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Sturgeon Moon \u2013 August The fishing tribes are given credit for the naming of this Moon, since sturgeon, a large fish of the Great Lakes and other major bodies of water, were most readily caught during this month.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is an English Christmas carol that enumerates in the manner of a cumulative song a series of increasingly grand gifts given on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days after Christmas). The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin. \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68. The tunes of collected versions vary. The standard tune now associated with it is derived from a 1909 arrangement of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin, who first introduced the now familiar prolongation of the verse \"five gold rings\".

There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by \"my true love\" on one of the twelve days of Christmas. [PAR] There are many variations in the lyrics.

Subsequent versions have shown considerable variation: [PAR] * In the earliest versions, the word \"On\" is not present at the beginning of each verse\u2014for example, the first verse begins simply \"The first day of Christmas\".  \"On\" was added in Austin's 1909 version, and became very popular thereafter. [PAR] * In the early versions \"my true love sent\" me the gifts. However, a 20th-century variant has \"my true love gave to me\"; this wording has become particularly common in North America.  [PAR] * The 1780 version has \"four colly birds\"\u2014\"colly\" being a regional English expression for \"black\".   This wording must have been opaque to many even in the 19th century: \"canary birds\", \"colour'd birds\", \"curley birds\", and \"corley birds\" are found in its place.  Frederic Austin's 1909 version, which introduced the now-standard melody, also altered the fourth day's gift to four \"calling\" birds, and this variant has become the most popular, although \"colly\" is still found. [PAR] * The \"five gold rings\" may become \"five golden rings\", especially in North America. In the standard melody, this change enables singers to fit one syllable per musical note.

Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity.  Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit).

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Henry III of EnglandHenry III (1 October 1207\u00a0\u2013 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death.  The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. [PAR] Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. [PAR] By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX of France recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. [PAR] In 1263 one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised. [PAR] Background and childhood [PAR] Henry was born in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207.

It is a mausoleum made of white marble, in which the Emperor had his wife entombed, and after his own death, Emperor Shah Jahan was entombed next to his wife. [PAR] In the official history of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign, written by Abdul Hamid Lahori in his book Badshahnama, he mentions the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara, which means the illumined or famous tomb. [PAR] Designed in the Mughal Empire style with touches of Persian influence and delicate designs, there is an entire complex that surrounds the mausoleum. The main building was completed in 1648, however, the surrounding architectural forms took five years for completion. The complex includes gardens, fountains, and a reflecting pool, which reflects the image of the Taj Mahal. [PAR] The white-colored tomb rests on a square plinth and comprises of a symmetrical building with an arch-shaped doorway crowned by a large dome and finial. The original finial was constructed of gold, but it was replicated by a bronze model in the early 19th century. The top of the tomb is embellished with a lotus design, mixing the Persian and the Indian architectural styles. The recherch\u00e9 inlay work and elaborate craftsmanship together with the calligraphy leaves one utterly fascinated. For the interior inlay work, Shah Jahan preferred to use precious and semi-precious stones. [PAR] Four minarets, each more than 40 meters tall, recall the traditional component of the mosques. The minarets were constructed somewhat outside the plinth to avoid damage that may occur if any minaret falls. [PAR] Passages from the Quran can be seen bedecking the walls of the entire complex. These passages refer to the day of judgement. [PAR] Over the centuries, the monument of love has been experiencing neglect and is deteriorating. During the early 20th century, a major restoration of this wonder took place. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is now in danger due to excessive pollution.

Shem's name is    generally mentioned first in the list of Noah's sons. He and his    wife were saved in the ark (7:13). Noah foretold his preeminence    over Canaan (9:23-27). He died at the age of six hundred years,    having been for many years contemporary with Abraham, according to    the usual chronology.

[PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was a dominant and controversial figure in Victorian England and the leading British statesman of the 19th century. He served in the British government from the 1830s to the 1890s, and as Prime Minister of Britain on four occasions he reformed both British government and society. [PAR] Gladstone is often viewed as the moral and political voice of the Victorian era, yet he was famously disliked by Queen Victoria . [PAR] One of Gladstone's lifelong obsessions was the \"rescuing\" of English prostitutes, and his activities in that regard made some question his motivations and even his sanity. [PAR] Early Life of Gladstone [PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was born on December 29, 1809 in Liverpool. His family was of Scottish descent, and his father, Sir John Gladstone, became a wealthy merchant in the port city of Liverpool and had investments in slave plantations in the West Indies. [PAR] After being educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, Gladstone took a trip to Italy and then returned to Britain and was elected to Parliament. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Though he would become the leader of the Liberal Party, he was first elected as a Tory. His first address in Parliament was a defense of slave owners in the West Indies, in which he used his father as an example. [PAR] Gladstone's Politics Shifted from Conservative to Liberal [PAR] In the British government Gladstone was at first aligned with Sir Robert Peel, but throughout the 1840s Gladstone\u2019s politics evolved until he began taking positions more in line with the Liberal party. A trip to Naples in the early 1850s, where he witnessed extreme poverty, may have helped drive him away from Tory orthodoxy. [PAR] In the 1850s Gladstone served as chancellor of the exchequer, the chief financial officer of the British government, and was influential in passing financial reforms, including the abolition of many taxes and tariffs. [PAR] Leader of\u00a0the Liberal Party [PAR] In the late 1850s Gladstone gravitated toward a newly formulated Liberal party and became its leader. [PAR] Gladstone's party won an overwhelming majority in the elections of 1868, and he became prime minister. He focused on reforms, which were often targeted at reducing the influence of privilege and making British institutions, such as civil service and the military, open to those beyond the privileged classes. [PAR] Gladstone and the Issue of Irish Home Rule: [PAR] Gladstone served four terms as prime minister: [PAR] 1868-1874 [PAR] 1886 [PAR] 1892-94 [PAR] During his first term as prime minister Gladstone pushed reforms intended to improve the lot of the Irish peasantry. In fact, Gladstone became intensely interested in the \"Irish question,\" and many of his ideas for reform were focused on Britain's administration of Ireland . [PAR] Gladstone, throughout the late 1800s, often advocated \"home rule\" for Ireland. While it wasn't a call for outright Irish independence, it was considered by many a radical position. [PAR] Bitter Rivalry With Benjamin Disraeli [PAR] The other leading political player in Victorian Britain was Benjamin Disraeli, who, like Gladstone, held a variety of government posts and served as Prime Minister. For decades Gladstone and Disraeli were rivals, and it is known that they detested each other.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] New ZealandNew Zealand () is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses \u2013 that of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu \u2013 and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. [PAR] Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand, and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture. In 1642, Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, became the first European to sight New Zealand.  In 1840, representatives of the British Crown and M\u0101ori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, making New Zealand a British colony. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.7 million is of European descent; the indigenous M\u0101ori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from M\u0101ori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant. [PAR] New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy. New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom and quality of life. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently John Key. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt, supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America.  In 1645, Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland.   British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand. [PAR] Aotearoa (often translated as \"land of the long white cloud\") is the current M\u0101ori name for New Zealand. It is unknown whether M\u0101ori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans, with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island. M\u0101ori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui (the fish of M\u0101ui) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) or Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki) for the South Island. Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island) and South (Stewart Island / Rakiura).  In 1830, maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907, this was the accepted norm.  The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013.

Edward's spendthrift ways had left him with many debts. [PAR] The duke and duchess, in an attempt to reduce expenses, moved with their infant daughter to a modest home. Not long after the move, Edward became ill and died of pneumonia on January 23, 1820 (Victoria was just eight months old). Six days later, King George III died as well, thus making George IV King of England. [PAR] Victoria was now third in line to the throne behind her two uncles, who had failed to produce heirs.

The rider leading a classification at the end of a stage is required to wear  the corresponding jersey during the next stage. [PAR] Jerseys  are awarded in a ceremony immediately following the stage. Where a single rider leads in the competition for more than one jersey, they  wear the most prestigious jersey to which they are entitled, and the  second-placed rider in each of the other classifications becomes entitled to  wear the corresponding jersey. [PAR] Yellow Jersey [PAR] The yellow jersey, known in French as the maillot jaune, is worn by the overall time  leader, and is the most prized jersey. It is awarded by calculating the total combined race  time up to that point for each rider. The yellow jersey was first awarded in 1919 to make the race leader stand out. The color yellow was chosen because the pages of the race sponsor's magazine,  L'Auto, were yellow. [PAR] Green Jersey [PAR] The green jersey, known in French as the maillot vert, is awarded to the cyclist with the highest number of sprint points. Points for this jersey are gained by the riders who  finish first, second, etc., at the end of each stage. The number of points for each place and the number  of riders rewarded varies depending on the type of stage as the flatter stages are more likely to result in a sprint finish. Flat stages give the  winner 35 points down to 1 point for the 25th rider; medium mountain stages  give the winner 25 points down to 1 point for the 20th rider; high mountain  stages give the winner 20 points down to 1 point for the 15th rider. Points are also awarded for  individual time trial stages: 15 for the winner down to 1 for the 10th rider. Additional points are available at intermediate sprint contests, usually  occurring 2 or 3 times in each stage at pre-determined locations; currently 6,  4 and 2 points are available to the first 3 riders at each sprint. [PAR] Polka Dot  Jersey [PAR] The  winner of the King of the Mountain wears a white jersey with red  dots (known as the maillot \u00e0 pois rouges in French), which is commonly referred to as the \"polka dot jersey\". Although the best climber was first recognized in 1933 as the \"King of the Mountain\", the distinctive  polka dot jersey was not introduced until 1975. The colors were decided by the then  sponsor, Poulain Chocolate, to match a popular product. At the top of each climb in the Tour,  there are points awarded for the riders who are first over the top. The climbs are  divided into categories, from 1  to 4  based on  their difficulty with 1 being the most difficult, measured as a function of their steepness and length. A fifth  category, called Hors categorie (outside category) is formed by  mountains even more difficult than those of the number 1 category. In 2004, the  scoring system was changed so that the first rider over a fourth category  climb was awarded 3 points while the first to complete a hors category  climb would win 20 points. Further points over a fourth category climb are only  for the top three places while on a hors category climb the top ten riders are  rewarded.
