TCP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tcp}\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is at the heart of most networks. It provides for reliable communication via a three\n\nway hand shake, breaks large data segments into packets, ensures data integrity, and provides flow control for those\n\npackets. This all comes at a cost of course, and this connection-oriented protocol typically has higher latency than its\n\ncounterparts. Given the complex nature of TCP is has often been targeted for attacks. TCP stacks are constantly adapting\n\nand changing (within the parameters of the protocol) to avoid DoS and MitM attacks.^\\[[^4]\\]^\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.3.2. UDP\"}\n\n\n### 4.3.2. UDP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__udp}\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol designed for instances where TCP may have too much latency.\n\nUDP achieves this performance boost by not having handshaking or flow control. The result is a speedy protocol that\n\nsometimes drops datagrams. UDP is often used as the basis for gaming or streaming protocols where the timing of the\n\npackets is more important that whether or not they all arrive. UDP does still employ checksums so you can be sure of the\n\nintegrity of any UDP packets that you do receive.\n\n:::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.3.3.

Tools of the Trade {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tools_of_the_trade}\nWith all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the question remains, \\\"What can be done?\\\" There\n\nare a few tools the security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture including: *user\n\nawareness*, *anti-malware software*, *backups*, and *encryption*.\n\n::: description-list\n\n[User Awareness]{.term}\n\n:   [A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform\n\n    other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure.

Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key.

{"context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1.

{"context": "### 4.4.2. HTTP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__http}\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a text based protocol that governs how web traffic moves.

Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high.

This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table.

In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

A typical request has an *method* and a *path*, such as\n\n`GET /index.html`{.literal} which would retrieve the landing page of a website. Responses have a code, message, and\n\noptionally data.

Worms, Viruses, and Trojans {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__worms_viruses_and_trojans}\nWorms are self-propagating programs that spread without user interaction. Their code is typically stored within an\n\nindependent object, such as a hidden executable file.

The worm used an unprecedented four\n\nzero-day attacks and was designed to spread via USB flash drives and Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). In this way it\n\ndidn't just rely on networks to propagate. Ultimately Stuxnet's payload targeted the code used to program PLC devices\n\nthat control motors and make them spin too fast, destroying the centrifuges. Stuxnet also employed an impressive rootkit\n\nto cover its tracks. Given the level of sophistication Stuxnet is believed to have been developed by the US and Israel.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nViruses typically require user interaction, such as copying and infected file from one machine to another, and store\n\ntheir code inside another file on a machine. An executable file may be infected by having the virus code added a\n\nseparate page that executes before the standard program code. Viruses can be quite damaging to the host as they may take\n\nsignificant resources to spread locally. The term virus is also an unfortunately overloaded one. Due to it's popularity\n\nit is often used by some lower-skill threat actors to refer to many different types of malware.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nConcept Virus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nThe Concept virus was the first example of a Microsoft Word macro virus.

Trojans\n\nare the most popular kind of malware as they can be used as an attack vector for many other payloads. The name comes\n\nfrom Greek mythology, where a Trojan horse was disguised as a gift and given to a besieged town.

IPv4 addresses can be thought of as being in two groups: static addresses and\n\ndynamic addresses. Dynamic addresses are distributed by a DHCP server for a particular lease time. When the time is up,\n\nthe DHCP server may distribute the address to another client.

These rogue DHCP servers can cause traffic\n\nto be redirected to initiate MitM attacks or cause DoS attacks.

{"context": "### 7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}\nThere are several different authorization models that can be used. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

{"context": "## Case Study: Exploiting Non-Rolling Codes\n::: content\n\nThe importance of non-repeating codes, such as the counter codes used in the CTR and GCM block cipher modes of operation\n\ncan be highlighted through analysis of another important technology that uses codes: keyless entry systems. When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes. In a case of \\\"everything old is new again\\\" this isn't true. [Blake Berry\n\n(HackingIntoYourHeart) discovered that several makes and models of cars are actually still vulnerable to a replay\n\nattack.](https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty/blob/main/README.md){.link}\n\nSammy Kamkar also discovered a vulnerablility for rolling codes, named RollJam, which he demonstrated at DEF CON 23.\n\nKamkar's device jams signals sent by a keyfob, while recording the codes being sent. Once it has two codes recorded,\n\npresumably from the victim pressing the button multiple times, it stops jamming, sends out the first code to unlock the\n\ncar and stores the second code to unlock the car at a later time.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.10.

Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

An\n\nIDS (Intrusion Detection System) may flag the queries as known SQL injection attacks. Assuming the attack makes it past\n\nthe application, team, and the IDS, it is possible that the database user is configured according to the principle of\n\nleast privilege and the queries will not be executed due to a lack of permissions.\n\nAs you can see, any one of these layers may be fail, but by having multiple layers the chance of an attack occurring is\n\ngreatly diminished.\n\n:::\n\n:::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.3.

It is often used for data validation\n\nas a relatively small hash *digest* or *signature* can demonstrate the integrity of a large block of data. Hashes can\n\nalso be used so that sensitive information does not have to be stored in cleartext. By storing a hash of a password, you\n\ncan check to see if the correct password was entered without storing the password itself. In the case of a data breach\n\nonly the hashes are leaked and the attacker does not have access to the passwords to try with other services.\n\nTwo main families of hash algorithms are used: MD5 and SHA. MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value and is still often used to\n\nverify data integrity. The algorithm is technically cryptographically broken, but you may still see it in use. The SHA\n\nfamily of algorithms consists of SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [SHA-1: 160 bits, similar to MD5, designed by the NSA, no longer approved for cryptographic use]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-2: SHA-256 and SHA-512, very common with the number indicating the block size, designed by the NSA]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-3: non-NSA designed, not widely adopted, similar numbering scheme as SHA-2 (SHA3-256, etc.)]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nDictionary based attacks against password hashes are fairly common. Typically software is used which generates a hash\n\nfor every word in the dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the compromised machine. One way to\n\ncombat this is through salting or adding random bits to each password. When salting the bits are stored with the hash.\n\nThis forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a\n\nstored table (rainbow table) of all the possible hashes. It can make attacks go from instant to days or even years\n\ndepending on the complexity of the password.\n\nAn even better way of combating attacks against hashes is through a secret salt or *pepper*. A pepper is a random value\n\nthat is added to the password but not stored with the resulting hash. The random value can be stored in a separate\n\nmedium such as a hardware Security Module.\n\n::::\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.6.

{"context": "### 4.3.3. Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host\n\nto have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and typically support a commonly used\n\nservice. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them. Lastly ports 49152 to 65535\n\nare used dynamically by applications as needed.\n\nIt is important to know some commonly used ports as the services running on these ports may be subject to an attack.\n\nWhen scanning a machine, only necessary ports should be open.\n\n:::: table\n\n:::

Exploitation\"}\n\n\n### 3.6.4. Exploitation {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__exploitation}\nTechnically the exploitation step occurs once the malware is successfully executed. In many cases, this involves almost\n\nno interaction from the attacker. Once malware is activated or the payload of an exploit executed, the *victim* has\n\ncompleted the exploitation step.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"3.6.5. Installation\"}\n\n\n### 3.6.5. Installation {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__installation}\nThe installation step is typically performed by the malware once it is running. The malware installs itself, hides\n\nitself, and sets up persistence (the ability to restart after being stopped). The malware may escalate privilege or move\n\nlaterally. It may also install second stage additional payloads from a remote server. A common tactic is injecting\n\ndownloaded code into an existing process to mask which process is performing questionable actions.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"3.6.6.

Public {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__public}\nPublic cloud infrastructure consists of providers like AWS who host huge data centers throughout the world and welcome\n\nanyone who can afford it to use their resources. Public cloud providers claim to be secure and may even allow for audits\n\n(typically through a third party) to meet compliance requests. Ultimately the security of the underlying public cloud\n\ninfrastructure lies in the hands of the provider, something that not all companies are comfortable with.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"10.2.2.

Private {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__private}\nPrivate cloud takes the virtualization and automation technologies used by public cloud providers and hosts them\n\ninternally. By utilizing technologies like [OpenStack](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/openstack){.link} a company can\n\ntake full control of their deployment and run their own cloud. This has some disadvantages for companies that may lack\n\nthe servers, space, and utilities, but for companies that were already self-hosted, migrated to the public cloud, and\n\nnow would like more control, private cloud is an excellent choice.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"10.2.3.
