[PAR] History [PAR] Homer was relying on a Christmas bonus to buy presents, but didn't get it. He was relying on this bonus because the jar of Christmas money that Marge accumulates for the family's Christmas treats was disposed of to pay for the removal of a tattoo that Bart got on his arm. Homer took the small amount of Christmas money he made working as Santa Claus at the Springfield Mall and bet it at the dog track. He had inside information on what dog was going to win, but instead bet on the \"long shot,\" Santa's Little Helper, believing his name to be a sign. Santa's Little Helper finished last (apparently, it was the latest in a long string of last-place finishes), and his frustrated owner abandoned him. Homer and Bart brought him home, and everyone was so happy with him that it was a merry Christmas after all. [1] [PAR] Snowball II , Maggie and Santa's Little Helper together for a picture [PAR] Sometimes, Santa's Little Helper can be seen chewing on the newspaper and other objects in the Simpson's household (sometimes ignored or tolerated by the family), tearing up the furniture, digging holes in the backyard and eating food from the living room table. It is stated that Homer and Santa's Little Helper's birthdays are on the same day. [2] [PAR] With a few exceptions, Santa's Little Helper doesn't make any sound that resembles a bark. However, he does have an ability to think just like a person. Once, he made a sound similar to \"chewy\", and Homer writes it down in his review, amazed that the dog spoke English. [3] He is also shown to have ridden a circus ball on his hind legs and speak the phrase 'We love... you!' in an attempt to be given some attention from the Simpson family. [4] In addition, he was mascot of Duff Beer , and was known as Suds McDuff (a reference to a similar, real life mascot Spuds MacKenzie). [5] [PAR] Santa's Little Helper licking Bart [PAR] Santa's Little Helper's life with the Simpsons is not always easy. Due to his disobedience and destructive behavior nearly caused the Simpson family to give him away, but he passed an obedience class, thus he could stay. [6] Santa's Little Helper almost passed away from gastric torsion (referred to in the show as a \"twisting of the stomach\") because Homer initially couldn't afford $750 for the required operation. [7] He also broke two legs when Bart's treehouse was demolished by Mr. Burns ' slanted oil well drill (The latter of which caused Bart Simpson to hate Mr. Burns immensely). [8] Santa's Little Helper is sometimes a bad dog. [PAR] At one time, Santa's Little Helper was shortly abandoned by Bart for Laddie , a purebred and very well-trained dog he bought from a mail-order catalog together with various other expensive gifts and gadgets. To do that, Bart used a credit card he applied for under the name of his dog, yet the credit card company misread the form and issued a card to Mr. \"Santos L. Halper\". Laddie learned many tricks that Santa's Little Helper was completely unable to perform (most notably a back flip, CPR and using a toilet). The Simpson family nearly forgot about their old pet, and Bart eventually gave him away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tried to get Santa's Little Helper back. When he finally found him, Santa's Little Helper was serving as a guide dog for a blind man named Mr. Mitchell, but eventually chose to return to his former owner, Bart.

Together they had ten illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname FitzClarence. [PAR] Early life [PAR] She was born Dorothea (sometimes called Dorothy or Dora) Bland near Waterford, Ireland, the daughter of Francis Bland (d. 1778) and his mistress, Grace Phillips. She was the paternal granddaughter of Nathaneal Bland (d. 1760), Vicar General of Ardfert and Aghada, and Judge of the Prerogative Court of Dublin, Ireland, and his wife Lucy (n\u00e9e Heaton). [PAR] In 1774, when she was 13, Dorothea's father, who worked as a stagehand, abandoned the family to marry an Irish actress. Though he continued to support the family by sending them meagre sums of money, they were poor and Dorothea had to go to work to help support her four siblings. Her mother, an actress by profession, saw potential in Dorothea and put her on the stage. [PAR] Stage life and early relationships [PAR] She became a famous actress of the day and was said to have the most beautiful legs ever seen on the stage. Audiences enjoyed her performances in breeches roles. She assumed the name \"Mrs. Jordan\", because it was slightly more respectable for a married woman to be on the stage. In fact, there was no \"Mr. Jordan\" and Dorothea Bland never married. Some sources state that the name and title were taken to conceal an early pregnancy. She had an affair with her first boss, Richard Daly, the manager of the Theatre Royal, Cork, who was married, and had an illegitimate daughter, Frances (b. 1782 Dublin), at age 20. [PAR] In England, she had a short lived affair with an army Lieutenant, Charles Doyne, who proposed marriage. But she turned him down and went to work for the theatre company operated by Tate Wilkinson. It was at this point she adopted the name \"Mrs. Jordan\" \u2013 a reference to her escape across the Irish Sea, likened to the River Jordan. [PAR] Shortly after her affair with Wilkinson was over, she began an affair with George Inchbald, the male lead in the Wilkinson company. According to Claire Tomalin, Dorothea's biographer, Dorothea would have married Inchbald, so greatly was she in love with him, but that he never asked. Broken-hearted, she left him in 1786 to begin an affair with Sir Richard Ford, a police magistrate and a lawyer. She moved in with Ford when he promised to marry her. They had three children, a short lived son and two daughters. She left him to begin her affair with the Duke of Clarence, once she realised that Ford was never going to marry her. [PAR] Relationship with William IV [PAR] Pretty, witty and intelligent, Jordan soon came to the attention of wealthy men. She became the mistress of William, Duke of Clarence, later King William IV, in 1791, living with him at Bushy House, and seemed to have not bothered herself with politics or the political intrigues that often went on behind the scenes in royal courts.

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry. With no reserves, Tallard's line broke and his troops began fleeing towards H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. They were joined in their flight by the Bavarians from Lutzingen. [PAR] Trapped in Blenheim, Cl\u00e9rambault's men continued the fight until 9:00 PM when over 10,000 of them surrendered. As the French fled southwest, a group of Hessian troops managed to capture Marshall Tallard, who was to spend the next seven years in captivity in England. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Aftermath & Impact: [PAR] In the fighting at Blenheim, the Allies lost 4,542 killed and 7,942 wounded, while the French and Bavarians suffered approximately 20,000 killed and wounded as well as 14,190 captured. The Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim ended the French threat to Vienna and removed the aura of invincibility that surrounded the armies of Louis XIV.

The Devil\u2019s Coach Horse belongs to the Rove Beetle family, called the Staphylinidae which are sometimes referred to as the \u2018Staphs\u2019 for short. There are approximately 1000 species of rove beetle (given this name as they are constantly on the move) found in the UK which amounts to roughly a quarter of all British beetles.    \u00a0 [PAR] Read more [PAR] The Devil\u2019s Coach Horse is the largest of the rove beetles and can reach a length of around 28mm. Typical to this family, the Devil\u2019s Coach Horse is a long-bodied, uniformly black beetle with an extended exposed powerful abdomen with shortened wing cases (elytra). Although able to fly its wings are rarely used. [PAR] The beetle is common in the UK and is found throughout Europe. It also inhabits parts of Australasia and the Americas but it is not native to these areas having been introduced. [PAR] The Devil\u2019s Coach Horse occupies a wide range of habitats requiring damp conditions and is common in woods, hedgerows, meadows, parks and gardens, being seen between April and October. It is also known to make its way indoors now and then, particularly in older properties. [PAR] 3,2,1....Fight! [PAR] If you have crossed paths with the Devil\u2019s Coach Horse you may have seen it adopt its typical defensive pose where it raises the rear end of its body and opens its fierce jaws, similar to that of a scorpion. A tad on the aggressive side perhaps but it is only because its feeling threatened! If it continues to feel threatened though it can emit a foul smell from its abdomen area (\u2018olens\u2019 meaning smell) via a pair of white glands; can excrete an unpleasant fluid from its mouth and rear; and it\u2019s fair to say that its bite may hurt a little! [PAR] Jaws of the invertebrate world [PAR] During the day the Devil\u2019s Coach Horse usually rests amongst and under stones and logs but it is at night that this carnivorous, nocturnal predator comes out to feed on slugs, worms, spiders, woodlice, a range of other invertebrates and carrion (dead items). [PAR] For its size the Devil\u2019s Coach Horse has very large jaws (mandibles) which it uses to catch and cut its prey. With the help of its front legs the food is then turned into a ball like shape (bolus) which is chewed, passing through the beetles\u2019 digestive system a number of times until it becomes liquefied and finally digested. [PAR] Little Devils - carnivorous young that live underground.. [PAR] Devil\u2019s Coach Horse mate in autumn and a female will lay a single egg two to three weeks later in a damp, dark habitat such as leaf litter or moss. After around 30 days the larva will emerge, living mainly underground. As with their parents, Devil\u2019s Coach Horse larvae are carnivorous feeding on a variety of other invertebrates; possess powerful jaws to catch and consume their prey; and can even adopt the threatened display of a raised tail and open jaws.

When Winston Churchill formed his World War II coalition government (May 1940), Macmillan, who had bitterly condemned British \u201cappeasement\u201d of Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Supply. After 10 months as colonial under secretary, he was sent (Dec. 30, 1942) to northwest Africa as British minister resident at Allied Forces Headquarters, Mediterranean Command.

Macmillan worked to improve British-U.S. relations, which had been strained by the Suez crisis, and his old partnership with General, now President, Eisenhower was helpful in this regard. Macmillan himself supervised the conduct of foreign policy as prime minister. He had several conferences with presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy , and he visited Nikita S. Khrushchev in Moscow (February 1959). At home, Macmillan gave firm support to Britain\u2019s array of postwar social programs. He led the Conservative Party to a resounding victory in the 1959 general election by effectively contrasting Britain\u2019s prewar unemployment with its postwar full employment under the slogan \u201cYou\u2019ve never had it so good.\u201d [PAR] Britannica Stories [PAR] Ringling Bros.

Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999.

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. [PAR] Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623.

He imposed wage and price controls for a period of ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was reelected by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history in 1972, when he defeated George McGovern. [PAR] The year 1973 saw an Arab oil embargo, gasoline rationing, and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal. The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In retirement, Nixon's work writing several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.  [PAR] Early life  [PAR] Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, in a house his father built. He was the son of Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith; Nixon's upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time, such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909\u201333), Donald (1914\u201387), Arthur (1918\u201325), and Edward (born 1930). Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary England; Richard, for example, was named after Richard the Lionheart.  [PAR] Nixon's early life was marked by hardship, and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood: \"We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it\". The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved to Whittier, California. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station. Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness. At the age of twelve, Richard was found to have a spot on his lung and, with a family history of tuberculosis, he was forbidden to play sports.

[PAR] Since those early days the course and fences have undergone many changes. Most recently the wooden stakes at the core of the fences have been replaced with flexible plastic to reduce the risk of horses and jockeys getting injured. The starting line has also moved further away from the main stand as this helps the horses remain calmer in the moments before the off. [PAR] These changes haven\u2019t effected the essence of the race, which still remains the one of the toughest\u00a0tests of horse and rider in the world. Forty horses line up at the starting tape and around 60% of the entrants will not complete the race, which is four and a half miles\u00a0long and has thirty fence jumps. [PAR] Aintree [PAR] Aintree\u00a0is the home of the Grand National and apart from a couple of years during the first world war, the race has always taken place at the course, which is located just five miles from the centre of Liverpool. Well served by public transport and a train station, the course is modern and offers a wide range of facilities. The Grand National is just one of many race\u00a0meetings that take place during the National Hunt season although not all meetings and races are run over the National course. [PAR] Getting to Aintree is very easy from all parts of the United Kingdom. Liverpool has excellent rail links, motorway access\u00a0and is served by John Lennon Airport. Queues on the day of the Grand National can build up on the roads surrounding the course but this is to be expected for such a popular sporting occasion. Around 70,000 racing fans will\u00a0watch the race live making it one of the biggest sporting events in the calendar. [PAR] Course [PAR] The Grand National course is 4 miles and 4 furlongs long. The horses encounter 16 different fences\u00a0with varying degrees of height and width. Riders must navigate two circuits of the course (missing out fences 15 & 16 on the second circuit)\u00a0before turning for\u00a0the home straight which is the longest run-in of any UK racecourse. [PAR] The Grand National is the longest race in the UK but it\u2019s the difficulty for the fences that provide the real challenge\u00a0to horse and rider. Just a\u00a0mention of the fences Becher\u2019s Brook, The Chair and the Canal Turn make a jockey\u2019s blood run cold. [PAR] Often called the \u2018Original Extreme Sport\u2019\u00a0steeplechase races originated in Ireland. Legend has it that the\u00a0first race\u00a0was\u00a0between Cornelius O\u2019Callaghan and Edmund Blake as they raced from\u00a0Buttevant Church to St. Leger Church, or from steeple to steeple, hence the term steeplechase. Those original cross country races are now replicated on racecourses across England and Ireland. However, the Aintree course is arguably the toughest of all. Jockeys\u00a0no longer have to jump a stone wall at Aintree or cross the ploughed field, but the water jumps, brooks and ditches still feature on many of its\u00a0fences.

The narrator of the novel is Ishmael , a sailor on the Pequod who undertakes the journey out of his affection for the sea. [PAR] Moby Dick begins with Ishmael's arrival in New Bedford as he travels toward Nantucket. He rests at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, where he meets Queequeg , a harpooner from New Zealand who will also sail on the Pequod. Although Queequeg appears dangerous, he and Ishmael must share a bed together and the narrator quickly grows fond of the somewhat uncivilized harpooner. Queequeg is actually the son of a High Chief who left New Zealand because of his desire to learn among Christians. The next day, Ishmael attends a church service and listens to a sermon by Father Mapple , a renowned preacher who delivers a sermon considering Jonah and the whale that concludes that the tale is a lesson to preacher Truth in the face of Falsehood. [PAR] On a schooner to Nantucket, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a local bumpkin who mocks Queequeg. However, when this bumpkin is swept overboard, Queequeg saves him. In Nantucket, Queequeg and Ishmael choose between three ships for a year journey, and decide upon the Pequod. The Captain of the Pequod, Peleg , is now retired, and merely owns the boat with another Quaker, Bildad . Peleg tells them of the new captain, Ahab, and immediately describes him as a grand and ungodly man. Before leaving for their voyage, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a stranger named Elijah who predicts disaster on their journey. Before leaving on the Pequod, Elijah again predicts disaster. [PAR] Ishmael and Queequeg board the Pequod, where Captain Ahab is still unseen, secluded in his own cabin. Peleg and Bildad consult with Starbuck , the first mate. He is a Quaker and a Nantucket native who is quite practical. The second mate is Stubb , a Cape Cod native with a more jovial and carefree attitude. The third is Flask , a Martha's Vineyard native with a pugnacious attitude. Melville introduces the rest of the crew, including the Indian harpooner Tashtego , the African harpooner Daggoo . [PAR] Several days into the voyage, Ahab finally appears as a man seemingly made of bronze who stands on an ivory leg fashioned from whalebone. He eventually gets into a violent argument with Stubb when the second mate makes a joke at Ahab's expense, and kicks him. This leads Stubb to dream of kicking Ahab's ivory leg off, but Flask claims that the kick from Ahab is a sign of honor. [PAR] At last, Ahab tells the crew of the Pequod to look for a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow: Moby Dick, the legendary whale that took Ahab's leg. Starbuck tells Ahab that his obsession with Moby Dick is madness, but Ahab claims that all things are masks and there is some unknown reasoning behind that mask that man must strike through. For Ahab, Moby Dick is that mask. Ahab himself seems to recognize his own madness. Starbuck begins to worry that the ship is overmatched by the mad captain and knows that he will see an impious end to Ahab. [PAR] While Queequeg and Ishmael weave a sword-mat for lashing to their boat, the Pequod soon comes upon a whale and Ahab orders his crew to their boats. Ahab orders his special crew, which Ishmael compares to \"phantoms,\" to their boats. The crew attacks a whale and Queequeg does strike it, but this is insufficient to kill it. Among the \"phantoms\" in the boat is Fedallah , a sinister Parsee. [PAR] After passing the Cape of Good Hope, the Pequod comes across the Goney (Albatross), another ship on its voyage.

Many of these changes to city names were done to make those names reflect the linguistic systems in the various areas. [PAR] The following is a brief history of some of India's most famous name changes: [PAR] Mumbai vs. Bombay [PAR] Mumbai is one of the world's ten largest cities today and is located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. This world-class city wasn't always known by this name however. Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay, which has its origins in the 1600s with the Portuguese. During their colonization of the area, they began calling it Bombaim - Portuguese for \"Good Bay.\" In 1661 though, this Portuguese colony was given to King Charles II of England after he married the Portuguese princess Catherine de Braganza. When the British then took control of the colony, its name became Bombay- an anglicized version of Bombaim. [PAR] The name Bombay then stuck until 1996 when the Indian government changed it to Mumbai. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] It is believed that this was the name of a Kolis settlement in the same area because many Kolis communities were named after their Hindu deities. By the early 20th Century, one of these settlements was named Mumbadevi for a goddess of the same name. [PAR] Therefore the change to the name of Mumbai in 1996 was an attempt to use the previous Hindi names for a city that was once controlled by the British. The use of the name Mumbai reached a global scale in 2006 when the Associated Press announced it would refer to what was once Bombay as Mumbai. [PAR] Chennai vs. Madras [PAR] However, Mumbai was not the only newly named Indian city in 1996. In August of that same year, the former city of Madras, located in the state of Tamil Nadu, had its name changed to Chennai. [PAR] Both the names Chennai and Madras date back to 1639. In that year, the Raja of Chandragiri, (a suburb in South India), allowed the British East India Company to build a fort near the town of Madraspattinam. At the same time, the local people built another town close to the site of the fort. This town was named Chennappatnam, after the father of one of the early rulers. Later, both the fort and the town grew together but the British shortened their colony's name to Madras while the Indians changed theirs to Chennai. [PAR] The name Madras (shortened from Madraspattinam) also has links to the Portuguese who were present in the area as early as the 1500s. Their exact impact on the naming of the area is unclear however and many rumors exist as to how the name really originated. Many historians believe that it may have come from the Madeiros family who lived there in the 1500s. [PAR] No matter where it originated though, Madras is a much older name than Chennai. Despite that fact, the city was still renamed Chennai because it is in the language of the area\u2019s original inhabitants and Madras was seen as being a Portuguese name and/or was associated with the former British colony. [PAR] Kolkata vs. Calcutta [PAR] More recently, in January 2001, one of the world's 25 largest cities, Calcutta, became Kolkata. At the same time the city\u2019s name changed, its state changed from West Bengal to Bangla as well. Like Madras, the origin of the name Kolkata is disputed.

[PAR] Etymology [PAR] Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).   This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.  [PAR] Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.

The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time.

When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice.

That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. [PAR] Image via Fred Espenak [PAR] Deneb is one of the most distant stars you will see with your eye alone. That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The exact distance to Deneb is unclear, with estimates ranging from about 1,425 light-years to perhaps as much as 7,000 light-years. Whatever its exact distance, when you gaze at Deneb, know that you are gazing across thousands of light-years of space. [PAR] The best estimates for Deneb\u2019s distance likely are those obtained by the Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission in the 1990s. A simple calculation from initial Hipparcos data gives the figure of 3,230 light-years, whereas the refined data yield just over 1,400 light-years. At any of these estimates distances, Deneb is one of the farthest stars the unaided human eye can see. It is so far, that the light that reaches the Earth today started on its journey well more than 1,000 years ago. [PAR] Deneb (bottom half of frame) is 200 times bigger than the sun. Image via AstroBob [PAR] In order for us to see it at its enormous distance, Deneb must also be tremendously bright and energetic. Among the 20 brightest stars, only Rigel in Orion surpasses Deneb in intrinsic brightness. Deneb is an A2Ia star, which says that it is white hot (A2) and a supergiant star (Ia). Prof. James Kaler, using the figure of 2,600 light years as the distance, estimated a diameter 200 times greater than our sun, and about a quarter of a million times brighter in visible light. Considering its spectral classification (A2), Deneb must have a surface temperature between about 8500 to 9000 kelvins (roughly 14,800 to 15,700 degrees F). [PAR] This is the famous Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, which shows the luminosities of stars.  See Deneb at the top of the diagram?  It is one of the most luminous stars known. [PAR] Deneb is not the biggest star in the Milky Way. Betelgeuse and Antares , among others, are larger. But Deneb may well be the most energetic (based on the amount of electromagnetic radiation it produces) of the A-type stars. The famed North American nebula, a large cloud of glowing gas in the shape of the continent, likely is glowing in a process similar to fluorescence, energized by the radiation of Deneb. [PAR] Stellar luminosity: The true brightnesses of stars [PAR] How to see it [PAR] White Deneb is the 20th brightest star in the sky. It is one of the most remote stars visible to the eye alone. You can gaze at this faraway star starting in late spring, when Deneb rises over the northeastern horizon by mid-evening. A month later, Deneb is already in the sky by the time it gets dark. In standard time, the midnight culmination date is about August 1. Using Daylight Time, the midnight culmination is about August 15. The word \u2018culmination\u2019 indicates the star\u2019s highest point in the sky. [PAR] Deneb is part of several famous star patterns, which overlap each other. It\u2019s the brightest of the stars composing the constellation Cygnus the Swan, where it marks the Swan\u2019s Tail. When you hear \u2018deneb\u2019 in a star name, it always means \u2018tail.\u2019 Simultaneously, Deneb marks the head of an asterism (a readily recognizable grouping of stars that is not an official constellation), known as the Northern Cross. Plus it is one of the three stars known as the Summer Triangle . The other two stars are Vega and Altair .

Before attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Harry routinely stayed in his bedroom with Hedwig, away from the Dursleys , since she was his only friend at 4 Privet Drive . [4] Throughout her life, Hedwig provided Harry with mail service, as well as loyal companionship. Hedwig often showed Harry her affection by gently nibbling his ears and fingers, and seemed fully capable of understanding his wishes (as she faithfully followed Harry's orders to peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger until they responded to him). [PAR] Hedwig with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley [PAR] Hedwig was also highly intelligent, as she flew to France completely of her own accord while Hermione was on holiday there with her parents, just to ensure that Harry received a gift from her for his thirteenth birthday, later arriving at the Leaky Cauldron shortly after Harry stormed out of Privet Drive after a particularly bad argument despite the fact that she had been away and allegedly staying with the Weasleys when Harry left the Dursleys. According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions.

The escape from the court changes the characters and creates a space of sexual freedom and chaos, where women take control and men learn lessons in romance. In the comedies, the forest becomes a distorted version of the court where social rules are broken, creating a sense of jovial confusion before a return to civilisation in the final act. [PAR] \u2018Gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time [PAR] carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\u2019 Act 1.1 [PAR] The forest can be defined as a 'pastoral space\u2019 that represents the opposite of urban life in the play, representing the division between the city and the country that was beginning to emerge in Shakespeare\u2019s time. The country was often seen as a place of nostalgia for a simpler time, as shown in Duke Senior\u2019s forest court that echoes tales of Robin Hood. The merry court of the forest is an inversion of the court at the beginning of the play, far from the threats of violence and cruel treatment of Duke Frederick. Danger in the forest of As You Like It is never truly life-threatening but, when considering the role of the forest in other plays such as Titus Andronicus, the possibility of violence draws a long shadow over the plot. [PAR] 'Alas, what danger will it be to us, [PAR] Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\u2019 Act 1.3 [PAR] When Rosalind and Celia decide to enter the forest, they must put on disguises as 'beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\u2019 (1.3) The threat of displaying beauty is underscored by the reputation forests had during Shakespeare\u2019s time as spaces where vagrants lived outside society, presenting a danger of sexual violence for women who wandered there alone. For wealthy women, such as Rosalind and Celia, the threat would be even more pronounced as they would be visibly affluent in a place of extreme poverty, fuelling Celia\u2019s decision to dress in 'poor and mean attire\u2019.

By leaving the court she leaves behind the pressures of being a noblewoman and is able to express her desire for Orlando, albeit while dressed as a man. That Rosalind must cross-dress in order to express her desires is evidence that the forest can only allow so much freedom: the woman may take control, but only while others believe she is male. Rosalind engages with Orlando in a way that can be seen as homoerotic, creating both the sexual and gender confusion that permeates the forest. Her disguise frees her from womanhood but entraps her in masculinity, meaning she cannot marry Orlando unless she returns to presenting as female.

It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used to refer to actions of the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\".  [PAR] The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban  and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico  in 1829. [PAR] Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.

In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. [PAR] The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Last of the Summer WineLast of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke that was originally broadcast on the BBC. Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series. Last of the Summer Wine inspired other adaptations, including a television prequel,  several novelisations,  and stage adaptations.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] NATO phonetic alphabetThe International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet and also known as the ICAO radiotelephonic, phonetic or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet. Although often called \"phonetic alphabets\", spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel. [PAR] The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot,  Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu. [PAR] International adoption [PAR] After the phonetic alphabet was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  (see history below) it was adopted by many other international and national organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). [PAR] It is a subset of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which originally included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound signals by whistle, siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases.  The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...).  In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages. [PAR] NATO [PAR] A common name for this spelling alphabet, \"NATO phonetic alphabet,\" exists because it appears in Allied Tactical Publication ATP-1, Volume II: Allied Maritime Signal and Maneuvering Book used by all allied navies of NATO, which adopted a modified form of the International Code of Signals. Because the latter allows messages to be spelled via flags or Morse code, it naturally named the code words used to spell out messages by voice its \"phonetic alphabet\". The name NATO phonetic alphabet became widespread because the signals used to facilitate the naval communications and tactics of NATO have become global.  [PAR] However, ATP-1 is marked NATO Confidential (or the lower NATO Restricted) so it is not available publicly. Nevertheless, a NATO unclassified version of the document is provided to foreign, even hostile, militaries, even though they are not allowed to make it available publicly. The spelling alphabet is now also defined in other unclassified international military documents.  [PAR] The NATO alphabet appeared in some United States Air Force Europe publications during the Cold War. A particular example was the Ramstein Air Base, Telephone Directory published between 1969 and 1973 (currently out of print). The American and NATO versions had differences and the translation was provided as a convenience. Differences included Alfa, Bravo and Able, Baker for the first two letters. [PAR] History [PAR] The ICAO developed this system in the 1950s in order to account for discrepancies that might arise in communications as a result of multiple alphabet naming systems coexisting in different places and organizations.  [PAR] In the official   version of the alphabet, the non-English spellings Alfa and Juliett are used.

The scriptwriters included the Andersons, Alan Fennell, and Dennis Spooner. Barry Gray composed the music, and Derek Meddings served as special effects director. [PAR] Stingray was the first Supermarionation production in which the marionette characters had interchangeable heads featuring a variety of expressions. It was also the first British television series to be filmed entirely in colour over its production run. [PAR] Plot [PAR] Stingray, a highly sophisticated combat submarine built for speed and manoeuvrability, is the flag vessel of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a security organisation based at Marineville in the year 2065.  It is capable of speeds of up to 600 kn, while advanced pressure compensators allow it to submerge to depths of over 36000 ft, enabling cruising to the bottom of any part of any of the Earth's oceans. Marineville is located somewhere in California, on the West Coast of the United States. In the case of it being under attack, battle stations is sounded and all the buildings and vehicles are sent down on hydraulic jacks into the safety of underground bunkers, protected by enormous steel and concrete shutters whilst missiles are deployed from underground silos and fighter jets are launched. The base lies 10 mi inland, and Stingray is launched from \"Pen 3\" through a tunnel leading to the Pacific Ocean. The alerts \"action stations\", \"launch stations\", and \"battle stations\" are sounded by a rapid drum-beat (composed and recorded by series composer Barry Gray) that is played over Marineville's public address system. Commands given by radio are acknowledged with the acronym: P.W.O.R. which stands for, \"Proceeding With Orders Received\". [PAR] The pilot of Stingray is the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest (whose Supermarionation puppet was modelled on actor James Garner). He is paired with Dixie navigator Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed \"Phones\" for his role as Stingray's hydrophone operator. (Phones' real name, George Sheridan, is referred to in the series' publicity material but is not mentioned on-screen.) Troy and Phones board Stingray by sitting on twin injector seats in Marineville's stand-by lounge, which are sent down rapidly into the vessel through injector tubes and clamped down into place. They answer to the crusty \"hoverchair\"-bound Commander Samuel Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, is enamoured of Troy. The reason for Shore's disability is revealed in the episode \"The Ghost of the Sea\": as a security agent for a deep-sea mining platform, he was injured when a hostile submersible attacked the facility and damaged his patrol craft. He managed to ram the enemy in return, and then escape to the surface, but in so doing lost the use of his legs. Sub-Lieutenant John Horatio Fisher also regularly takes shifts in the Marineville control room. [PAR] During the course of the series, Stingray encounters a number of undersea races, both friendly and hostile. The Aquaphibians, an aquatic warrior race, appear regularly\u2014usually under the command of King Titan (modelled on Laurence Olivier), who is the tyrannical ruler of the underwater city of Titanica. In the pilot episode, Stingray is attacked by Titan's forces and Troy and Phones are captured. They are rescued by Titan's slave girl, Marina (modelled on Brigitte Bardot),  a mute young woman who can breathe underwater.

[PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was a dominant and controversial figure in Victorian England and the leading British statesman of the 19th century. He served in the British government from the 1830s to the 1890s, and as Prime Minister of Britain on four occasions he reformed both British government and society. [PAR] Gladstone is often viewed as the moral and political voice of the Victorian era, yet he was famously disliked by Queen Victoria . [PAR] One of Gladstone's lifelong obsessions was the \"rescuing\" of English prostitutes, and his activities in that regard made some question his motivations and even his sanity. [PAR] Early Life of Gladstone [PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was born on December 29, 1809 in Liverpool. His family was of Scottish descent, and his father, Sir John Gladstone, became a wealthy merchant in the port city of Liverpool and had investments in slave plantations in the West Indies. [PAR] After being educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, Gladstone took a trip to Italy and then returned to Britain and was elected to Parliament. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Though he would become the leader of the Liberal Party, he was first elected as a Tory. His first address in Parliament was a defense of slave owners in the West Indies, in which he used his father as an example. [PAR] Gladstone's Politics Shifted from Conservative to Liberal [PAR] In the British government Gladstone was at first aligned with Sir Robert Peel, but throughout the 1840s Gladstone\u2019s politics evolved until he began taking positions more in line with the Liberal party. A trip to Naples in the early 1850s, where he witnessed extreme poverty, may have helped drive him away from Tory orthodoxy. [PAR] In the 1850s Gladstone served as chancellor of the exchequer, the chief financial officer of the British government, and was influential in passing financial reforms, including the abolition of many taxes and tariffs. [PAR] Leader of\u00a0the Liberal Party [PAR] In the late 1850s Gladstone gravitated toward a newly formulated Liberal party and became its leader. [PAR] Gladstone's party won an overwhelming majority in the elections of 1868, and he became prime minister. He focused on reforms, which were often targeted at reducing the influence of privilege and making British institutions, such as civil service and the military, open to those beyond the privileged classes. [PAR] Gladstone and the Issue of Irish Home Rule: [PAR] Gladstone served four terms as prime minister: [PAR] 1868-1874 [PAR] 1886 [PAR] 1892-94 [PAR] During his first term as prime minister Gladstone pushed reforms intended to improve the lot of the Irish peasantry. In fact, Gladstone became intensely interested in the \"Irish question,\" and many of his ideas for reform were focused on Britain's administration of Ireland . [PAR] Gladstone, throughout the late 1800s, often advocated \"home rule\" for Ireland. While it wasn't a call for outright Irish independence, it was considered by many a radical position. [PAR] Bitter Rivalry With Benjamin Disraeli [PAR] The other leading political player in Victorian Britain was Benjamin Disraeli, who, like Gladstone, held a variety of government posts and served as Prime Minister. For decades Gladstone and Disraeli were rivals, and it is known that they detested each other. [PAR] The two men came from very opposite backgrounds, and while they were both highly intelligent, they often battled on opposite sides of an issue. And they also had different relationships with Queen Victoria, who liked Disraeli and complained bitterly of Gladstone's attitude toward her. [PAR] Gladstone's Attacks on Disraeli Were Effective [PAR] Gladstone was opposed to Britain's imperial foreign policy. And in the late 1870s, while out of power, he published a controversial pamphlet attacking the foreign policy of Benjamin Disraeli , who was the current prime minister.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] James BondThe James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. [PAR] The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of , there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.  There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). [PAR] The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0...

[PAR] On his first day at school Bernard crossed swords with caretaker Norman Potter (Deryck Guyler), a former Desert Rat with delusions of grandeur, although with some credibility as he was the right hand man of incompetent headmaster, Maurice Cromwell (Noel Howlett), who in turn was the subject of infatuation by formidable deputy head Doris Ewell (Joan Sanderson). This trio virtually ran the school much to the resignation of the rest of the disillusioned staff and the last thing they wanted to disturb the balance was a young schoolmaster fresh out of teachers training college and full of bright ideals about modern teaching. [PAR] In order to curb Bernard's na\u00efve enthusiasm it was conspired between the trio to give him a class of 'no-hopers', namely 5C. In their last year at school the pupils of this class were an uneducable bunch of delinquents who were simply biding their time until the final bell sounded on the last day of term. This of course did not involve participating in any school activities such as lessons. However, through a series of (comical) events Bernard managed to win over not only the staff but also the class of pupils (who nicknamed him 'Privet' Hedges) that contained 'hard case' Patrick Duffy (Peter Cleall), the tough talking but wimpish Frankie (Hank) Abbott (David Barry), slow witted Dennis Dunstable (Peter Denyer), flirtatious Sharon (Penny Spencer in the first two season's, Carol Hawkins thereafter), and Maureen (Liz Gebhart), who had a crush on her teacher. Support on the teacher front came from Richard Davies who gave a first class performance as the down to earth no-nonsense Welsh science teacher, Mr Price, and the aging Eric Chitty as Mr Smith, a teacher that was clearly beyond retirement age at the series outset. In fact most of the actors who played the students were already in their twenties when Please Sir! began in 1968 and two years later (at the end of the longest last year in school history) the pupils were clearly showing their age. [PAR] The series made stars of several actors although oddly none of the students found lasting television fame. LWT Head of Light Entertainment, Frank Muir, cast Alderton as Bernard Hedges after he had spotted him as a teacher in the opening episode of Never A Cross Word. After leaving Fenn Street School the actor went on to several successful series such as Upstairs, Downstairs, it's spin-off series Thomas and Sarah, the LWT sitcom No-Honestly and a series of Wodehouse plays (Wodehouse Playhouse) for BBC (all of which Alderton co-starred alongside his wife, Pauline Collins), and the BBC sitcom My Wife Next Door with Hannah Gordon. Joan Sanderson won television immortality as Mrs Richards, the hotel guest with hearing problems in Fawlty Towers and after Please Sir! had finished she teamed up again with Deryck Guyler (who was originally cast as Fenn Street's headmaster) on a BBC radio show (also penned by the same writers), You're Only Young Once.

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry. With no reserves, Tallard's line broke and his troops began fleeing towards H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. They were joined in their flight by the Bavarians from Lutzingen. [PAR] Trapped in Blenheim, Cl\u00e9rambault's men continued the fight until 9:00 PM when over 10,000 of them surrendered. As the French fled southwest, a group of Hessian troops managed to capture Marshall Tallard, who was to spend the next seven years in captivity in England.

Much of the planning for the revolution took place outside the country, in places like Angola, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique.

It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used to refer to actions of the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\".  [PAR] The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban  and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico  in 1829. [PAR] Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.

In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. [PAR] The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it.

The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931\u00a0BC, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. [PAR] According to the Talmud, Solomon is one of the 48 prophets.  In the Qur'an, he is considered a major prophet, and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman, son of David.  Solomon (Arabic \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 Sulaym\u0101n) was, according to the Qur'an, a king of ancient Israel as well as the son of David. The Qur'an recognizes Solomon as a prophet and a divinely-appointed monarch. Islamic tradition generally holds that Solomon was the third king of Israel and was a just and wise ruler for the nation.  [PAR] The Hebrew Bible credits him as the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem. It portrays him as great in wisdom, wealth, and power beyond any of the previous kings of the country, but ultimately as a human king who sinned. His sins included idolatry and turning away from Yahweh, and led to the kingdom's being torn in two during the reign of his son Rehoboam.  Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends, most notably in the 1st-century apocryphal work known as the Testament of Solomon. In later years, in mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.  [PAR] Biblical account [PAR] Childhood [PAR] Solomon was born in Jerusalem,  the second born child to David and his wife Bathsheba, widow of Uriah the Hittite. The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died before Solomon was conceived as a punishment by Yahweh on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers through Bathsheba, Nathan, Shammua, and Shobab,  besides six known older half-brothers through as many mothers.

The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.\" [PAR] While David was in this state, court factions were maneuvering for power. David's heir apparent, Adonijah, acted to have himself declared king, but was outmaneuvered by Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan, who convinced David to proclaim Solomon king according to his earlier promise, despite Solomon being younger than his brothers. [PAR] Solomon, as instructed by David, began his reign with an extensive purge, including his father's chief general, Joab, among others, and further consolidated his position by appointing friends throughout the administration, including in religious positions as well as in civic and military posts. [PAR] Solomon greatly expanded his military strength, especially the cavalry and chariot arms. He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts. [PAR] Trade relationships were a focus of his administration.

If the skin of a typical 150-pound (68-kilogram) adult male were stretched out flat, it would cover about 2 square yards (1.7 square meters) and weigh about 9 pounds (4 kilograms). Our skin protects the network of muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and everything else inside our bodies. Our eyelids have the thinnest skin, the soles of our feet the thickest.

Hair grows more quickly in summer than winter, and more slowly at night than during the day. [PAR] Like hair, nails are a type of modified skin. Nails protect the sensitive tips of fingers and toes. Human nails aren't necessary for living, but they do provide support for the tips of the fingers and toes, protect them from injury, and aid in picking up small objects. Without them, we'd have a hard time scratching an itch or untying a knot. Nails can be an indicator of a person's general health, and illness often affects their growth. [PAR] continue [PAR] Skin Basics [PAR] Skin is essential in many ways. It forms a barrier that prevents harmful substances and microorganisms from entering the body. It protects body tissues against injury. It also controls the loss of life-sustaining fluids like blood and water, helps regulate body temperature through perspiration (sweating), and protects from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays. [PAR] Without the nerve cells in skin, people couldn't feel warmth, cold, or other sensations. For instance, goosebumps form when the erector pili muscles contract to make hairs on the skin stand up straight when someone is cold, excited,\u00a0or frightened \u2014 the blood vessels keep the body from losing heat by narrowing as much as possible and keeping the warm blood away from the skin's surface, offering insulation and protection. [PAR] Every square inch of skin contains thousands of cells and hundreds of sweat glands, oil glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels. Skin is made up of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous tissue. [PAR] The upper layer of our skin, the epidermis, is the tough, protective outer layer. It's about as thick as a sheet of paper over most parts of the body. The epidermis has four layers of cells that are constantly flaking off and being renewed. In these four layers are three special types of cells: [PAR] Melanocytes produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. All people have roughly the same number of melanocytes; the more melanin that is produced, the darker the skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the production of melanin, which is why people get suntanned or freckled. [PAR] Keratinocytes produce keratin, a type of protein that is a basic component of hair, skin, nails, and helps create an intact barrier. [PAR] Langerhans cells help protect the body against infection. [PAR] Because the cells in the epidermis are completely replaced about every 28 days, cuts and scrapes heal quickly. [PAR] Below the epidermis is the next layer of our skin, the dermis, which is made up of blood vessels, nerve endings, and connective tissue. The dermis nourishes the epidermis. Two types of fibers in the dermis \u2014 collagen and elastin \u2014 help the skin stretch when we bend and reposition itself when we straighten up. Collagen is strong and hard to stretch, and elastin, as its name suggests, is elastic. In older people, some of the elastin-containing fibers degenerate, which is one reason why the skin looks wrinkled. [PAR] The dermis also contains a person's sebaceous glands. These glands, which surround and empty into hair follicles and pores, produce the oil sebum that lubricates the skin and hair. Sebaceous glands are found mostly in the skin on the face, upper back, shoulders, and chest.

While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual.

The narrator of the novel is Ishmael , a sailor on the Pequod who undertakes the journey out of his affection for the sea. [PAR] Moby Dick begins with Ishmael's arrival in New Bedford as he travels toward Nantucket. He rests at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, where he meets Queequeg , a harpooner from New Zealand who will also sail on the Pequod. Although Queequeg appears dangerous, he and Ishmael must share a bed together and the narrator quickly grows fond of the somewhat uncivilized harpooner. Queequeg is actually the son of a High Chief who left New Zealand because of his desire to learn among Christians. The next day, Ishmael attends a church service and listens to a sermon by Father Mapple , a renowned preacher who delivers a sermon considering Jonah and the whale that concludes that the tale is a lesson to preacher Truth in the face of Falsehood. [PAR] On a schooner to Nantucket, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a local bumpkin who mocks Queequeg. However, when this bumpkin is swept overboard, Queequeg saves him. In Nantucket, Queequeg and Ishmael choose between three ships for a year journey, and decide upon the Pequod. The Captain of the Pequod, Peleg , is now retired, and merely owns the boat with another Quaker, Bildad . Peleg tells them of the new captain, Ahab, and immediately describes him as a grand and ungodly man. Before leaving for their voyage, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a stranger named Elijah who predicts disaster on their journey. Before leaving on the Pequod, Elijah again predicts disaster. [PAR] Ishmael and Queequeg board the Pequod, where Captain Ahab is still unseen, secluded in his own cabin. Peleg and Bildad consult with Starbuck , the first mate. He is a Quaker and a Nantucket native who is quite practical. The second mate is Stubb , a Cape Cod native with a more jovial and carefree attitude. The third is Flask , a Martha's Vineyard native with a pugnacious attitude. Melville introduces the rest of the crew, including the Indian harpooner Tashtego , the African harpooner Daggoo . [PAR] Several days into the voyage, Ahab finally appears as a man seemingly made of bronze who stands on an ivory leg fashioned from whalebone. He eventually gets into a violent argument with Stubb when the second mate makes a joke at Ahab's expense, and kicks him. This leads Stubb to dream of kicking Ahab's ivory leg off, but Flask claims that the kick from Ahab is a sign of honor. [PAR] At last, Ahab tells the crew of the Pequod to look for a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow: Moby Dick, the legendary whale that took Ahab's leg. Starbuck tells Ahab that his obsession with Moby Dick is madness, but Ahab claims that all things are masks and there is some unknown reasoning behind that mask that man must strike through. For Ahab, Moby Dick is that mask. Ahab himself seems to recognize his own madness. Starbuck begins to worry that the ship is overmatched by the mad captain and knows that he will see an impious end to Ahab.

The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture. [PAR] The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series, with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005. [PAR] Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons. [PAR] Many tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation. [PAR] A spin-off series, The Cleveland Show, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. \"The Simpsons Guy\", a crossover episode with The Simpsons, aired on September 28, 2014.  Family Guy is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.  In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.  [PAR] As of May 15, 2016, Family Guy was renewed for a fifteenth season.

[PAR] They are the elements Fluorine, ( atomic number 9 ),\u00a0 Chlorine, ( atomic number 17 ), Bromine ( atomic number 35 ), Iodine ( atomic number 53 ), Astatine\u00a0 ( atomic number 85 ), and a newly discovered element not yet given a name, that has an atomic number of 117, ( Discovered in 2010). [PAR] However both Astatine and Element No. 117 are too radioactive to be made in quantities that can be weighed. They are man made elements that have very short half lives;\u00a0 so decay into other elements before one has the chance to make any of their compounds. So in most laboratories Halogen chemistry is essentially about the study of Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine & Iodine. [PAR] The word Halogen was coined in 1842 by the Swedish Chemist Berzelius ( 1779 - 1848 ). It is a made up Swedish word which literally means \"Salt producer\" in Swedish. A name in keeping with the reactive nature of these elements. Lots of Halogen salts are known. Eg. Sodium chloride. Potassium fluoride. Sodium Bromide.

[PAR] Fluorine [PAR] As mentioned previously fluorine has an atomic number of 9. This means that an atom of fluorine will have in addition to 9 protons in the nucleus of its atom, it will have a total of 9 electrons orbiting its nucleus. An individual\u00a0 proton always has a charge of +1 and an individual electron always has a charge of -1. [PAR] We have 9 protons in an atom of fluorine each having a charge of +1, plus 9 electrons in that same atom orbiting the nucleus of that atom. [PAR] ( +1 X 9 ) + (-1 X 9 ) = 0. [PAR] \u00a0So the atom is electrically neutral. [PAR] This is true for all neutral atoms of fluorine.

The halogens make up Group VIIA of the Periodic Table of the elements. Elemental halogens are diatomic molecules. However, due to their high reactivity, the halogens are never found in nature in native form. The family name means \"salt-forming,\" from the Greek for salt, \"hals\", and for generating \"genes\". The salinity of the oceans on Earth is due in large part to such halogen salts (halides) as sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium iodide (KI). [PAR] Halogens display physical and chemical properties typical of nonmetals. They have relatively low melting and boiling points that increase steadily down the group. Near room temperature, the halogens span all of the physical states: Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid.

Although Lemuel Gulliver\u2019s vivid and detailed style of narration makes it clear that he is intelligent and well educated, his perceptions are na\u00efve and gullible. He has virtually no emotional life, or at least no awareness of it, and his comments are strictly factual. Indeed, sometimes his obsession with the facts of navigation, for example, becomes unbearable for us, as his fictional editor, Richard Sympson, makes clear when he explains having had to cut out nearly half of Gulliver\u2019s verbiage. Gulliver never thinks that the absurdities he encounters are funny and never makes the satiric connections between the lands he visits and his own home. Gulliver\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 makes the satire possible, as we pick up on things that Gulliver does not notice. [PAR] Read an in-depth analysis of Gulliver. [PAR] The emperor\u00a0-\u00a0 The ruler of Lilliput. Like all Lilliputians, the emperor is fewer than six inches tall. His power and majesty impress Gulliver deeply, but to us he appears both laughable and sinister. Because of his tiny size, his belief that he can control Gulliver seems silly, but his willingness to execute his subjects for minor reasons of politics or honor gives him a frightening aspect. He is proud of possessing the tallest trees and biggest palace in the kingdom, but he is also quite hospitable, spending a fortune on his captive\u2019s food. The emperor is both a satire of the autocratic ruler and a strangely serious portrait of political power. [PAR] The farmer\u00a0-\u00a0 Gulliver\u2019s first master in Brobdingnag. The farmer speaks to Gulliver, showing that he is willing to believe that the relatively tiny Gulliver may be as rational as he himself is, and treats him with gentleness. However, the farmer puts Gulliver on display around Brobdingnag, which clearly shows that he would rather profit from his discovery than converse with him as an equal. His exploitation of Gulliver as a laborer, which nearly starves Gulliver to death, seems less cruel than simpleminded. Generally, the farmer represents the average Brobdingnagian of no great gifts or intelligence, wielding an extraordinary power over Gulliver simply by virtue of his immense size. [PAR] Glumdalclitch\u00a0-\u00a0 The farmer\u2019s nine-year-old daughter, who is forty feet tall. Glumdalclitch becomes Gulliver\u2019s friend and nursemaid, hanging him to sleep safely in her closet at night and teaching him the Brobdingnagian language by day. She is skilled at sewing and makes Gulliver several sets of new clothes, taking delight in dressing him. When the queen discovers that no one at court is suited to care for Gulliver, she invites Glumdalclitch to live at court as his sole babysitter, a function she performs with great seriousness and attentiveness. To Glumdalclitch, Gulliver is basically a living doll, symbolizing the general status Gulliver has in Brobdingnag. [PAR] The queen\u00a0-\u00a0 The queen of Brobdingnag, who is so delighted by Gulliver\u2019s beauty and charms that she agrees to buy him from the farmer for 1,000 pieces of gold. Gulliver appreciates her kindness after the hardships he suffers at the farmer\u2019s and shows his usual fawning love for royalty by kissing the tip of her little finger when presented before her. She possesses, in Gulliver\u2019s words, \u201cinfinite\u201d wit and humor, though this description may entail a bit of Gulliver\u2019s characteristic flattery of superiors. The queen seems genuinely considerate, asking Gulliver whether he would consent to live at court instead of simply taking him in as a pet and inquiring into the reasons for his cold good-byes with the farmer. She is by no means a hero, but simply a pleasant, powerful person. [PAR] The king\u00a0-\u00a0 The king of Brobdingnag, who, in contrast to the emperor of Lilliput, seems to be a true intellectual, well versed in political science among other disciplines.

[PAR] Fact One [PAR] Fantasia was Walt Disney's third feature film, following on from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940) [PAR] Fact Two [PAR] The Sorcerer's Apprentice, perhaps the most famous short of the film Fantasia, starred Mickey Mouse as the, er, Sorcerer's Apprentice. This role was intended as a come-back role for Disney's famous mouse, who was losing out in popularity to Donald Duck. However, also considered for the role of the apprentice was Dopey from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The animation itself was also originally going to be a one-off cartoon, but since it was more expensive to produce than regular Disney cartoons and was unlikely to make any profit, Disney decided to make it part of a collection of animated sequences with classical music accompaniments which could then be released as a feature film. That collection of animated shorts would become Fantasia. [PAR] Fact Three [PAR] The conductor of the music used in Fantasia was Leopold Stokowski. When The Sorcerer's Apprentice was being worked on, Stokowski offered to conduct the orchestra for free. He probably changed his mind when he found out he would be conducting the orchestra for the entire film. [PAR] Fact Four [PAR] Live action sequences shown between the animated segments show an orchestra playing the soundtrack. In those scenes, the orchestra were miming! The music for all sequences apart from The Sorceror's Apprentice was played by Philadelphia Orchestra. In the film, members of the orchestra pretending to play to the pre-recorded music were local musicians and employees of the film studio. [PAR] Fact Five [PAR] The original release of Fantasia featured an intermission which was announced by the film's host, Deems Taylor. The members of the orchestra are seen leaving their seats while the curtains close, both on the film and in the movie theatre showing it. After the intermission, which would have lasted for fifteen minutes, the curtains in the theatre and on the film open and the orchestra are seen to return to their seats, and then have a bit of a jam session.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Six [PAR] Fantasia, which was essentially a way for Walt Disney to show off animation and sound techniques in films, was the first commercial film to have its soundtrack recorded in stereo. It was also planned that parts of it would be shown in widescreen and other parts to be in 3-D, and, to make the film a real treat for the senses, for perfumes to be sprayed into the theatre during the Nutcracker Suite sequence.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Seven [PAR] Nowadays, films are completed weeks, months or even years before they get their premiere. Fantasia however was completed four hours before premiering in New York City on November 13th 1940. The final scene to be produced was flown to New York on the day of the premiere and edited into the film in time for its first showing. [PAR] Fact Eight [PAR] Despite getting generally good reviews, Fantasia was only shown in twelve movie theatres on its first release due to Disney's distribution company RKO initially deciding not to distribute it. The meant that the film could not make a profit, and meant that the budget for Disney's next film, Dumbo, was quite low. The film got a national release a couple of years later, although heavily edited (from the original 125 runtime to 81 minutes) and in mono. Again it was a commercial failure. A release in 1956 restored the stereo soundtrack, although it was only on its release in 1969 that the film finally made a profit, due to its psychedelic nature being popular with the teenage and college student audiences of the time. Its soundtrack was completely rerecorded for a 1982 release. Even the host's introductions to each segment were dubbed over.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] James BondThe James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. [PAR] The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of , there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.  There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). [PAR] The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0...

There will be no familial succession. In that sense, the rest is silence for the line of the Hamlets. [PAR] Yet there is (as with so many other things in Hamlet) a meta-theatrical element.

[PAR] Three of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer.. [PAR] Prime Meridian [PAR] While the equator divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres , it is the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude and the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian (near the International Date Line ) at 180 degrees longitude that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres .

The series is a satirical depiction of a working class lifestyle epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and many aspects of the human condition. It's the 20th Century Fox debut in animation. [PAR] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390).

On May 4, 2015, the series was officially renewed for seasons twenty-seven (2015\u201316) and twenty-eight (2016\u201317), consisting of 22 episodes each.   [PAR] The Simpsons has received widespread critical acclaim, especially for the \"Golden Age\" of approximately its first ten seasons. Time magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,  and The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\".   On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.

If the skin of a typical 150-pound (68-kilogram) adult male were stretched out flat, it would cover about 2 square yards (1.7 square meters) and weigh about 9 pounds (4 kilograms). Our skin protects the network of muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and everything else inside our bodies. Our eyelids have the thinnest skin, the soles of our feet the thickest.

Hair grows more quickly in summer than winter, and more slowly at night than during the day. [PAR] Like hair, nails are a type of modified skin. Nails protect the sensitive tips of fingers and toes. Human nails aren't necessary for living, but they do provide support for the tips of the fingers and toes, protect them from injury, and aid in picking up small objects. Without them, we'd have a hard time scratching an itch or untying a knot. Nails can be an indicator of a person's general health, and illness often affects their growth. [PAR] continue [PAR] Skin Basics [PAR] Skin is essential in many ways. It forms a barrier that prevents harmful substances and microorganisms from entering the body. It protects body tissues against injury. It also controls the loss of life-sustaining fluids like blood and water, helps regulate body temperature through perspiration (sweating), and protects from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays. [PAR] Without the nerve cells in skin, people couldn't feel warmth, cold, or other sensations. For instance, goosebumps form when the erector pili muscles contract to make hairs on the skin stand up straight when someone is cold, excited,\u00a0or frightened \u2014 the blood vessels keep the body from losing heat by narrowing as much as possible and keeping the warm blood away from the skin's surface, offering insulation and protection. [PAR] Every square inch of skin contains thousands of cells and hundreds of sweat glands, oil glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels. Skin is made up of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous tissue. [PAR] The upper layer of our skin, the epidermis, is the tough, protective outer layer. It's about as thick as a sheet of paper over most parts of the body. The epidermis has four layers of cells that are constantly flaking off and being renewed. In these four layers are three special types of cells: [PAR] Melanocytes produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. All people have roughly the same number of melanocytes; the more melanin that is produced, the darker the skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the production of melanin, which is why people get suntanned or freckled. [PAR] Keratinocytes produce keratin, a type of protein that is a basic component of hair, skin, nails, and helps create an intact barrier. [PAR] Langerhans cells help protect the body against infection. [PAR] Because the cells in the epidermis are completely replaced about every 28 days, cuts and scrapes heal quickly. [PAR] Below the epidermis is the next layer of our skin, the dermis, which is made up of blood vessels, nerve endings, and connective tissue. The dermis nourishes the epidermis. Two types of fibers in the dermis \u2014 collagen and elastin \u2014 help the skin stretch when we bend and reposition itself when we straighten up. Collagen is strong and hard to stretch, and elastin, as its name suggests, is elastic. In older people, some of the elastin-containing fibers degenerate, which is one reason why the skin looks wrinkled. [PAR] The dermis also contains a person's sebaceous glands. These glands, which surround and empty into hair follicles and pores, produce the oil sebum that lubricates the skin and hair. Sebaceous glands are found mostly in the skin on the face, upper back, shoulders, and chest.

[PAR] On his first day at school Bernard crossed swords with caretaker Norman Potter (Deryck Guyler), a former Desert Rat with delusions of grandeur, although with some credibility as he was the right hand man of incompetent headmaster, Maurice Cromwell (Noel Howlett), who in turn was the subject of infatuation by formidable deputy head Doris Ewell (Joan Sanderson). This trio virtually ran the school much to the resignation of the rest of the disillusioned staff and the last thing they wanted to disturb the balance was a young schoolmaster fresh out of teachers training college and full of bright ideals about modern teaching. [PAR] In order to curb Bernard's na\u00efve enthusiasm it was conspired between the trio to give him a class of 'no-hopers', namely 5C. In their last year at school the pupils of this class were an uneducable bunch of delinquents who were simply biding their time until the final bell sounded on the last day of term. This of course did not involve participating in any school activities such as lessons. However, through a series of (comical) events Bernard managed to win over not only the staff but also the class of pupils (who nicknamed him 'Privet' Hedges) that contained 'hard case' Patrick Duffy (Peter Cleall), the tough talking but wimpish Frankie (Hank) Abbott (David Barry), slow witted Dennis Dunstable (Peter Denyer), flirtatious Sharon (Penny Spencer in the first two season's, Carol Hawkins thereafter), and Maureen (Liz Gebhart), who had a crush on her teacher. Support on the teacher front came from Richard Davies who gave a first class performance as the down to earth no-nonsense Welsh science teacher, Mr Price, and the aging Eric Chitty as Mr Smith, a teacher that was clearly beyond retirement age at the series outset. In fact most of the actors who played the students were already in their twenties when Please Sir! began in 1968 and two years later (at the end of the longest last year in school history) the pupils were clearly showing their age. [PAR] The series made stars of several actors although oddly none of the students found lasting television fame.

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. [PAR] Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623.

In the novel, Poirot is called upon by his old friend Lieutenant Hastings, who would come to be the Watson to Poirot's Holmes.

He finishes each case with a dramatic d\u00e9nouement, satisfying his own ego and confirming to all that he is truly \"the greatest mind in Europe.\" His love of elegance, beauty, and precision, as well as his eccentric mannerisms are often ridiculed by the local bumbling policemen, but it is always Poirot who has the last word.

It was locked in a safe until 1974 when it was finally published, earning Poirot a well-deserved obituary in The New York Times; he is the only fictional character to have received such an honour.

The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night \"Must See TV\" lineup. Its widely watched series finale was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 270 episodes have been successfully syndicated worldwide.  Nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series for all eleven of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations.

[PAR] During its run, Cheers became one of the most popular series of all time and has received critical acclaim. In 1997, the episodes \"Thanksgiving Orphans\" and \"Home Is the Sailor\", aired originally in 1987, were respectively ranked No. 7 and No. 45 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.  In 2002, Cheers was ranked No.\u00a018 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.

He has avenged his father's murder, been cut with the poisoned rapier, and, as he has just reflected to Horatio, is about to pass the crown of Denmark (he is, at this moment, effectively the only candidate to be king) to Fortinbras. There will be no familial succession. In that sense, the rest is silence for the line of the Hamlets. [PAR] Yet there is (as with so many other things in Hamlet) a meta-theatrical element. Hamlet has just asked Horatio not to commit suicide (Horatio's line 'Here's yet some liquor left' refers to a drop of poison left and his desire to kill himself) but to stay alive and to 'report' Hamlet's story to Fortinbras. [PAR] Hamlet cannot voice his choice for succession nor can he tell his own story: he is about to die; there can only be silence from him.

This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.  [PAR] Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.

A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85\u2013165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa.

His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring . At the time of his death, Sm\u00e9agol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a Hobbit , but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains in the book The Hobbit. In the movies, he was a deuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.

Around the year TA 2463 , Sm\u00e9agol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron , Isildur , and D\u00e9agol . D\u00e9agol was his cousin, and on Sm\u00e9agol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that D\u00e9agol found a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sm\u00e9agol fell to the power of the ring and demanded it as a birthday present. When De\u00e1gol refused, Sm\u00e9agol promptly flew into a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him to death and taking the ring as his own. Sm\u00e9agol was quickly corrupted further by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470 . The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits. He called it his \"Precious\" or his \"Birthday Present,\" the latter as a justification for killing D\u00e9agol.

Indeed, he made a song about raw fish, that he uses as a riddle to Bilbo and much later sings to Frodo in a longer version. In later years, he found Hobbit and Elven food repulsive. [PAR] During his centuries under the Ring's influence, he developed a sort of dissociative identity disorder : Sm\u00e9agol, his \"good\" personality, still vaguely remembered things like friendship and love, while Gollum, his \"bad\" personality, was a slave to the Ring and would kill anyone who tried to take it.

He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon\u2019s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 1799, during Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt, a French soldier named Pierre Francois Bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the Rosetta Stone. This artifact provided the key to cracking the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years. [PAR] As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. [PAR] In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. [PAR] In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general. [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Rise to Power [PAR] Since 1792, France\u2019s revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various European nations. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria, one of his country\u2019s primary rivals, in a series of battles in Italy. In 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French. [PAR] The following year, the Directory, the five-person group that had governed France since 1795, offered to let Napoleon lead an invasion of England. Napoleon determined that France\u2019s naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior British Royal Navy. Instead, he proposed an invasion of Egypt in an effort to wipe out British trade routes with India. Napoleon\u2019s troops scored a victory against Egypt\u2019s military rulers, the Mamluks, at the Battle of the Pyramids in July 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the British at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. In early 1799, Napoleon\u2019s army launched an invasion of Ottoman-ruled Syria, which ended with the failed siege of Acre, located in modern-day Israel. That summer, with the political situation in France marked by uncertainty, the ever-ambitious and cunning Napoleon opted to abandon his army in Egypt and return to France.

His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring . At the time of his death, Sm\u00e9agol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a Hobbit , but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains in the book The Hobbit.

D\u00e9agol was his cousin, and on Sm\u00e9agol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that D\u00e9agol found a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sm\u00e9agol fell to the power of the ring and demanded it as a birthday present. When De\u00e1gol refused, Sm\u00e9agol promptly flew into a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him to death and taking the ring as his own. Sm\u00e9agol was quickly corrupted further by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470 .

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events.

MGM acquired the distribution rights in 1997 after their acquisition of Orion Pictures. The film also marks the culmination of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory .

[PAR] The film opens with a middle-aged, yet still athletic James Bond making his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond lets his guard down, forgetting that the girl might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is stabbed to death by her. Or so it seems. [PAR] In fact, the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. [PAR] Feeling that Bond is slipping, M orders him to enroll in a health clinic in order to \"eliminate all those free radicals\" and get back into shape. While there, Bond discovers a mysterious nurse, Fatima Blush , and her patient, who is wrapped in bandages. His suspicions are aroused even further when a thug (Lippe) tries to kill him. [PAR] Blush and her charge, an American Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi , are in fact operatives of [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] , a criminal organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his retinas to match the retinal pattern of the American President. Using his position as a pilot, and the president's eye pattern to circumvent security, Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world. [PAR] M reluctantly reactivates the 00 section, and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons, beginning with a rendezvous with Domino Petachi , the pilot's sister, who is kept a virtual prisoner by her lover, Maximillian Largo . Bond pursues Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas , where he engages Domino, Fatima Blush, and Largo in a game of wits and resources as he attempts to derail [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] 's scheme.

The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets. [PAR] The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. [PAR] The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway. The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge. [PAR] History [PAR] Inception [PAR] In the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the East End of London led to a requirement for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London. [PAR] A Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect (who was also one of the judges),  was approved. [PAR] Jones' engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry, devised the idea of a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. [PAR] Construction [PAR] Construction started in 1887 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.  \u2013 and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. [PAR] Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance. [PAR] Jones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa\u00e7ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was \u00a31,184,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ).

According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions.

The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. [PAR] The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978\u201392). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958\u201366), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967\u201392). [PAR] Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u201362) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u201374). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. [PAR] All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. [PAR] Background [PAR] \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". [PAR] The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.)

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen English counties and cover 9.3% of England, with no national park in the central counties.

It is said that the two most well-known political parties in American are the Democrats and Republicans. Surprising to some, the two parties are represented by the symbols of a donkey and an elephant (respectively). [PAR] Initially these animal symbols were used on campaign  banners, but over the years they have become two of the most outstanding logos  in American politics allowing candidates to introduce their US political  logo designs . Let\u2019s take a look at the brief history behind these two political logos. We\u2019ll also review how these two animal symbols came to represent the two of the biggest political parties of US. [PAR] The Democratic Donkey [PAR] The Democrats were first to use the donkey as their representative symbol. The donkey represents the Democrats\u2019 beginning 1828.\u00a0 The running President of 1828 was President Andrew Jackson and he was labeled as a \u201cjackass\u201d due to his populist views and stubborn nature. His main slogan was, \u201cLet the people rule.\u201d Although the cartoon was depicted to mock him, it was later adopted by Jackson himself to represent his Democratic party in 1837. [PAR] The Republican Elephant [PAR] Some believe that being a Republican influenced Thomas Nast on choosing a bull elephant to represent his party. However, the Republican elephant was not as intentional as Jackson\u2019s donkey. It was formed through a series of events involving New York\u2019s two popular magazines, The Herald and The Harper\u2019s Weekly. The Herald once ran a story of zoo animals being let loose and roaming in New York\u2019s Central Park looking for prey. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a cartoon of a donkey wearing lion\u2019s skin, chasing away all the animals (given below). This cartoon was a metaphor for President Ulysses S. Grant whom was running for third term presidency and there was a significant amount of conflict in the Democratic Party. This was one reason that the cartoon included a panicked elephant bearing the label, \u201cRepublican Vote.\u201d \u00a0Ever since then, the elephant became the Republican Party\u2019s its main symbol.However such attacks on political campaign branding are not isolated  incidents of the past. We witness Republican  logo design goof ups today as well. [PAR] Discussion and Meaning of these Symbols [PAR] The Democratic donkey represents hard work, diligence, humbleness and a dedication to the USA. The Republicans however, strongly disagree and consider the donkey a symbol of stubbornness. [PAR] On the other hand, the Republican elephant represents intelligence, dignity and is considered as the symbol of strength (as it is seen as the only animal that stood up to a lion). In contrast to this, the Democrats see the elephant as comparable to a circus animal. [PAR] Both of these symbols found firm foundation in the growing American pop culture and were copyrighted to represent the two political parties. The political logos have the prominent standardized colors and stars of the American flag. Generally, the Republican elephant logo upholds 3 stars while the Democratic donkey logo design has 4. However, the donkey can also been seen with a variation of 3 stars. [PAR] The Man Behind the Logo Designs [PAR] Thomas Nast was a political cartoonist, who usually drew satirical cartoons depicting the state of American politics. It was his idea to use the two animals for representing the Democratic and Republican parties. Thomas Nast was born in 1840 and had a great career being a caricaturist, an illustrator and a painter. Apart from the political symbols, he is also well acclaimed for the sketch of fat and jolly Santa Claus carrying gifts for little children (previously, Santa was depicted as skinny). Although the artist died in 1902, his sketches and drawings still live on. [PAR] There you go! Wasn\u2019t that an interesting history?

The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice.

[PAR] Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066\u20131154,  Plantagenet 1154\u20131485,  Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of  1649\u20131660).

[PAR] The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558\u20131603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World. [PAR] From the accession of James I in 1603, the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the  execution of Charles I in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War  established  the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament, although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

This rash of gang violence reached its bloody climax in a garage on the city\u2019s North Side on February 14, 1929, when seven men associated with the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, one of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, were shot to death by several men dressed as policemen. The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time. No one was ever brought to trial for the murders. [PAR] The Downfall of Public Enemy No. 1 [PAR] Though the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre marked the end of any significant gang opposition to Capone\u2019s rule in Chicago, it can also be said to have marked the beginning of his downfall.

Image via AstroBob [PAR] In order for us to see it at its enormous distance, Deneb must also be tremendously bright and energetic. Among the 20 brightest stars, only Rigel in Orion surpasses Deneb in intrinsic brightness. Deneb is an A2Ia star, which says that it is white hot (A2) and a supergiant star (Ia). Prof. James Kaler, using the figure of 2,600 light years as the distance, estimated a diameter 200 times greater than our sun, and about a quarter of a million times brighter in visible light. Considering its spectral classification (A2), Deneb must have a surface temperature between about 8500 to 9000 kelvins (roughly 14,800 to 15,700 degrees F).

It\u2019s the brightest of the stars composing the constellation Cygnus the Swan, where it marks the Swan\u2019s Tail. When you hear \u2018deneb\u2019 in a star name, it always means \u2018tail.\u2019 Simultaneously, Deneb marks the head of an asterism (a readily recognizable grouping of stars that is not an official constellation), known as the Northern Cross. Plus it is one of the three stars known as the Summer Triangle . The other two stars are Vega and Altair . Deneb is the northernmost and dimmest of the three Triangle stars, but its association with the other bright stars makes it easy to identify. [PAR] Deneb is circumpolar as seen from locations of", "topic": "Explore the relationship between apparent brightness, intrinsic luminosity, and distance as exemplified by Deneb\u2019s visibility despite its extreme remoteness.", "question": "Considering Deneb\u2019s extreme distance from Earth and its classification as an A2Ia supergiant with an intrinsic luminosity roughly a quarter of a million times that of the Sun, how does Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness at Earth illustrate the quantitative relationship between a star\u2019s intrinsic luminosity, distance, and observed brightness, and what fundamental astrophysical principle explains why Deneb remains visible to the naked eye despite being thousands of light-years away?", "choices": {"A": "Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness is directly proportional to its intrinsic luminosity and inversely proportional to its distance, illustrating the Doppler effect which allows distant luminous stars to appear bright.", "B": "Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness decreases with the square of its distance but remains observable because its intrinsic luminosity is extremely high, demonstrating the inverse-square law of light propagation.", "C": "Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness remains constant regardless of distance due to gravitational lensing, which magnifies the light of distant supergiant stars.", "D": "Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness is primarily determined by its surface temperature rather than its distance or intrinsic luminosity, consistent with Wien\u2019s displacement law."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The apparent brightness of a star observed from Earth depends on its intrinsic luminosity divided by the square of its distance, as described by the inverse-square law of light propagation. Deneb\u2019s exceptional intrinsic luminosity compensates for its vast distance, enabling it to be visible to the naked eye despite being thousands of light-years away.", "question_token_count": 85, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 30}
