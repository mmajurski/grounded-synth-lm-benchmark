[PAR] Our American Cousin by Tom Taylor was the play Lincoln watched the night of his assassination. John Wilkes Booth, in addition to being a conspirator, was a working actor, so he knew that the light hearted comedy would garner loud belly laughs from the audience, providing the ideal moment in which to muffle the blast of a pistol. (He also anticipated a large crowd because special fliers had been made to announce that the president would be in attendance -- not the best security measure in retrospect.) [PAR] Our American Cousin is a silly tale in three acts about a \"uncivilized\" American who arrives in England to claim a old British manor.

[PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know [PAR] When the play was first performed in the 1850s, one of the supporting characters (the ridiculous Lord Dundreary) became so popular, that the actor who originated the role, E. A. Sothern, began creating a string of ad libs to meet the demands of the humor-craving audience. According to many historians, Booth knew the play well, and knew that a certain line of dialogue in Act Three would propel the audience into its loudest burst of laughter.

However, sexism, racism, and inequality suggests otherwise about Homo sapiens. For instance, a black white, brown and grey rat will all socialize, because they recognize members of the same species. All other animals socialize because of the similarities where human beings look for reasons to isolate ourselves from each other. Fortunately, people have made great strides over the past century, putting many insignificant differences aside. Though there are still issues with inequality , recent ordinances have at last attempted to rectify racial, sexual, and religious inequality in England. One such ordinance is the equality act 2010 which was intended to unify previously passed, anti-discrimination acts of Parliament. [PAR] The Equality Act 2010 [PAR] This act of parliament is supposed to simplify the way the government classifies and enforces the acts associated with the anti-discrimination laws in the UK. Anti-discrimination laws are acts which have been passed by the different countries of the world. Each law is designed to prevent someone from being denied basic rights based solely upon his or her race, gender or sexual preference . In Great Britain, these laws began to surface in the 1970\u2019s. [PAR] However, enforcing and even coding these laws has always presented certain challenges. First, there are still people who feel as though they should be permitted to discriminate. There are issues as to what penalties these individuals should face after they\u2019ve been found out. There\u2019s also an ongoing controversy as to exactly what constitutes discrimination. The Equality Act 2010 is basically a tool to organize the other anti-discrimination laws in the UK so they\u2019re easier to understand and deal with. However, the original anti-discrimination laws must be properly examined before the equality act can truly be understood. [PAR] The Equal Pay Act of 1970 [PAR] The first ever anti-discrimination law to be passed by British Parliament is the Equal Pay Act of 1970. This law was to prevent women from receiving different pay and different treatment from men on a job. Though this is one of the earliest examples of a modern country adopting equal pay laws, it wasn\u2019t\u2019 done without intervention.

[PAR] Uniting for Consensus [PAR] Embed / Widget [PAR] Uniting for Consensus core members [PAR] Uniting for Consensus (UfC) is a movement, nicknamed the Coffee Club, that developed in the 1990s in opposition to the possible expansion of permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council . Under the leadership of Italy, [2] [3] it aims to counter the bids for permanent seats proposed by G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) and is calling for a consensus before any decision is reached on the form and size of the Security Council. [PAR] History [PAR] Italy, through the ambassador Francesco Paolo Fulci , along with Pakistan, Mexico and Egypt, in 1995 founded the \"Coffee Club\". [4] The four countries were united by a rejection of the increase of the permanent members of the Security Council and the desire to encourage rather the expansion of non-permanent seats. The founders of the group were soon joined by other countries, including Spain, Argentina, Turkey, Canada, and South Korea, and in a short time the group came to include about 50 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. [4] The thesis of the Uniting for Consensus group is that the increase of permanent seats would have further accentuated the disparity between the member countries and resulted in the extension of a series of privileges with a cascade effect . The new permanent members would have in fact benefited from the method of electing particularly advantageous in a number of specific organs of the United Nations System . [PAR] After having agreed with the need to increase the representativeness of the Security Council, in 2005 during the 59th session of the United Nations General Assembly , the UfC group \u2014 led by the representatives of Canada, Italy, Colombia and Pakistan \u2014 made a proposal [5] that centres on an enlargement of the number of non-permanent members from ten to twenty. The non-permanent members would be elected by the General Assembly for a two-year term and would be eligible for immediate re-election, subject to the decision of their respective geographical groups. [6] The other members and co-sponsors of the text, entitled \"Reform of the Security Council\", were listed as Argentina, Costa Rica, Malta, Mexico, San Marino, South Korea, Spain and Turkey. [7] Although the proposal was not accepted, the initiative found broad consensus among member states, including permanent member China. [8] [PAR] On 20 April 2009, Colombia and Italy, acting as representatives of the UfC group, provided a new model of reform, [9] which was presented as a concrete attempt to reach a deal. The document proposed creating a new category of seats, still non-permanent, but elected for an extended duration (3 to 5 years terms) without the possibility of immediate re-elections. This new kind of seat would not be allocated to single national countries but rather to regional groups on a rotational basis. As far as traditional categories of seats are concerned, the UfC proposal does not imply any change, but only the introduction of small and medium size states among groups eligible for regular seats. This proposal includes even the question of veto , giving a range of options that goes from abolition to limitation of the application of the veto only to Chapter VII matters. [PAR] During the last round, Italy firmly rejected the G4 proposal as well as the African Union one and even denounced the unfair behaviour of G4 countries. According to Italy, the G4 is attempting to exclude the UfC proposal from the floor, \u201con the basis of a presumed level of support\u201d. [10] Moreover, Italy believes that it has shown flexibility by putting forward a new proposal on April 2009, while the G4 remained tied to its 2005 document.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Review: The Rise and Fall of Little Voice - A Younger TheatreReview: The Rise and Fall of Little Voice - A Younger TheatreA Younger Theatre [PAR] Review: The Rise and Fall of Little Voice [PAR] in Theatre [PAR] Jim Cartwright\u2019s 1992 Olivier award-winning play, The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, depicts the life of the incredibly shy and reclusive Little Voice, who finds comfort in her late father\u2019s records as she hides away from her loud, overbearing and self-involved mother, Mari. When local club agent Ray Say begins dating Mari, he discovers a hidden talent in Little Voice, who, having been hidden away in her room for years, has perfected her vocals and impressions, and he is set on making her into a success. [PAR] Kate Robson-Stuart\u2019s voice is without a doubt the star of this production. Mature and soulful, Robson-Stuart\u2019s tones fill the theatre to the brim and ensure that all attention is immediately drawn towards her in the rare moments when Little Voice is allowed to shine. Anna Skye also stands out as the glaringly desperate Mari. Her obvious desire to be wanted by Ray Say is both comical and embarrassing, yet Skye\u2019s sudden and convincing switch to a heartbroken and humiliated victim in the second act does well to bring the audience around to pitying her when both her lover and daughter finally turn on her. [PAR] Not a lot happens in the first act of this production, though. In fact, the story progresses very little and serves instead to set up a cast of unlikeable, and at times loathsome, characters. Even shy Little Voice\u2019s lack of communication is grating after a while and you can almost come to understand her mother\u2019s frustration towards her. This does come mainly from a very slow pace throughout the entire production; almost every line is spoken at the same tempo as the one before, which means the first, fairly uneventful half drags significantly. Simon Jessop\u2019s sudden outburst as Ray Say in the second act thus comes as a complete shock in contrast to the rest of the piece. Jessop exudes such venom in Ray Say\u2019s unwarranted and cruel verbal assault on Mari that for a little while he is fearsome.\u00a0 In contrast however, Mari\u2019s spiteful torrent of rage towards her daughter is slightly underplayed by Skye. Again, it is the pace that means this scene suffers; the speed of dialogue changes little from the calmer scenes and means a much weaker contrast and less authentic domestic argument on stage. [PAR] The relationship between Little Voice and Billy (Elliot Harper) is touching, and builds very slowly from initial awkward first glances to Billy\u2019s caring and protective manner towards Little Voice. For a relationship lacking in dialogue, Harper and Robson-Stuart manage to successfully create intimacy through the many silences and long glances. Bibi Nerheim plays the sweet and helpful Sadie with innocence and a gentle charm. Although her character serves very little in advancing the play, she provides some light humour as Mari\u2019s pushover neighbour. [PAR] This is a colourful production of bold and exuberant characters that is complemented by an authentic set of a shabby, run-down, 90s suburban home. With a desolate and crumbling kitchen and a sparse bedroom for Little Voice, the design suits the atmosphere of claustrophobia and neglect that the house is rife with. Despite the sluggish pace at times, a strong cast make this a lively and watchable production. [PAR] The Rise and Fall of Little Voice is playing at Queens Theatre until 12 October.

During the First World War she was arrested on charges of espionage and executed by a French firing squad. Evidence of her actual guilt is frequently questioned. [PAR] Mata Hari was born 7 August 1876 in Leeuwarden, Netherlands. Her name at birth was Margaretha Geerruida Zelle. Until the age of 13 she lived a comfortable lifestyle, attending elite private schools paid for by her father. Her father doted much attention on his \u2018little princess\u2019 making her used to the attention of men. However, in 1889, her father went bankrupt and her parents soon divorced. She tried to study to be a kindergarten teacher but her godfather removed her after the Headmaster became attached to Margaretha. [PAR] When she was 18, she answered a newspaper ad from a handsome Dutch officer living in Java, the East Indies. In those days it was common for Dutchman living in colonies to request wives by placing ads in papers. Margaretha moved to Java where the couple had two children. However, the marriage was not a happy one, with her husband, Rudolph Macleod, suffering from alcoholism; he would often be violent to his wife, blaming her for many of his own failings. Margaretha also had difficulty in her role as housewife. She admitted \u201cI was not content at home\u2026 I wanted to live like a colourful butterfly in the sun.\u201d During her time in the Dutch East Indies Margaretha took the opportunity to learn about native dance and the local customs.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Westminster Abbey - London, United Kingdom - History and ...Westminster Abbey - London, United Kingdom - History and Visitor Information [PAR] Site information [PAR] Westminster Abbey HISTORY [PAR] Westminster Abbey is an iconic medieval structure and the site of many historic royal and national events, from coronations and weddings to burials and even deaths. Centrally located in London, Westminster Abbey was first constructed in the eleventh century by King Edward the Confessor, a Saxon king who dedicated this new church to St Peter. [PAR] Before the Abbey [PAR] In fact, the site on which Westminster Abbey was built was already of religious importance prior to its construction. The earliest record of the site of Westminster Abbey being used for religious purposes dates to the mid 10th century, when St Dunstan arrived at what was then known as Thorny Island to establish a religious house for the Benedictine order. The king built his church near to the existing monastic buildings. [PAR] The First Burial, the First Coronation [PAR] Westminster Abbey was consecrated in December 1065, a few days before Edward died. Fittingly, the king was the first of a long line of monarchs to be buried there. In 1066, William the Conqueror added to the growing prestige of Westminster Abbey by choosing to be crowned there, becoming King William I on 25th December 1066. From that point onwards, Westminster Abbey would be the site of almost every royal coronation. [PAR] By the middle of the 12th century, Edward the Confessor had been canonised and his remains were moved to a magnificent shrine within the Abbey\u2019s sanctuary, where pilgrims would flock to ask for his intercession. They also gave donations to the shrine, making Westminster Abbey rather wealthy. In the 13th century, King Henry III resolved to rebuild Westminster Abbey to make it rival the French Gothic cathedrals of the era. This construction project would eventually form the current incarnation of the Abbey. He also moved the remains of St Edward to an even more magnificent shrine, where he still remains. [PAR] Death of Henry IV [PAR] One of the most famous events recorded to have taken place in the Abbey was the death of Henry IV in the Jerusalem Chapel in 1413. It had been predicted that he would die in Jerusalem, so, when he collapsed in the Abbey, he knew he was dying when he was taken to the Jerusalem chamber. Shakespeare immortalised the scene with Henry V trying the crown on while his father lay dying. [PAR] Tudor Times [PAR] The 16th century finds the Tudor monarchs influencing the history of the Abbey: Henry VII started to build the Lady Chapel, Henry VIII dissolved the monastery (but spared the Abbey) and Elizabeth I established the Abbey as the foremost cathedral in England (a position it only held briefly). [PAR] Burials [PAR] Over 3,000 people are buried at Westminster Abbey. There are 600 tombs and monuments to see, many of them Royal and open to visitors. Some of the most famous royals buried there are Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I and Henry III. The tomb of the Unknown Soldier is in the Abbey and there is a service each Remembrance Sunday. Funeral services for important figures and royalty are also held in the Abbey and over time prominent funerals at the Abbey have included those of Winston Churchill, George VI, Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth I. [PAR] Poets\u2019 corner is one of the main attractions at the Abbey, it being the burial site of many prominent non-royal figures. The first poet to be buried here was Geoffrey Chaucer, and many others have joined him in the succeeding centuries. [PAR] The Coronation Chair [PAR] In addition to the numerous burial sites and architectural features, one of the most impressive sites at Westminster Abbey is the Coronation Chair, produced in 1300-1301 under the orders of King Edward I (Longshanks).

Some of the tools used by a blacksmith include hammers, tongs and the blacksmith\u2019s anvil among others and the items produced include agricultural implements, furniture, weapons, cooking utensils and railings. [PAR] The blacksmith\u2019s anvil is a tool mainly used for forging and though most anvils are made using steel, different types also exist. An anvil is a basic tool that is made of a block of steel with a very hard surface upon which other objects are struck. [PAR] The anvil block is made as massive as is practically possible. The reason for this is, the higher the anvil\u2019s rebound capability, the more efficient the energy of the striking tool will be when it is transferred to the piece that is being worked on. [PAR] The anvil face: Primarily, the working surface of the blacksmith\u2019s anvil is known as the face. It is generally tempered and hardened to be able to resist the blows of the blacksmith\u2019s hammer. This keeps it from getting deformed when used repeatedly and also minimizes the amount of force necessary that needs to be used for each blow of the hammer. The face of the anvil should never receive a direct blow from the hammer as it may damage the brittle steel. The face of the anvil is made from hardened steel and it should be flat, smooth and should have rounded edges for it to be suitable for most of the work.

This rash of gang violence reached its bloody climax in a garage on the city\u2019s North Side on February 14, 1929, when seven men associated with the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, one of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, were shot to death by several men dressed as policemen. The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time. No one was ever brought to trial for the murders. [PAR] The Downfall of Public Enemy No. 1 [PAR] Though the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre marked the end of any significant gang opposition to Capone\u2019s rule in Chicago, it can also be said to have marked the beginning of his downfall.

Although that particular project went nowhere, the idea of doing a story set in Biblical times obviously appealed to the group. After trying out several ideas in which the main character was in some way linked to Christ, as a thirteenth apostle for example, the group encountered a problem: the life of Christ is very difficult to parody. Regardless of what one believes, the character of Christ and the things he says are fundamentally good 1 .

Rebelling against the Roman oppressors, Brian joins the 'People's Front of Judea' 3 (PFJ) and sets about undermining the Roman occupation. During an abortive attempt to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, Brian is captured, but manages to escape under cover of Pilate's speech impediment. After almost accidentally exposing the PFJ, Brian finds himself masquerading as a prophet in front of a hostile crowd. After a false start, his improvised words of wisdom have the unforseen effect of convincing the local populace that he is the Messiah. Once more, Brian finds himself on the run. After distracting the crowd with a juniper-protecting heretic, Brian finally manages to spend some time alone with fellow PFJ member (and much more), Judith. Unfortunately, his ever-increasing band of devoted followers track him down and, despite his best efforts, refuse to go away and work it out for themselves.

He called for peace from the leaders of Europe and used his diplomatic training to try to avoid war. The Vatican observed strict impartiality during World War II just as it had done in World War I. This did not prevent Pius XII from trying to keep Mussolini\u2019s Italy out of the war or from warning the Allies of the imminent invasion of the Low Countries in 1940. [PAR] His first encyclical, Summi Pontificatus (On the Limitations of the Authority of the State), set out the importance he attached to impartiality of the Vatican and contained a strong attack on totalitarianism. Unable to prevent war, Pius XII used a series of radio broadcasts to urge peace and to condemn the evils of modern warfare. Although expressing sympathy for the innocent victims, he did not go so far as to condemn the Nazis outright. He was wary of reprisals of further violence against those already suffering at the hands of the Nazi regime as had happened earlier when Dutch bishops had publicly criticized its actions. More Jews were subsequently deported from Holland than from any other western country. [PAR] Life-Saving Initiatives [PAR] Despite the Vatican\u2019s careful neutrality, there were a number of initiatives undertaken by the Pope which have been credited with saving many thousands of lives. Pius XII established the Vatican Information Service to help refugees and instructed the Church to provide discreet aid to the Jews, thereby saving many lives. Many Jews were able to take refuge in church buildings, including the Pope\u2019s own summer residence, Castel Gondolfo. He brokered the release of some Roman Jews rounded up in 1943, although most were sent to Auschwitz. He was instrumental in obtaining the entry into South America of many Jews who had converted and took personal responsibility for the care of children of Italian Jews deported from Italy. After he secretly intervened when a boatload of Jewish refugees heading for Palestine was refused permission to land in Istanbul and held prisoner in Rhodes, they were transferred to a camp in southern Italy where they were found safe in 1943. He invited Jews to join the Vatican Palatine Guards to enable them to stay in Vatican City (their numbers swelled from about 400 to about 4,000). [PAR] Controversy and Praise [PAR] Pope Pius XII in Regalia [PAR] Critics of Pius XII have denounced him for his perceived lack of action to oppose Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime and its actions against and large scale extermination of Jewish people. As evidence, they cite his decision to not openly condemn Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland in 1939, seeing this as anti-Semitic behavior implicitly condoning the Holocaust . In recent years, he has been vilified by Jewish academics and commentators for the actions they believe he could and should have taken. [PAR] Pius XII\u2019s supporters, however, have hailed him as a champion of peace whose diplomacy and actions during World War II have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. By way of evidence, they point to his desire to broker peace, to avoid further harm, to be able to help more Jews by not bringing down further retaliation from the Nazi regime, and to have Vatican City as a refuge. They see his insistence on impartiality as being a sign of fairness rather than the indifference attributed to him by his critics. [PAR] He was praised by Jewish leaders of the time and subsequent commentators for his actions, including Jewish physicist Albert Einstein and Golda Meir, then Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs. It appears that most criticism has occurred in relatively recent years rather than the time during World War II itself and shortly thereafter, when Pius XII was held in high esteem by Jews and Christians alike.

On October 21, 1966, 144 people were killed, 116 of them children, when a waste tip slid down a mountainside; unsurprisingly the story generated massive media coverage, and even 40 years on the name Aberfan is synonymous with the tragedy.

Your ovaries are almond-shaped organs that sit on each side of the uterus in your pelvis. Your ovaries contain eggs and produce hormones that control your menstrual cycle. [PAR] When oophorectomy involves removing both ovaries, it's called bilateral oophorectomy. When the surgery involves removing only one ovary, it's called unilateral oophorectomy. [PAR] Female reproductive system [PAR] The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system. [PAR] Why it's done [PAR] Oophorectomy may be performed for: [PAR] A tubo-ovarian abscess \u2014 a pus-filled pocket involving a fallopian tube and an ovary [PAR] Ovarian cancer [PAR] Noncancerous (benign) ovarian tumors or cysts [PAR] Reducing the risk of ovarian cancer or breast cancer in women at increased risk [PAR] Ovarian torsion \u2014 the twisting of an ovary [PAR] Oophorectomy combined with other procedures [PAR] Oophorectomy can be done alone, but it is often done as part of a more complete surgery to remove the uterus (hysterectomy) in women who have undergone menopause. [PAR] In women with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, oophorectomy is commonly combined with surgery to remove the nearby fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) since they share a common blood supply with the ovaries. When combined, the procedure is called salpingo-oophorectomy. [PAR] Normal ovary [PAR] A woman has two ovaries, one on each side of her uterus. An ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. [PAR] Normal ovary [PAR] A woman has two ovaries, one on each side of her uterus. An ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. [PAR] Ovarian cancer [PAR] Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries. Women have two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. The ovaries \u2014 each about the size of an almond \u2014 produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. [PAR] Endometriosis [PAR] Endometriosis occurs when bits of the tissue that lines the uterus (endometrium) grow on other pelvic organs, such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Outside the uterus, endometrial tissue thickens and bleeds, just as the normal endometrium does during the menstrual cycle. [PAR] Ovarian torsion [PAR] Ovarian torsion occurs when an ovary becomes twisted. One cause of ovarian torsion is an ovarian cyst. [PAR] Types of hysterectomy surgery [PAR] A partial hysterectomy (top left) removes just the uterus, and the cervix is left intact. A total hysterectomy (top right) removes the uterus and cervix. At the time of a total hysterectomy, your surgeon may also remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bottom). [PAR] Risks [PAR] Oophorectomy is a relatively safe procedure that carries a small risk of complications, including: [PAR] Bleeding [PAR] Damage to nearby organs [PAR] Rupture of a tumor, spreading potentially cancerous cells [PAR] Retention of ovary cells that continue to cause signs and symptoms, such as pelvic pain, in premenopausal women (ovarian remnant syndrome) [PAR] Small bowel obstruction [PAR] Risks of premature menopause [PAR] Women who have yet to undergo menopause will experience premature menopause if both ovaries are removed.

His early life gave little indication of his ultimate potential; until the time of his accession in 1855, aged 37, few imagined that he would be known to posterity as a leader able to implement the most challenging reforms undertaken in Russia since the reign of Peter the Great. [PAR] In the period of his life as heir apparent, the intellectual atmosphere of Saint Petersburg was unfavourable to any kind of change: freedom of thought and all forms of private initiative were suppressed vigorously. Personal and official censorship was rife; criticism of the authorities was regarded as a serious offence. Some 26 years afterward, he had the opportunity of implementing changes; however, he was to be assassinated in public by the Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) terrorist organisation in the future.  [PAR] His education as future emperor was carried out under the supervision of the liberal romantic poet and gifted translator Vasily Zhukovsky,  grasping a smattering of a great many subjects and becoming familiar with the chief modern European languages. His alleged lack of interest in military affairs detected by later historians was his reflection on the results on his own family and on the effect on the whole country of the unsavoury Crimean War. Unusually for the time, the young Alexander was taken on a six-month tour of Russia, visiting 20 provinces in the country.   He also visited many prominent Western European countries.   As Tsarevich, Alexander became the first Romanov heir to visit Siberia.  [PAR] Reign [PAR] Alexander II succeeded to the throne upon the death of his father in 1855. The first year of his reign was devoted to the prosecution of the Crimean War and, after the fall of Sevastopol, to negotiations for peace led by his trusted counsellor Prince Alexander Gorchakov. The country had been exhausted and humiliated by the war.   Bribe-taking, theft and corruption were everywhere.   Encouraged by public opinion he began a period of radical reforms, including an attempt to not depend on a landed aristocracy controlling the poor, a move to developing Russia's natural resources and to reform all branches of the administration.  In 1867 he sold Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million (equivalent to roughly $200 million in current dollars) after recognising the great difficulty of defending it against the United Kingdom or the former British colony of Canada.

During his career, pro wrestling commentator Gordon Solie used the soo-PLAY pronunciation [1] (as have the AWA's Rod Trongard and Terry Taylor ), but almost all other pro wrestling talent pronounces it SOO-plex. [PAR] Suplex variants [PAR] Professional wrestling features many different varieties of suplexes. The following are among the most common, but many more exist, particularly as the signature techniques of individual wrestlers. [PAR] Front facelock variants [PAR] In these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other, the attacking wrestler then applies a front facelock to the opponent before executing a throw. In most cases, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move. The most common front facelock suplex is the vertical suplex . [PAR] Fisherman's suplex [PAR] Also spelled as a fisherman suplex and also known as a cradle suplex or leg hook suplex. With their opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over the attacker's shoulder, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg behind the opponent's knee with his/her free arm and falls backwards, flipping the opponent onto his/her back. In most cases the attacking wrestler will keep the leg hooked and bridge to pin the opponent in a cradle-like position, as in the case of Curt Hennig 's Perfect-plex and Bobby Roode 's Pay Off. [2] Val Venis also used this move in the past. [3] Other times the wrestler will apply a leglock submission hold to the hooked leg.

The Holland VI was the inventor's greatest achievement and the most advanced submarine design in the world at the time. [PAR] John Philip Holland, from Clare, was part of an elite group of Irish engineers and scientists who made momentous advances in the development of submarine technology. That group includes Howard Grubb who perfected the design of the submarine periscope and Louis Brennan who designed the first proper steerable torpedo. Holland not only shares his Irish birth with these inventors but he also shares an undeserved anonymity, for John Philip Holland was the most important pioneer in the development of the modern submarine. In 1862, while living in Cork City, Holland was transfixed by newspaper reports of the Battle of Hampton Roads, a naval engagement in the American Civil War. The accounts of the battle and its ironclad warships were to set Holland on a long and torturous journey of invention. It would end with Holland\u2019s designs forming the basis for the US navy\u2019s first submarine fleet and then for submarine navies throughout the world. [PAR] Courage and Conflicts\u00a0details Holland\u2019s time in Ireland and how, in 1873, he left for the US. From then onwards, Holland\u2019s life would swing from glorious highs to dispiriting lows. The book tells of how he initially made his name by building a submarine for the Irish revolutionary group, the Fenians. It was from this relationship that the so-called \u2018Fenian Ram\u2019; a boat that the Fenians hoped would cripple the British Royal Navy. This period was an extraordinary time in his life, with Fenian intrigues, British spies and foreign diplomats all impinging upon Holland's work. His relationship with the Fenians would end rancorously but Holland had made a name for himself in naval circles. By the mid 1890\u2019s Holland was involved in a project with the US navy and in 1897 he launched the submarine that was to make his name, the \u2018Holland VI\u2019. Great success, unfortunately, often attracts avarice and Holland would fall prey to his business partners. Ultimately, Holland would lose control of the patents on his designs. Nevertheless, he would continue to push back the technical boundaries of underwater technology and through a varied career would even create submarines for the Japanese government. The company he helped found, the Electric Boat Company, would flourish and eventually become General Dynamics Corporation. [PAR] Holland\u2019s story is that of an emigrant who, through sheer ability and hard-work, made a profound difference in his chosen field. Yet, his aims were not entirely militaristic. He spoke at length of his belief that the submarine, by ending the naval dominance of the world\u2019s great powers, would make the\u00a0oceans safe for all.This was a theme that he would return to many times as when he told Thomas Edison that, in building submarines, he was \u2018animated with the desire of helping to end naval warfare\u2019. He was a fervent proponent of the use of submarines in commercial and public transport. He left detailed plans on how submarines would prove more comfortable and safer to travel in than surface shipping.

The inflammation may cause pain and swelling. When the inflammation is caused by a blood clot or thrombus, it is called thrombophlebitis. Thrombophlebitis usually occurs in leg veins, but it may also affect the veins in the arms. [PAR] There are two sets of veins in the arms and legs, 1) the superficial veins that run just under the skin, and 2) the deep veins. [PAR] Superficial phlebitis affects veins on the skin surface. The condition is rarely serious and usually resolves with local treatment of the inflammation with warm compresses and anti-inflammatory medications. Sometimes superficial phlebitis can be associated with deep vein thrombophlebitis and medical evaluation may be needed.

The leaves typically are simple and have shallow toothed margins. The flowers usually have five pink or white petals that appear before leaves, but double petals and/or other colors are common in ornamental selections.

Divorce in England was also only considered valid at the time on the grounds of adultery, which was not the case for either of Mrs Simpson\u2019s two divorces (firstly from Earl Winfield Spencer Jr., secondly from Ernest Simpson), so there was the possibility of a court challenge declaring the divorces void. There was also the rumour that Mrs Simpson was a Nazi agent/sympathiser. This did not sit well with the British Government, which was already concerned with the King\u2019s interference in political matters. Opposition also came from the Royal Family and courtiers, who deemed Mrs Simpson \u2018unfit\u2019 to be Queen, based on her background and \u2018activities\u2019. [PAR] View the full image at RBA [PAR] Three options were surmised by the government as to what the outcome of the situation could be: marriage with full royal allowances (ie. Mrs Simpson becomes Queen), a morganatic marriage (ie. Mrs Simpson receives a secondary title, and does not become Queen), or abdication of the King and his future heirs. A meeting between the British government and representatives of the four British Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa (along with a representative of Ireland) found that only option three was acceptable. If the King truly wanted to marry Mrs Simpson, he had to give up the throne \u2013 which Edward VIII did shortly thereafter, decreeing in a speech following the official announcement that he could not perform his duties \u201cwithout the help and support of the woman I love.\u201d [PAR] View the full-size image at the National Archives Flickr [PAR] The \u2018Instrument of Abdication\u2019 was signed by Edward VIII on December 10 at his Fort Belvedere residence, in the presence of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke of York, The Duke of Gloucester and The Duke of Kent , the King\u2019s three younger brothers, who also signed the abdication document as witnesses. The document was then given to parliament, who gave their consent to the abdication, as did the Dominions (as was required at the time). King Edward VIII performed his final act as King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, Emperor of India by giving his royal assent to the Act of Parliament which allowed him to abdicate.

Thereafter did that combination never exist, at least not for the coming thirty years. [PAR] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The post-World War I period had been a time when the British operated old ships from the early 1910s. These ships were either British-built ships like the Olympic and Mauretania, or vessels seized by the British government from the defeated Germans - vessels such as Berengaria (ex-Imperator), Majestic (ex-Bismarck) and Homeric (ex-Columbus). These were all distinguished ships but as the 1920s came to an end, it was evident that the prime ships of the British merchant fleet were getting old. The prime ships in the world were now owned by the distinguished French Line (Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Transatlantique - C.G.T.) or the respected Norddeutscher Lloyd. The fabled luxury-liner \u00cele de France had entered the waves in 1927, and immediately become one of the most popular passenger vessels on the North Atlantic.

At the same time across the English Channel the French Line gave their order to build a ship bigger still at almost 1,030 feet.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Doughnut\"The Doughnut\" is the nickname given to the headquarters of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British cryptography and intelligence agency. It is located on a 176 acre site in Benhall, in the suburbs of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in South West England. The Doughnut houses 5,500 employees; GCHQ is the largest single employer in Gloucestershire. Built to modernise and consolidate GCHQ's multiple buildings in Cheltenham, The Doughnut was completed in 2003, and GCHQ moved into the building in 2004. It is the largest building constructed for secret intelligence operations outside the United States. The Doughnut was too small for the number of staff at its completion, and a second building in a secret and undisclosed location in the 'Gloucestershire area' now also accommodates staff from GCHQ. The Doughnut is surrounded by car and bicycle parking in concentric rings, and well protected by security. [PAR] The construction of the building was financed by a private finance initiative and construction costs were greatly increased after difficulties in transferring computer infrastructure to the building. The building is modern in design and built primarily from steel, aluminium, and stone. [PAR] Background [PAR] The construction of the Doughnut in 2003 consolidated the operations previously spread across two sites into a single location, replacing more than 50 buildings in the process. The last staff from the nearby GCHQ site at Oakley were transferred to the Doughnut in late 2011. [PAR] The design of the Doughnut reflects GCHQ's intended new mode of work after the end of the Cold War, with its design facilitating talking among staff, and between them and the Director of GCHQ and his subordinates. It was estimated that anyone in the building could reach any other worker within five minutes. The director of GCHQ has no office; in 2014 director Iain Lobban described his desk as being located \"within the shouting distance of lawyers\". [PAR] At a cost of \u00a3330m, the construction of the Doughnut was funded by a private finance initiative (PFI) put forward by a collective that included British facilities management and construction company Carillion, the Danish security company Group 4/Falck (now G4S), and the British telecommunications company BT Group. The consortium are scheduled to be paid \u00a3800m to maintain the Doughnut for 30 years. The creation of the Doughnut was the largest PFI project to date for the British government. The building was designed by the British architect Chris Johnson for the American architectural firm Gensler, and constructed and built by Carillion. [PAR] In 2004 the chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Edward Leigh, criticised the increasing cost of GCHQ's move to the Doughnut. Leigh said that \"It was astonishing GCHQ did not realise the extent of what would be involved much sooner\". Leigh had said in 2003 that GCHQ's original estimate for the cost of the move was \"staggeringly inaccurate\". [PAR] For security reasons, GCHQ moved its own computers and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut, which caused the cost of its move to increase from \u00a341m to \u00a3450m over two years. The moves of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost more than three times their original estimates due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid \u00a3216m toward a newly agreed budget of \u00a3308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate. [PAR] The complexity of the computer network at GCHQ was responsible for the increase in costs. Issues with the network were found while preparing computers for the \"Millennium bug\". Simply shutting down each computer individually before restarting them in the Doughnut would have left GCHQ unable to complete key intelligence work for two years, while moving their electronics according to the original schedule without \"unacceptable damage\" to intelligence gathering would cost \u00a3450m. In a review of GCHQ's move in 2003, the National Audit Office said government ministers might never have approved the consolidation of facilities had the final cost been known.

Falsely accused, cut off from his past, Silas the weaver is reduced to a spider-like existence, endlessly weaving his web and hoarding his gold. Meanwhile, Godfrey Cass, son of the squire, contracts a secret marriage. While the village celebrates Christmas and New Year, two apparently inexplicable events occur: Silas loses his gold and finds a child on his hearth. The imaginative control George Eliot displays as her narrative gradually reveals causes and connections has rarely been surpassed. Silas Marner (1861) is the shortest and most immediately accessible of Eliot's novels. She takes the materials of legend and fairy tale and provides them with a historically precise setting, drawing on some of the most advanced ideas of her day in order to represent states of mind and belief at the limits of rational perception. This edition, which is based on the carefully corrected text George Eliot prepared a few months after the first edition, is accompanied by an introduction which illuminates the intellectual context of what has often been presented as a nostalgic, sentimental tale.

[PAR] The tale of Silas Marner, the miser who loses his gold and gains a golden-haired child is heart-warming with none of the sentimentality that Dickens would have brought to the tale. Eliot can write about the rural working class and they live and breathe as real people; listen to the way the men talk in the village pub, the way kind Mrs Winthrop rambles around a subject. There is wry humour here and acute observation. Apparently, it was George Eliot's favourite of her own novels, though the way of life she describes had already been vanquished by the industrial revolution.

Threading has been used since ancient times in the Far-East and Middle-East, but has only  started to become a popular hair removal method in the West in latter years, since the pressure has become insanely intense to flaunt beautiful and hairless bodies to conform to aesthetical societal demands. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] How Threading Works [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Threading works by twisting a fine thread of cotton around an area of hair. One end of the cotton is held between the teeth and the other end is held by the fingers on the left hand. The rest of the thread is  held in the finders of the right hand and the loop in the middle becomes entwined amongst the hair. When the thread is twisted, it dislodges the strands of hair and pulls the individual hairs out at the roots. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The Advantages of Threading [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Despite its relative anonymity, threading has many benefits over other hair removal techniques. Because the thread of cotton pulls out numerous strands of hair at the same time, compared to plucking, tweezing  and sugaring treatments, which remove hairs one by one, threading is a much quicker hair removal technique. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] It is also an extremely hygienic method of hair removal, as all that is required is a piece of cotton  thread, which is disposed of after use. Because of the lack of sophisticated equipment required, threading does not have to take place at a salon and can be easily performed at home. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Although when it is carried  out by a professional, the procedure can take just minutes. Threading the eyebrows for example, will last approximately 15 minutes, compared to the arduously slow procedure of plucking, which can regularly take  between 30 to 45 minutes for a structured shape to be achieved. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Threading is an extremely precise way of removing unwanted hair which can result in a very neat and polished finish. Because it involves ripping  the hair from its natural lines it gives a more chiseled and defined look compared to other more random and sporadic hair removal methods such as waxing. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Although threading is not a permanent hair removal method  and usually results in re-growth appearing between two to five weeks later, when the hair does grow back it is regularly reported to be much finer, softer and sparser than the previous hair \u2013 a huge plus point  over the \u2018harsher\u2019 techniques, which result in more denser and coarser hair growing back. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Perhaps the biggest advantage of threading as a means of removing unwanted hair from the body is the fact that it is an  extremely safe method, and except from a slight reddening of the skin immediately after treatment, which usually disappears within less than an hour, very few unwelcome side effects have been reported. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Due to  the fact it rarely harms the skin, threading is a suitable method for people with sensitive skin and because it does not rely on harsh chemicals or any aggressive procedures, it is appropriate to be used on the  more sensitive areas of the face. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Another big advantage of this type of hair removal method is that unlike other some of the permanent techniques, such as laser treatments and flashlamps, threading can remove   all different colors and textures of hair. It can also remove any length of hair, from long, coarse pubic hair to shorter, stubbly hair, which gives threading a unique advantage over techniques such as waxing,   which requires the hair to be of a certain length. Also unlike waxing, threading can be used by people who are using vitamin A products, such as Retin A and Isoretinoin.

His death was also confirmed by his American publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Author of a wide range of books, Eco was fascinated with the obscure and the mundane, and his books were both engaging narratives and philosophical and intellectual exercises. The bearded, heavy-set scholar, critic and novelist took on the esoteric theory of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols in language; took on popular culture icons like James Bond; and took on the technical languages of the Internet. \"The Name of the Rose\" transformed him from an academic to international celebrity, especially after the medieval thriller set in a monastery was made into a film starring Sean Connery in 1986. \"The Name of the Rose\" sold millions of copies, a feat for a narrative filled with partially translated Latin quotes and puzzling musings on the nature of symbols. His second novel, the 1988 \"Foucault's Pendulum,\" a byzantine tale of plotting publishers and secret sects also styled as a thriller, was successful, too \u2014 though it was so complicated that an annotated guide accompanied it to help the reader follow the plot. In 2000, when awarding Eco Spain's prestigious Prince of Asturias Prize for communications, the jury praised his works \"of universal distribution and profound effect that are already classics in contemporary thought.\" Eco was born Jan. 5, 1932, in Alessandria, a town east of Turin. He said the reserved culture there was a source for his \"world vision: a skepticism and an aversion to rhetoric.\" He received a university degree in philosophy from the University of Turin in 1954, beginning his fascination with the Middle Ages and the aesthetics of text. He later defined semiotics as \"a philosophy of language.\" He had always loved storytelling and as a teenager wrote comic books and fantasy novels. \"I was a perfectionist and wanted to make them look as though they had been printed, so I wrote them in capital letters and made up title pages, summaries, illustrations,\" he told The Paris Review in 1988. \"It was so tiring that I never finished any of them. I was at that time a great writer of unaccomplished masterpieces.\" Eco remained involved with academia, becoming the first professor of semiotics at the University of Bologna in 1971. He also lectured at institutions worldwide and was a fellow at elite colleges like Oxford University and Columbia University. Twenty-three institutions had awarded him honorary degrees by 2000. But Eco was also able to bridge the gap between popular and intellectual culture, publishing his musings in daily newspapers and Italy's leading weekly magazine L'Espresso. Eco started in journalism in the 1950s, working for the Italian state-owned television RAI. From the 1960s onwards, he wrote columns for several Italian dailies. He also wrote children's books, including \"The Bomb and the General\" (\"La Bomba e il Generale\"). In 2003, Eco published a collection of lectures on translations, \"Mouse or Rat? Translation as Negotiation,\" and a year later he wrote the novel \"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana,\" a story about an antiquarian book dealer who loses his memory. Recent works include \"From the Tree to the Labyrinth,\" an essay on semiology and language published in 2007 and \"Turning Back the Clock,\" a collection of essays on various subjects, ranging from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to anti-Semitism and to staunch criticism of Silvio Berlusconi", "topic": "Evaluate the challenges and strategies Eco employed in \"Foucault's Pendulum\" to convey its complex narrative, noting the inclusion of an annotated guide for readers.", "question": "Eco's inclusion of an annotated guide with \"Foucault's Pendulum\" primarily served to address which core challenge inherent in the novel's structure and narrative ambition?", "choices": {"A": "To explicitly define the semiotic theories underpinning the plot's intricate symbolism.", "B": "To mitigate reader disorientation arising from the novel's deliberate fragmentation and encyclopedic scope.", "C": "To provide a historical context for the esoteric conspiracy theories depicted within the narrative.", "D": "To simplify the complex philosophical debates between the characters for broader accessibility."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The annotated guide was a direct response to the novel's intentionally convoluted structure and vast range of references, designed to help readers navigate its complexity rather than to over-explain philosophical concepts or historical background.", "question_token_count": 34, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 6, "avg_answer_token_count": 16}

According to German monograph Minderheitenrechte in Europa co-edited by Pan and Pfeil (2002) there are 87 distinct peoples of Europe, of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities. The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans.  [PAR] Modern ethnic Europeans are a recent and ongoing evolution. The original anatomically modern human migrants to Europe from Africa arrived 40,000 years ago; these prehistoric Europeans were predominantly dark skinned, short of stature, lactose intolerant, and looked dramatically different in comparison to modern Europeans. The genetic lineage of Europe mysteriously transformed about 4,500 years ago, with changes in diet, body size and skin pigmentation, when Central Asian and West Asian migrants arrived with taller height and light skin genes, respectively.   There is no precise or universally accepted definition of the terms \"ethnic group\" or \"nationality\". In the context of European ethnography in particular, the terms ethnic group, people (without nation state), nationality, national minority, ethnic minority, linguistic community, linguistic group, linguistic minority and genetic haplogroup are used as mostly synonymous, although preference may vary in usage with respect to the situation specific to the individual countries of Europe.  [PAR] Overview [PAR] There are eight peoples of Europe (defined by their language) with more than 30 million members residing in Europe.

[PAR] About 20\u201325 million residents  (3%) are members of diasporas of non-European origin. The population of the European Union, with some five hundred million residents, accounts for two thirds of the European population.

His       father managed a dairy, and as a boy he would often assist him with the       early morning milk delivery rounds. Sumner was raised in the Roman       Catholic tradition, due to the influence of his paternal grandmother,       who was from an Irish family. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] He attended       St.       Cuthbert's Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, and then the University       of Warwick in Coventry,       which he left after only one term.

After jobs as a bus       conductor, a construction labourer and a tax officer, he attended Northern       Counties Teachers' Training College, which later became part of Northumbria       University, from 1971 to 1974.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Weather In FuerteventuraWeather In Fuerteventura [PAR] Jandia Golf Course [PAR] The weather in Fuerteventura is unlike any of the other\u00a0 \u00a0Canary Islands . It sits in the Atlantic, 108 km from the northwest mainland African coast. The weather it experiences is quite unique.\u00a0Fuerteventura and its neighbouring islands have been called 'the island of eternal spring' because of their pleasant weather throughout the year. There isn't an enormous amount of annual temperature variation. The thermometer sits around the mid twenties year round. There is still a distinction between the 'summer' and 'winter' months, but the island very rarely experiences temperature extremes. [PAR] On the whole, it is thought that the northern shores of each of the\u00a0 \u00a0Canary Islands \u00a0(\u00a0 Tenerife ,\u00a0 Gran Canaria , Lanzarote, La Palma,\u00a0 La Gomera , El Hierro, Fuerteventura and La Graciosa) generally receive more rain than that of the sheltered southern coasts of the islands. However, due to its proximity to Lanzarote which lies 12 minutes by boat to its north,\u00a0Fuerteventura\u00a0is somewhat sheltered from various weather conditions that would typically hit the north side of the island. So in a sense,\u00a0 Lanzarote\u00a0 \u00a0acts as the northern coast of\u00a0Fuerteventura\u00a0which results in the island receiving significantly less annual rainfall than its neighbouring islands. [PAR] On the whole\u00a0Fuerteventura\u00a0is generally cooler in summer than nearby summer resorts, so you may find many people flocking to the island to escape from the harsh heat of the Spanish mainland. The winter sees the island warmer than\u00a0 Majorca\u00a0 \u00a0and other Spanish resorts, and it is not uncommon for the beaches to still be filled with tourists sun baking even in the cooler winter months. [PAR] SUMMER [PAR] The summer months of June to August see an\u00a0 \u00a0average temperature \u00a0of 27\u00baC, this average can be misleading as it has been known to reach highs of 40\u00baC in the height of summer. Its proximity to the African coastline ensures that the island sees plenty of sunshine year round-\u00a0Fuerteventura\u00a0boasts an average of 320 days of sunshine per year. Generally the summer highs will average 29\u00baC to 30\u00baC, with low humidity and scarce\u00a0 \u00a0rainfall . At night time the temperature falls to low twenties which provide for an enjoyable atmosphere to kick back and enjoy the island lifestyle. [PAR] The name 'Fuerteventura' translates to 'strong wind' which is certainly a characteristic of the island. The Canary Islands as a whole are in the path of the regular north-eastern trade wind and the cool Canary Stream, but\u00a0Fuerteventura\u00a0in particular is dominated by this. The breeze does provide a welcome cooling relief from the sometimes scorching mid-summer temperatures. Because of its location in the path of trade winds, the island is a great destination for those wishing to revel in wind-powered sports. [PAR] As the Canary Islands sit in the vast Atlantic Ocean in the cooling Canary Current, the water temperature does not reach the highs of the Mediterranean or more easterly waters. In the warmest of the summer weather, in August and September, the average water temperature reaches 21\u00baC, a good 4\u00baC below what might be expected somewhere like\u00a0 Mallorca \u00a0at the same time of year. Clearly, anything in the 20s is more than bearable and would provide a refreshing break from the heat of the day. [PAR] May through until August sees\u00a0Fuerteventura\u00a0experiencing very low rainfall amounts and an average of eleven hours of\u00a0 sunshine \u00a0each day. If you want to avoid the peak summer crowds of July and August then May and June are an ideal time to visit the island. The weather is gorgeous - not too hot but still baking and room to spread out on the beach. [PAR] WINTER [PAR] The only period that you can really expect to experience bad weather is during the months of\u00a0 December\u00a0 \u00a0to\u00a0 \u00a0March , where it is possible to experience an entire week of wet, windy weather. In saying this, it is highly unlikely that these periods will last for longer than a week at a time. In addition to this, the rain is generally localized around the northern parts of the island.

In 1619, Berkeley Hundred was the site of America's first Thanksgiving Day. It later became known as Berkeley Plantation, and was long the traditional home of the Harrison family, one of the First Families of Virginia. [PAR] History [PAR] Berkeley Hundred was a land grant in 1618 of the Virginia Company of London to Sir William Throckmorton, Sir George Yeardley, George Thorpe, Richard Berkeley, and John Smyth (1567\u20131641) of Nibley. Smyth was also the historian of the Berkeley group, collecting over 60 documents relating to the settlement of Virginia between 1613 and 1634 which have survived to modern times. [PAR] In 1619, the ship Margaret of Bristol, England sailed for Virginia under Captain John Woodliffe and brought thirty-eight settlers to the new Town and Hundred of Berkeley. The proprietors instructed the settlers of \"the day of our ships arrival . . . shall be yearly and perpetually kept as a day of Thanksgiving.\" The Margaret landed her passengers at Berkeley Hundred on December 4, 1619. The settlers did indeed celebrate a day of \"Thanksgiving\", establishing the tradition two years and 17 days before the Pilgrims arrived aboard the Mayflower at Plymouth, Massachusetts to establish their Thanksgiving Day in 1621.  [PAR] On March 22, 1622, Opchanacanough, head of the Powhatan Confederacy, began the Second Anglo-Powhatan War with a coordinated series of attacks against English settlements along the James River, known in English histories as the Indian massacre of 1622. Nine colonists were killed at Berkeley. The assault took a heavier toll elsewhere, killing about a third of all the colonists, and virtually wiping out Wolstenholme Towne on Martin's Hundred and Sir Thomas Dale's progressive development and new college at Henricus. Jamestown was spared through a timely warning and became the refuge for many survivors who abandoned outlying settlements. A myth about the March 22 date was that it occurred on Good Friday.  This is incorrect.  [PAR] For several years, thereafter, the plantation at Berkeley Hundred lay abandoned, until William Tucker and others got possession of it in 1636, and it became the property of John Bland, a merchant of London. By this time, the area had become part of Charles City Shire in 1634, later renamed Charles City County. [PAR] Giles Bland, son of John Bland, inherited it, but he was hanged by Governor Sir William Berkeley in 1676, after participating in Bacon's Rebellion. Confiscated by Governor Berkeley, the land was purchased in 1691 by Benjamin Harrison (1673\u20131710), attorney general of the colony, treasurer and speaker of the House of Burgesses.

It is also the truth behind the music that a Zulu choir brought out of South Africa into recording and concert prominence in the United States. The ten members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo were the best-selling group in the Union of South Africa. After their participation in Paul Simon's 1986 Graceland album and tour, they became popular recording artists in the United States and worldwide. [PAR] The group, led by Joseph Shabalala, present a Zulu harmonic and variation style known as mbube. Stefan Grossman, distributor of the group's albums on Shanachie Records and a major influence on the rise of knowledgeable audiences for African music in America, described their style as \"a timeless beauty that transcends culture, language and all other artificial barriers dividing humanity.\" American audiences, attracted by the beat and the shifting harmonies, have purchased Ladysmith Black Mambazo's own four albums, Induku Zethu, Umthombo Wamanzi, Ulwande Olungwele, and Inala, in greater and greater numbers. [PAR] The group began in 1964, when Joseph Shabalala dreamed of pure vocal harmonies in the style known as isicathamiya, originated by black workers in the South African mines. Impoverished and far from their families, they entertained themselves after six-day work weeks by singing. When they returned to their homes, they brought this music with them, and the fierce vocal and musical competitions among groups became a much-loved feature of local life. When Shabalala returned to his home town of Ladysmith after working in a factory in Durban, he founded his own singing group. In 1964, after hearing the music in his dream, he taught it to the members of his group, and after they incorporated it, they won almost every singing competition they entered. He named his group Ladysmith Black Mambazo after his hometown; \"black\" is a reference to a black ox, considered to be the strongest kind; and \"mambazo\" means \"axe\" symbolizing the group's skill in \"chopping down\" their musical competitors. They were so good at winning, in fact, that they were eventually banned from competing, but they were welcome to perform at any competition. [PAR] In 1970 they won their first record contract after a radio performance. In 1975, Shabalala converted to Christianity, and the group released their first Christian album, Ukukhanya Kwelanga. After this, the group's music was based largely on Methodist hymns, and their 1976 album, Ukusindiswa, became a popular religious album in South Africa. The group first traveled outside South Africa in 1981, when the government of South Africa allowed them to go to Germany to perform. [PAR] World Recognition [PAR] However, it was not until the release of the Graceland album in 1986, with its subsequent tour and television special, that most North Americans got to know Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Paul Simon heard the group when he was considering which of many African musical ensembles to include in his 1986 album (which was recorded in London). He selected the group, along with Tao Ea Matsekha, the Boyoyo Boys and others, as examples of the \"mbaqanga\" sound (roughly translatable as \"township jive\"). The sound had political connotations within Africa and, as Simon recognized, the music had an attractive beat with international appeal. The group's cuts on the Graceland album, \"Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes\" and \"Homeless\" (by Simon and Shabalala), were tremendously successful, as were Ladysmith's promotional performances with Simon on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" and their participation in the Graceland concerts.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Tourette Syndrome (Tourette Disorder) Guide: Causes ...Tourette Syndrome (Tourette Disorder) Guide: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment Options [PAR] Tourette Syndrome [PAR] What Is It? [PAR] Tourette syndrome (TS) is a problem of the nervous system that was first described by the French neurologist, Gilles de la Tourette, more than 125 years ago. [PAR] The major symptom is tics. Tics are sudden, brief, involuntary or semi-voluntary movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). [PAR] To make a diagnosis of TS, a person must have many motor tics and at least one vocal tic, almost every day for more than a year. [PAR] A person who has a tic does not necessarily have TS. Tics are, in fact, relatively common. They occur most often from age 9 to 11, in up to 10% of children. In contrast, the full Tourette syndrome is much less common, occurring in less than 1%. Boys are affected three times more often than girls. TS is also more common in children with autism or Asperger syndrome. [PAR] Tourette syndrome has a strong genetic component, although the genetic mechanisms are not yet known. As with many other illnesses, TS will probably not turn out to be a single condition with one cause. Rather, it is likely to have multiple causes. [PAR] If someone has TS, the chance that someone else in the immediate family has tics is about 25%. Up to 90% of identical twins are affected. Environmental factors probably play a role in the development of TS (for example, stress or infection), but these causes are not well defined. [PAR] TS often is accompanied by other behavioral or emotional problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, learning difficulties, sleep problems, depression and anxiety. [PAR] Symptoms [PAR] Tics are involuntary and usually sudden, rapid and repetitive. They appear in a variety of forms. No two people with Tourette syndrome have the same symptoms. [PAR] Tics become worse with anxiety, excitement, anger or fatigue and can get better during absorbing activities or sleep. Some people with TS describe an urge or warning sign before a tic. They may be able to suppress tics briefly. [PAR] Tics can be either simple or complex. [PAR] Simple motor tics. These tics involve just one muscle group. Examples are an eye blink, a head jerk or a shoulder shrug. [PAR] Complex motor tics. These tics use more muscles groups. The face or body may contort. The person may touch someone, sniff, jump or make an obscene gesture. [PAR] Sometimes a person will make a voluntary movement to cover up the tic, for example, a head thrust followed by smoothing the hair. Simple vocal tics include such sounds as grunting, barking, yelping and throat clearing. [PAR] During complex vocal tics, a person with TS may repeat his or her own words, repeat another person's words, or say obscene words or phrases. When obscenity is part of the tic, it is quite upsetting, but this probably occurs in no more than 10% of cases. [PAR] Diagnosis [PAR] The most dramatic symptoms are easy to notice, but the disorder can be difficult to recognize. People with mild to moderate tics may be too embarrassed to discuss their problems. Parents and teachers usually pay more attention to behavior, learning and attention problems than to tics. Also, sometimes tics are mistaken for other medical problems. For example, people might consult an allergist for sniffling or an eye doctor for unusual eye movements. [PAR] The disorder is diagnosed by observing the tics. If they do not occur frequently enough for a doctor to notice them during a routine visit, a family member or friend needs to describe them. A video can be very helpful. Sometimes, to help define the problem, a doctor asks a family member to fill out a questionnaire. [PAR] There is no blood test for Tourette syndrome. A physical examination and X-rays are usually normal. A physician may also look for other causes of tics, such as infection, medications or head injury.

[PAR] The Yellow Jersey [PAR] So let\u2019s start with the most famous piece of clothing in sport: the yellow jersey , or \u2018maillot jaune\u2019 to give it its French title. The yellow jersey is worn by the rider leading the overall or general classification at the start of that day\u2019s stage \u2014 essentially, the rider with the lowest aggregate total time for all the days raced so far. The rider with the lowest aggregate time when the race reaches its finale in Paris after three weeks is the ultimate race winner and yellow jersey holder. However, anybody who has worn a yellow jersey at any time during the Tour gets to keep the garment as a very special souvenir of their achievement. For example, Eddy Merckx was awarded 96 yellow jerseys during his career because he spent 96 days leading the Tour. [PAR] But it hasn\u2019t always been like this. When the Tour de France first started way back in 1903, the leader of the race only wore a yellow armband to signify his position. The yellow jersey itself didn\u2019t come into Tour de France life until 1919, and the first wearer was French rider Eug\u00e8ne Christophe So why yellow? Well here\u2019s a little bit of interesting Tour trivia. The Tour de France was created by L\u2019Auto newspaper as a way to promote the journal, and L\u2019Auto was famously painted on yellow paper. So the yellow jersey was originally nothing more noble than a blatant marketing exercise. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The Polka-Dot Jersey [PAR] Probably the next most identifiable piece of Tour de France clothing is the polka-dot jersey \u00a0or \u2018King of the Mountains\u2019 jersey.

All significant climbs on the Tour de France route are graded from category four for the least taxing, right up to \u2018hors category\u2019 for the true mountains. The riders who cross the summit line first are awarded points \u2014 the tougher the climb, the more riders who will win more points. The rider with the most accumulated points at the start of the day wins the right to wear the legendary polka-dot jersey for that day\u2019s stage. [PAR] The polka-dot jersey might be the second most recognisable jersey in the Tour but it\u2019s actually the jersey with only the third oldest provenance; both the yellow and green jerseys were around before it. Although the mountain competition came into being at the 1933 Tour, there was no jersey awarded to denote the classification leader until 1975. Since then, though, the white and red-spotted jersey has been ever present. Why red polka-dots on a white background? Need you ask? It\u2019s all down to the sponsor at the time \u2014 Chocolat Poulain \u2014 who covered its chocolate bars in polka-dot wrappers.

The major discovery of silver, known as the Comstock Lode, happened a decade later in 1859 and brought great changes to the area as miners rushed into the region and boom towns including Virginia City, Aurora, Unionville and Austin were born. Over the next 20 years, almost $1 billion of gold and silver were produced by Nevada mines. The wealth of Nevada mines, the population surge they created and the ongoing American Civil War prompted Abraham Lincoln to declare Nevada the 36th state in the Union on Oct. 31, 1864. [PAR] By the 1890s, however, the production of gold and silver had slowed significantly and one in three Nevadans left the new state in search of jobs. This lull in the Nevada mining industry would prove to be short-lived, though. The turn of the twentieth century would see several new strikes throughout the state. Silver at Tonopah, gold at Goldfield and copper in White Pine County all contributed to an upswing in mining production. [PAR] In 1912, the Nevada Mining Association, then known as the Nevada Mine Operaters Association, was established as the collective body for the mining industry in the state. Mining\u2019s importance to the state and nation continued into the 1910s with the fighting of World War I (1914-18), and Nevada\u2019s mines sold millions of dollars worth of copper, silver and lead to make weapons.

[PAR] Obviously, much has changed since the origins of Nevada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The average price of gas in 1919 was $.25 a gallon, a loaf bread was $.10 and life expectancy for men hovered around 48 years of age.

[PAR] Enno van Gelder in his book \"De Nederlandse Munten\" notes that the first pieces larger than a penny (\"sterling\") in the 13th century were the Venetian grosso  (meaning \"large\" or \"thick\"), followed by the French gros tournois, tariffed  at 12 deniers tournois.  This piece circulated in Holland, where it was known as the groot (also, conveniently, Dutch for \"great\" or \"large\").  There may be a Dutch intermediary between the French and the English use of the word. The OED (the big one) notes that the mediaeval Latin word grossus and old French word gros are recorded before the Teutonic forms and suggests that the adoption of the Dutch form into English is a sign that the coins from the Low Countries circulated in Britain before the home types were struck. [PAR] I am grateful to Martin Purdy of Wellington, New Zealand for bringing this information to my attention. [PAR] The first English groats were copied from the Continental gros tournois, and were issued during the reign of Edward I in 1279.  This first issue of groats weighed 89 grains, representing a penny weight of 22.25 grains, a slight reduction on the previous weight of 22.5 grains, but were not particularly popular. [PAR] The groat became more established after they were reissued in 1351 by Edward III with a lower weight of 72 grains.  The design changed relatively little during the next 150 years, although there was a reduction in weight to 60 grains in 1412 during the reign of Henry IV, and again to 48 grains in 1464 during the reign of Edward IV. Click here for  an image of an Henry VI groat which is typical of the early groat design. I am grateful to Jean ELSEN & ses Fils for permission to use this image, which is of an early Annulet issue of the Calais Mint. [PAR] Eventually the design was changed in 1502, when a profile portrait of Henry VII was used. [PAR] The first issues of Henry VIII continued to use the portrait of Henry VII from 1509 to 1526, when a new issue with his own portrait was made.  From 1544 the fineness of the silver was steadily debased from the normal .925 fine down to .333 fine. [PAR] During the reign of Edward VI the standard of the silver coinage was raised again, but the groat was not struck to this new standard until the reign of Mary I .  A Philip and Mary groat is also illustrated. [PAR] Elizabeth I had several developments during her reign.  Firstly, from 1559 to 1560 the groat was struck with a fineness of .916 and weighed 32 grains.  In 1560 the fineness was  increased further to .925, keeping the same weight.  In 1561 a new issue was made, but the  groat was replaced by the sixpence, and did not reappear.  It is about this time that the word fourpence came to replace the word groat. [PAR] The milled version of the groat was produced by Eloi Mestrell at the same time as the hammered issues. [PAR] The hammered fourpence was issued for Maundy purposes until 1662 during the reign of Charles II, but was not generally used for circulation, as far as I can tell. [PAR] After 1662 a milled issue was made fairly regularly until the reign of George III.  The crowned numeral first appeared in 1686 when the roman numeral IIII was used as a pun on Iacobus for James II.  On the accession of William and Mary the arabic number 4 was used instead, and the basic design has not changed since (although the details have of course). [PAR] After the reign of George III the crowned 4 type was issued exclusively for use in the Maundy ceremony, and is  still issued up until the present day, although revalued as 4 new pence on decimalisation in 1971.

The Holland VI was the inventor's greatest achievement and the most advanced submarine design in the world at the time. [PAR] John Philip Holland, from Clare, was part of an elite group of Irish engineers and scientists who made momentous advances in the development of submarine technology. That group includes Howard Grubb who perfected the design of the submarine periscope and Louis Brennan who designed the first proper steerable torpedo. Holland not only shares his Irish birth with these inventors but he also shares an undeserved anonymity, for John Philip Holland was the most important pioneer in the development of the modern submarine. In 1862, while living in Cork City, Holland was transfixed by newspaper reports of the Battle of Hampton Roads, a naval engagement in the American Civil War. The accounts of the battle and its ironclad warships were to set Holland on a long and torturous journey of invention. It would end with Holland\u2019s designs forming the basis for the US navy\u2019s first submarine fleet and then for submarine navies throughout the world. [PAR] Courage and Conflicts\u00a0details Holland\u2019s time in Ireland and how, in 1873, he left for the US. From then onwards, Holland\u2019s life would swing from glorious highs to dispiriting lows. The book tells of how he initially made his name by building a submarine for the Irish revolutionary group, the Fenians. It was from this relationship that the so-called \u2018Fenian Ram\u2019; a boat that the Fenians hoped would cripple the British Royal Navy. This period was an extraordinary time in his life, with Fenian intrigues, British spies and foreign diplomats all impinging upon Holland's work. His relationship with the Fenians would end rancorously but Holland had made a name for himself in naval circles. By the mid 1890\u2019s Holland was involved in a project with the US navy and in 1897 he launched the submarine that was to make his name, the \u2018Holland VI\u2019. Great success, unfortunately, often attracts avarice and Holland would fall prey to his business partners. Ultimately, Holland would lose control of the patents on his designs. Nevertheless, he would continue to push back the technical boundaries of underwater technology and through a varied career would even create submarines for the Japanese government. The company he helped found, the Electric Boat Company, would flourish and eventually become General Dynamics Corporation. [PAR] Holland\u2019s story is that of an emigrant who, through sheer ability and hard-work, made a profound difference in his chosen field. Yet, his aims were not entirely militaristic. He spoke at length of his belief that the submarine, by ending the naval dominance of the world\u2019s great powers, would make the\u00a0oceans safe for all.This was a theme that he would return to many times as when he told Thomas Edison that, in building submarines, he was \u2018animated with the desire of helping to end naval warfare\u2019. He was a fervent proponent of the use of submarines in commercial and public transport. He left detailed plans on how submarines would prove more comfortable and safer to travel in than surface shipping. We know that history did not transpire in such a manner but Holland was a true visionary and a great inventor.[DOC] [TLE] Communicate Science: The Irish Submarine Pioneer: John ...Communicate Science: The Irish Submarine Pioneer: John Philip Holland [PAR] The Irish Submarine Pioneer: John Philip Holland [PAR] Holland at the", "topic": "Analyze the significance of the Battle of Hampton Roads in shaping John Philip Holland's career trajectory and technological pursuits.", "question": "How did the Battle of Hampton Roads most profoundly shape John Philip Holland's enduring technological objectives beyond the initial impetus to build submarines?", "choices": {"A": "It primarily inspired Holland to focus on developing ironclad warships, mirroring the vessels involved in the battle.", "B": "It fostered a belief that submarines could challenge naval dominance, ultimately leading him to advocate for their use in commercial transport and a reduction in naval warfare.", "C": "It motivated him to collaborate with the Fenians to build a submarine capable of directly replicating the tactics employed during the battle.", "D": "It spurred him to prioritize speed and maneuverability in submarine design, reflecting the agility displayed by the Confederate ironclads."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states Holland believed submarines, by ending the naval dominance of great powers, could make oceans safe and advocated for their use in commercial transport \u2013 a direct consequence of his initial reaction to the Battle of Hampton Roads.", "question_token_count": 28, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 27}

[PAR] by Jaime McLeod | Monday, August 22nd, 2011 | From: Astronomy [PAR] The Debate Over Pluto: Is It A Planet Or Not? [PAR] When Pluto was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006, astronomers began thinking in a new way about its largest moon, Charon. [PAR] Charon was the first of Pluto\u2019s four moons to be discovered, and its largest. Charon is believed to be more than half the diameter of Pluto. Because Charon is so large in comparison to Pluto, the two bodies actually revolve around one another, instead of Charon revolving around Pluto, as once believed. For this reason, some astronomers have proposed upgrading Charon to the status of dwarf planet. [PAR] Here are some more interesting facts about Charon: [PAR] \u2013 Charon was first discovered on June 22, 1978, by astronomer James Christy at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station. The moon (or dwarf planet, as the case may be) was first seen as a bulge appearing on some photos of Pluto. The bulge wasn\u2019t confirmed to be a moon until nearly a decade later, when the two bodies entered a period of eclipsing one another. [PAR] \u2013 The surface of Charon probably a rocky core surrounded by an icy outer layer, similar to Pluto. The moon is believed to feature numerous active volcanoes that spew ammonia-rich water. [PAR] \u2013 Astronomers do not know the composition of Charon\u2019s atmosphere, or if it even has one. Many unknown details will become clearer in 2015, when New Horizons, the first spacecraft sent to explore Pluto and its moons, arrives at its destination. [PAR] \u2013 Charon is about 750 miles in diameter, just over half the size of Pluto. [PAR] \u2013 It takes Pluto and Charon about 248 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun, and about 6.5 Earth days to revolve around one another. [PAR] \u2013 The average distance between Charon and Pluto 12,160 miles. [PAR] \u2013 Charon takes its name from the mythological ferryman who carried the dead across the River Styx to the realm of Hades (Pluto to the Romans), god of the underworld. Christy chose it because of its similarity to a nickname he had for his wife, Charlene. [PAR] \u2013 The average surface temperature on Charon is around -390\u00b0 F, a little colder than Pluto\u2019s. [PAR] \u2013 In addition to Charon, Pluto has three other moons, Nix, Hydra, and the as-yet-unnamed P4 (S/2011 P 1). Because Pluto and Charon revolve around one another, these other three moons orbit both bodies. [PAR] \u2013 Charon cannot be seen with the naked eye, or with most consumer grade telescopes. It can really only be observed with some of the most powerful telescopes in the world. The first clear images of it were taken from space by the Hubble Space telescope. [PAR] Whether Charon remains a moon or is eventually upgraded to a dwarf planet, it remains one of the most interesting objects in our solar system.

The majority of  students support this programme.\" [PAR] Ceri Thomas, the Head of BBC News Programmes, said the  students had been told twice about the possible dangers of  having a journalist on the trip, but were not informed about the  broadcaster's plans to make an undercover film because it would  have put them in a worse position had the BBC team been found  out.

[PAR] And, far from the full-time dedicated sportsmen and women of today, the man who won three gold medals at the 1908 London Olympics trained in his lunch break, swimming in the reservoir near the Oldham mill where he worked full-time as a piecer. [PAR] In the evenings, Taylor could be seen dodging the pleasure boats, ploughing up and down the Alexandra Park boating lake. [PAR] Taylor won gold, silver and bronze medals at the 1906 Interim Olympic Games in Athens in 1906, a bronze at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, and a bronze at Antwerp in 1920.

[PAR] As a gifted and diligent amateur, Taylor summed up the founding principles of the modern Olympics. And he merits special mention in a new book The British Olympics: Britain's Olympic heritage 1612-2012 by Martin Polley. [PAR] Polley, a senior lecturer in sport at Southampton University, argues that Britain above all other nations shaped the Olympic ideal of which Henry Taylor became a prime example. [PAR] He describes a series of British \u201colympics\u201d down the centuries, and recounts how the founder of the modern Olympics Baron Pierre de Coubertin came to Britain seeking ideas to be applied to the French education system, but came away persuaded of the need for an international revival of the Olympic games (see panel).

[PAR] But we did carry on competing. And the Olympics evolved, its strict amateur principles gradually relaxed, because of the dominance of competitors fostered by the Soviet military and the US college system from the 1950s onwards, to the point that many competitors now are full-time sportsmen and women.

The destruction of enemy shipping by German U-boats was a spectacular feature of both World Wars I and II. [PAR] Launching of U-218 at Kiel, Germany, in 1941. [PAR] From J.P. Mallmann Showell, U-Boats under the Swastika (1987) [PAR] World War I [PAR] Germany was the first country to employ submarines in war as substitutes for surface commerce raiders. At the outset of World War I , German U-boats, though numbering only 38, achieved notable successes against British warships; but because of the reactions of neutral powers (especially the United States) Germany hesitated before adopting unrestricted U-boat warfare against merchant ships. The decision to do so in February 1917 was largely responsible for the entry of the United States into the war. The U-boat campaign then became a race between German sinkings of merchant ships and the building of ships, mainly in the United States, to replace them. In April 1917, 430 Allied and neutral ships totaling 852,000 tons were sunk, and it seemed likely that the German gamble would succeed. However, the introduction of convoys , the arrival of numerous U.S. destroyers , and the vast output of American shipyards turned the tables. By the end of the war Germany had built 334 U-boats and had 226 under construction. The peak U-boat strength of 140 was reached in October 1917, but there were never more than about 60 at sea at one time. In 1914\u201318 the destruction\u2014more than 10,000,000 tons\u2014caused by the U-boats was especially remarkable in view of the small size (less than l,000 tons), frailty, and vulnerability of the craft. [PAR] World War II [PAR] The Armistice terms of 1918 required Germany to surrender all its U-boats, and the Treaty of Versailles forbade it to possess them in the future. In 1935, however, Adolf Hitler \u2019s Germany repudiated the treaty and forcefully negotiated the right to build U-boats. Britain was ill-prepared in 1939 for a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, and during the early months of World War II the U-boats, which at that time numbered only 57, again achieved great successes. The first phase, during which the U-boats generally operated singly, ended in March 1941, by which time many merchant ships were sailing in convoy, trained escort groups were becoming available, and aircraft were proving their effectiveness as anti-U-boat weapons. In the next phase the Germans, having acquired air and U-boat bases in Norway and western France, were able to reach much farther out into the Atlantic , and their U-boats began to operate in groups (called wolf packs by the British). One U-boat would shadow a convoy and summon others by radio, and then the group would attack, generally on the surface at night. These tactics succeeded until radar came to the aid of the escorts and until convoys could be given continuous sea and air escort all the way across the Atlantic in both directions. In March 1943, as in April 1917, the Germans nearly succeeded in cutting Britain\u2019s Atlantic lifeline, but by May escort carriers and very-long-range reconnaissance bombers became available. After the U-boats lost 41 of their number during that month, they withdrew temporarily from the Atlantic.

Also known simply as the NASDAQ, which originally stood for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, its 1971 creation offered an alternative to the in-person stock transaction system, which the NASD believed burdened investors with inefficient trading and delays. [PAR] Makeup of the NASDAQ [PAR] The NASDAQ now contains about 3,200 publicly traded companies, and is the second largest stock exchange (in terms of its securities' values) and the largest electronic stock market. The NASDAQ trades shares in a variety of types of companies \u2014 including capital goods, consumer durables and non-durables, energy, finance, healthcare, public utilities, technology, and transportation \u2014 but it is most well-known for its high-tech stocks. [PAR] To be listed on the NASDAQ National Market, companies must meet specific financial criteria. They must maintain a stock price of at least $1, and the value of outstanding stocks must total at least $1.1 million. For smaller companies unable to meet the financial requirements, there is the NASDAQ Small Caps Market. NASDAQ will shift companies from market to market as eligibility changes. [PAR] Trading on the NASDAQ [PAR] Because it is an electronic exchange, the NASDAQ offers no trading floor. The exchange itself is a dealers' market, so brokers buy and sell stocks through a market maker rather than from each other directly. A market maker handles a specific stock and holds a certain amount of stock in his or her books. When a broker wants to purchase shares, he or she does it directly from the market maker. [PAR] When the NASDAQ first began, stock trading took place over a computer bulletin board system and over the telephone. Now, trading on the NASDAQ occurs using automated trading systems, which offer full reports on trades and on daily trading volumes. Automated trading also offers automatic execution of trades based on parameters set by the trader. [PAR] The listing fees on the NASDAQ are significantly lower than other stock markets, with the maximum price set at $150,000. This low fee enables the trading of many new, high growth, and volatile stocks. [PAR] While the New York Stock Exchange is still considered a bigger exchange because its market capitalization is much higher, the NASDAQ has a greater trading volume than any other U.S. exchange, with approximately 1.8 billion trades per day. [PAR] With no trading floor, NASDAQ built the NASDAQ MarketSite in Manhattan's Times Square to create a tangible physical presence. The large outdoor electronic display gives current financial information on the tower 24 hours a day. Trading takes place Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time, except for major holidays. [PAR] NASDAQ indexes [PAR] Like any stock exchange, the NASDAQ uses an index, or a collection of stocks that are used to deliver a market performance snapshot. The NYSE offers the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) as its primary index, and NASDAQ offers the NASDAQ Composite and the NASDAQ 100. [PAR] The NASDAQ Composite Index measures the change in more than 3,000 stocks traded on NASDAQ, whereas the DJIA measures the peaks and troughs of 30 big companies. The NASDAQ Composite is often referred to as just \"the NASDAQ\" and is the index most often quoted by financial journalists and reporters. [PAR] The NASDAQ 100 is a modified capitalization-weighted index made up of the 100 largest companies in market value that trade on the NASDAQ. These companies cover a range of market sectors, though the largest are generally technology-related. Companies can be added and removed each year from the NASDAQ 100 depending on their market value.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Black Beauty by Anna Sewell | Featured Books : Stella ...Black Beauty by Anna Sewell | Featured Books  : Stella & Rose's Books [PAR] Black Beauty by\u2026 [PAR] Black Beauty by Anna Sewell [PAR] 'Black Beauty - the Autobiography of a Horse' by\u00a0Anna Sewell\u00a0was originally published in 1877 by Jarrolds and was the author's first and only book. It was written between 1871 and 1877 and, due to Anna's ill health, partly written with the help of her mother who transcribed her dictated words or pieces written on small slips of paper. [PAR] Greatly influenced by her love of\u00a0horses\u00a0due to her heavy use of\u00a0horse-drawn carriages\u00a0as a result of a lameness incurred during her teenage years, Anna wanted to bring the cruel treatment of the creatures into the public eye and encourage a more humane treatment of them. She accomplished this by writing the book in the first person from the viewpoint of the horse we know as 'Black Beauty', although throughout the book he also has a variety of different names from his various homes, including \"Black Auster\" and \"Jack\". Through Beauty's eyes and experiences, along with accounts from other horses that he meets on the way, Anna creates an empathy with the horses and the treatment that they have to endure.\u00a0 [PAR] We meet Black Beauty at his first home (right) with Farmer Grey, a good man who treats his horses kindly and trains them well. Black Beauty's mother 'Pet' also has a great influence on her son's character, giving him advice on how a horse should act even when under great strain, or when being treated badly. She says: '... I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways. Do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick, even in play'. Later on, before Beauty is sold on to Birtwick Park , he reflects on what his mother has taught him - 'She told me the better I behaved the better I should be treated, and it was wisest always to do my best to please my master'.\u00a0 [PAR] Throughout the book we see that Black Beauty really takes to heart this advice from his mother and tries to make the best of any situation in which he finds himself. An example of this is with Reuben Smith who, despite being a good stableman, rides Beauty under the influence of alcohol and doesn't notice that the horse's shoe is coming off. This leads to Beauty's injured knees and hoof but he says that 'horses are used to bearing their pain in silence'. [PAR] The chapters in the book are short and each tell of a different event in Beauty's life, with some characters reappearing and playing a bigger role than others, such as Beauty's friend Ginger, who has had a very bad life before they meet at Birtwick Park. [PAR] Through some of these characters, and indeed Beauty himself, many equestrian terms are explained to those of us who may not know or understand them - for example the 'breaking in' of a horse or the cruel use of 'bearing reins', which Sewell herself was very much against. In chapter eleven it talks about 'the mistress', if she 'met a heavily-laden horse with his head strained up, she would stop the carriage and get out and reason with the driver in her sweet serious voice, and try to show him how foolish and cruel it was'. When reading this, it feels like Sewell is actually talking to you and giving you her feelings on the subject.\u00a0 [PAR] Further cruelties and ill-treatments of horses are explored, for example, Sir Oliver 'losing' his tail, by having it cut off 'for fashion'. Sewell looks at this from the horse's point of view with Sir Oliver saying 'it was not only the indignity of having my best ornament taken from me; though that was bad; but it was this - how could I ever brush flies off my sides and my hind legs any more", "topic": "Evaluate the extent to which \"Black Beauty\" functions as a social commentary on 19th-century British society, specifically concerning animal welfare and class distinctions.", "question": "To what degree does Sewell's narrative strategy of anthropomorphizing Black Beauty and employing didactic dialogues effectively amplify the novel's critique of 19th-century British societal attitudes toward animal welfare and class-based disparities in treatment?", "choices": {"A": "It significantly diminishes the critique by prioritizing sentimental appeal over substantive social analysis.", "B": "It moderately enhances the critique by allowing for a relatable portrayal of animal suffering, but limits the exploration of broader systemic issues.", "C": "It substantially strengthens the critique by facilitating empathetic engagement and subtly exposing the hypocrisy of social hierarchies through the lens of animal exploitation.", "D": "It has no discernible impact on the critique as the novel\u2019s social commentary is primarily conveyed through factual descriptions of abusive practices."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Sewell's choice to tell the story from a horse\u2019s perspective, combined with the mother's teachings and interactions with various characters, allows for a powerful and subtle critique of social hierarchies and the exploitation of animals.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Jelly Jam Making Tips Recipe | Just A Pinch RecipesJelly  Jam Making Tips Recipe | Just A Pinch Recipes [PAR] Step-By-Step [PAR] 1\u00a0Jelly is a mixture of fruit juice and sugar that is clear and firm enough to hold its shape. [PAR] 2Jam is made from crushed or chopped fruit. Jam holds its shape, but is less firm than jelly. [PAR] 3If you plan on making jams and jellies, or doing any canning at home you will need a good guide to help you along the way. I have used many recipes found on the recipe guide in the pectin container and Kerr canning pamphlet with great success. [PAR] 4The success of all jellies and jams depends on the balance of sugar, acid and pectin. [PAR] 5Pectin is what makes jam happen. It's a natural thickening substance found in many fruits like strawberries and apples, etc. Usually fruits that are slightly under ripe are highest in pectin. This is why many older recipes (ones that you don't add powdered or liquid commercial pectin) call for ripe fruit and under ripe fruit. Other fruits, like cherries and blueberries, contain little natural pectin. They must be mixed with other fruits high in pectin or with commercial pectin products for a gel to form. [PAR] 6The right amount of acid is critical to gel formation. With too little acid, the gel will never set. Too much acid will cause the gel to lose liquid (weep).  If fruits are low in acid, add lemon juice or other acid ingredients as directed. Commercial pectin products contain enough acid to ensure gelling. [PAR] 7Use granulated or preserving sugar. Granulated is fine for high-pectin fruits. Preserving sugar is more expensive but will help set low-pectin fruits without the need to add lemon juice. Always make sure the sugar is completely dissolved before bringing to a boil. If not, the result will be grainy. [PAR] 8Always use undamaged fruit. Fruit with too much damage will spoil the result and the jam is likely to deteriorate quickly. [PAR] 9Don\u2019t make too large a quantity at one time. Large volumes of fruit and sugar will take a long time to reach setting point causing the fruit to beak up and eventually dissolve in the jam. Generally it is suggested to use 1 to 2 cups of sugar for 2 cups of prepared fruit or fruit juice. The amount varies to the degree of set you want and to type of product - jellies, jam, preserves, conserves etc. you are making. [PAR] 10The amount of acid to add depends on the amount in the fruit you are using so check the sheet. Acidity is easily boosted by adding lemon juice to the fruit before cooking \u2013 about 2 tablespoons to 2 cups of prepared fruit or fruit juice. To determine the amount of pectin in your liquid put one teaspoon of the liquid on a plate and add 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol to the mix. Swirl the mixture around until clots start to form. It will amaze you but it will happen and you will know the strength of the pectin by the size of the clots. Basically you want a fairly large viscous clot to form to indicate strong pectin. Weak pectin count will show up as several small, scattered clumps. If that is the case, just bring the liquid back to the boil and reduce further. If you put a teaspoon of butter in cold juice before you boil jelly you will not have a scum on the jelly. [PAR] 11A vegetable brush is just the thing to remove scum from jelly.\u00a0 Jellies made from frozen berries are superior to those made from fresh fruit. [PAR] 12The freezing and thawing break down the cells of the fruit and allow the natural colors to dissolve in the juice. To economize on sugar when making jam, let the fruit boil for about 10 minutes before adding sugar. Only about 1/2 of the usual amount of sugar will be needed. [PAR] 13Temperature test \u2014 Use a jelly or candy thermometer, and boil until mixture reaches the following  temperatures at altitudes of: [PAR] 14Sea level to 1,000 feet \u2014 220 degrees F **** 1,001 feet to 2,000 feet \u2014 218 degrees F [PAR] 15When the gelling point", "topic": "Explain how the text describes the process of determining the pectin level in fruit juice using rubbing alcohol and what the resulting clot formations indicate.", "question": "According to the text, what does the size and consistency of the clot formations observed when a teaspoon of fruit juice is mixed with rubbing alcohol indicate regarding the pectin level in the juice?", "choices": {"A": "Large, viscous clots indicate a weak pectin count, requiring further reduction.", "B": "Several small, scattered clumps indicate a strong pectin count, suitable for gel formation.", "C": "A fairly large, viscous clot indicates a strong pectin count, suggesting adequate pectin for gel formation.", "D": "The size of the clot is irrelevant; the consistency of the alcohol mixture is the sole indicator of pectin strength."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \"Basically you want a fairly large viscous clot to form to indicate strong pectin.

B.\u00a0Priestley [PAR] Posted by interestingliterature [PAR] Interesting trivia about the life of writer J. B. Priestley, author of\u00a0An Inspector Calls [PAR] 1. John Boynton Priestley (1894-1984) wrote the first play ever to be televised.\u00a0Although he\u2019s better known for An Inspector Calls [PAR] , several of Priestley\u2019s other plays are notable.\u00a0Priestley\u2019s romantic comedy\u00a0When We Are Married was the first play to be televised unedited from a theatre, on 16 November 1938. (On the subject of romance, Priestley himself was something of a ladies\u2019 man, despite having what one acquaintance described as a \u2018 potato face \u2018 \u2013 see the excellent David Low caricature of Priestley below for more on this.)\u00a0An Inspector Calls\u00a0(1945) is, however, his most popular play, centring on the titular inspector\u2019s visit to the home of the wealthy middle-class Birling family. In the course of his interview with the family, Inspector Goole discovers that every member of the family played a part in the tragic suicide of a local working-class woman named Eva Smith. [PAR] 2. Priestley\u2019s wartime broadcasts were hugely important. His Sunday night\u00a0Postscripts broadcasts for BBC radio during the Second World War had a huge audience of some 16 million listeners, making him arguably the second most important wartime broadcaster in Britain after Winston Churchill. However, his broadcasts came to an end in 1941; for a long time the precise reason for their cancellation remained a mystery. It is often claimed (including, we confess, by us here at\u00a0Interesting Literature, until Nicolas Hawkes of the J. B. Priestley Society alerted [PAR] us to our error)\u00a0that it was Churchill who dropped Priestley from the schedules, but in fact, Hawkes informs us, the agent of the shortening (not sacking) of Priestley\u2019s series of 8-12 broadcasts in 1941 was the Minister of Information, Duff Cooper, who was being badgered by a rather unpleasant group of right-wing Tories. [PAR] If any reader would like to know the details they can go to the website of the JB Priestley Society , and contact the Society for Hawkes\u2019 46-page book The Story of JB Priestley\u2019s Postscripts (2008).

Priestley\u2019s \u2018Time Plays\u2019 \u2013 which are usually understood to comprise\u00a0Dangerous Corner (1932),\u00a0Time and the Conways (1937), I Have Been Here Before\u00a0(1937),\u00a0and\u00a0Johnson Over Jordan\u00a0(1939),\u00a0but also sometimes include that milestone in televised plays,\u00a0When We Are Married \u2013 are notable for their experimental treatment of the nature of time. Johnson Over Jordan\u00a0is like a Yorkshire version of\u00a0It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, as others have pointed out : after his death, the ordinary businessman Robert Johnson has to review his life before he can earn peace and be released from the spiritual limbo in which he is trapped. Each of the \u2018Time Plays\u2019 experiments with a different theory about time, many of them influenced by the work of philosopher J. W. Dunne (who would also inspire C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien to write short works of fiction influenced by his ideas).\u00a0Dangerous Corner, which was adapted for film in 1934, centres on a chance remark made by a guest about a cigarette-box at a dinner party, which sets in motion a chain of revelations. At the end of the play, however, time spools back to the start of the evening, the guest doesn\u2019t make his ill-advised remark, and none of the revelations comes to light.\u00a0Sliding Doors for the 1930s, perhaps.\u00a0Dangerous Corner was revived for the London stage in 2014 .

Of course many great guitarists may not have made this top 10 list, but feel free to add your own favorites in the comments. [PAR] 10. Tom Morello [PAR] The guitar player who makes his guitar sound anything but a guitar. Helicopter rudders, disc scratching, and his use of the kill switch for staccato like guitar riffs has made him probably the most innovative guitar player of our time. He is a guitarist who can take feedback, and ground hum from his own body into coherent music. Be it Rage Against The Machine , or Audioslave you can always see Morello\u2019s signature licks shining through. [PAR] 9. John Mayer [PAR] Whoa whoa wait, what? This pop artist? A guitar player? If all you\u2019ve ever heard from Mayer is Your Body Is Wonderland, or Daughters, then you\u2019ve got to give his album Continuum a listen to. He is no Shakespeare , but his guitar playing speaks to your soul. His songs will make most glorified tough guys miss their old girlfriend, and the rest just go to a corner and cry. If you think that his songs are all too depressing, then watch some videos of him playing. His guitar face is priceless. [PAR] 8. Jack White [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Mr. White is an incredibly underrated guitarist. His singles (From the White Stripes) always span with just three to four chords and his simplistic blues rhythm and picking styles have him overlooked most of the time. However, his masterful use of the Digitech Whammy and is erratic playing make for some of the most memorable guitar solos ever. Check out Ball and a Biscuit and try not to like that solo. One of my favorite Jack White moments was during the 2004 Grammys , where he took 7 Nation Army and went into a cover of Son House\u2019s Death Letter (another artist who I had to unwillingly cut out of the list). In an awards show celebrating Justin Timberlake and Missy Eliot, Jack White took time to give a salute to where things got started, to an artist born a century ago. [PAR] 7. Jimmy Page [PAR] Admit it. You\u2019ve slow danced to Stairway To\u00a0Heaven before.

He may have to sit down when he plays, but he\u2019ll have you on your feet when he does. BB\u2019s creamy yet piercing tone, his unique vibrato and his absolute flawless ability to express his emotions through the guitar earn him a spot in the top ten.

[PAR] The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the former amusement park, which includes Jackson\u2019s 12,000 square-foot home and 2,700 acres, will go to the highest bidder. Jackson purchased the property in 1987 for $19.5 million, but defaulted on a $24.5 million loan in 2008.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Nightmare Before ChristmasThe Nightmare Before Christmas, often promoted as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, is a 1993 American stop motion dark fantasy musical film directed by Henry Selick, and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, a character from \"Halloween Town\" who stumbles through a portal to \"Christmas Town\" and decides to celebrate the holiday, with some dastardly and comical consequences. Danny Elfman wrote the film score and voiced the singing role of Jack. The principal voice cast also includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens and Glenn Shadix. [PAR] The Nightmare Before Christmas originated in a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Walt Disney Studios began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, he made a development deal with Disney. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco. Disney released the film through the Touchstone Pictures banner because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark, and scary for kids.\" [PAR] The Nightmare Before Christmas was met with both critical and financial success. The film has since been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and re-released annually in the Disney Digital 3-D format from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3D. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The story starts in a forest called Holiday Woods with seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays: Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Halloween and Independence Day. Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington, a skeleton known as The Pumpkin King, leads them in organizing the annual Halloween holiday (\"This is Halloween\"). However, in a monologue, Jack reveals he has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and wants something more (\"Jack's Lament\"). Wandering dejectedly in the woods, he stumbles across the seven holiday doors and accidentally opens a portal to Christmas Town, whose residents are charged with organizing the annual Christmas holiday (\"What's This?\"). Impressed by the bright and cheery feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of Christmas, to the Halloween Town residents. However, they fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween, although there is one Christmas character they can relate to: the fearsome lobster-like king of Christmas Town who flies at night, named \"Sandy Claws\" (\"Town Meeting Song\"). Jack is dismayed that no one understands the feeling of Christmas, obsessively tries to study the holiday but fails to grasp any further explanation of it. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the feeling and there's no reason why he shouldn't be able to, and announces that the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year (\"Jack's Obsession\"). [PAR] Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of Santa. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman created by the town's mad scientist, starts falling in love with Jack (\"Making Christmas\"). However, after a vision of a burning Christmas tree, she alone realizes that his plans to run Christmas will become disastrous, but has no luck convincing him. Jack assigns Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town (\"Kidnap The Sandy Claws\"). Against Jack's wishes and largely for their amusement, the trio deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake (\"Oogie Boogie's Song\").

Five years later, shuttle flights began when Columbia traveled into space on a 54-hour mission. Launched by two solid-rocket boosters and an external tank, the aircraft-like shuttle entered into orbit around Earth. When the mission was completed, the shuttle fired engines to reduce speed and, after descending through the atmosphere, landed like a glider. Early shuttles took satellite equipment into space and carried out various scientific experiments. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] After \"Teacher in Space\" Christa McAuliffe was killed during the 1986 Challenger disaster, her backup, a former math teacher named Barbara Morgan, served as a mission specialist during a 2007 flight of the shuttle Endeavor. [PAR] Challenger, NASA\u2019s second space shuttle to enter service, embarked on its maiden voyage on April 4, 1983, and made a total of nine voyages prior to 1986. That year, it was scheduled to launch on January 22 carrying a seven-member crew that included Christa McAuliffe, a 37-year-old high school social studies instructor from New Hampshire who had earned a spot on the mission through NASA\u2019s Teacher in Space Program. After undergoing months of training, she was set to become the first ordinary American citizen to travel into space. [PAR] Challenger\u2019s Catastrophic Launch [PAR] The mission\u2019s launch from Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida , was delayed for six days due to weather and technical problems. The morning of January 28 was unusually cold, and engineers warned their superiors that certain components\u2014particularly the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the shuttle\u2019s solid rocket boosters\u2014were vulnerable to failure at low temperatures. However, these warnings went unheeded, and at 11:39 a.m. Challenger lifted off. [PAR] Seventy-three seconds later, hundreds on the ground, including the families of McAuliffe and the other astronauts on board, stared in disbelief as the shuttle broke up in a forking plume of smoke and fire. Millions more watched the wrenching tragedy unfold on live television. Within instants, the spacecraft broke apart and plunged into the ocean, killing its entire crew, traumatizing the nation and throwing NASA\u2019s shuttle program into turmoil. [PAR] Investigation by the Rogers Commission [PAR] Shortly after the disaster, President Ronald Reagan appointed a special commission to determine what went wrong with Challenger and to develop future corrective measures. Headed by former secretary of state William Rogers, the commission included former astronaut Neil Armstrong and former test pilot Chuck Yeager. Their investigation revealed that the O-ring seal on Challenger\u2019s solid rocket booster, which had become brittle in the cold temperatures, failed. Flames then broke out of the booster and damaged the external fuel tank, causing the spacecraft to disintegrate. [PAR] The commission also found that Morton Thiokol, the company that designed the solid rocket boosters, had ignored warnings about potential issues. NASA managers were aware of these design problems but also failed to take action. Famously, scientist Richard Feynman, a member of the commission, demonstrated the O-ring flaw to the public using a simple glass of ice water. [PAR] Aftermath of the Challenger Disaster [PAR] After the accident, NASA refrained from sending astronauts into space for more than two years as it redesigned a number of the shuttle\u2019s features. Flights began again in September 1988 with the successful launching of Discovery. Since then, the space shuttle has carried out numerous important missions, including the repair and maintenance of the Hubble Space Telescope and the construction of the International Space Station. On February 1, 2003, a second space shuttle disaster rocked the United States when Columbia disintegrated upon reentry, killing all aboard. While missions resumed in July 2005, the space shuttle is slated for retirement in 2011. [PAR] Ten years after the Challenger tragedy, two large pieces from the spacecraft washed ashore on a Florida beach. The remaining debris is now stored in a missile silo at Cape Canaveral.

[PAR] Looking around at other recipes I\u2019ve noticed that many people make croutons in the oven. I\u2019ve done that (and still do on occasion); but you do have to be careful if you cook them that way.

If the bread isn't just a little dry, spread the cubes out on a baking sheet and put them in a warm oven (200\u00b0F or 90\u00b0C) for about 10 minutes. You don't want them to be all dried out, just a little dry on the surface so that they brown better, and they hold up better when tossed in a salad or baked in a stuffing. [PAR] 3 Melt butter on medium high heat in a large saut\u00e9 pan. Add the croutons and mix them up in the butter so they get lightly coated. Spread the croutons out in a single layer in the pan. [PAR] Then don't stir them until they start to brown on one side. Once they start to brown, use a metal spatula to lift them up and turn them over, so more sides brown. When the croutons are at least a little toasted on a couple of sides, remove from heat. [PAR] If storing, let cool completely before putting in an airtight container.

They offer the most ranking points,  prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and greater number of \"best of\" sets for men. The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January, the French Open in May and June, Wimbledon in June and July, and the US Open in August and September. Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks. The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass. Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905. However, of these four, only Wimbledon was a major before 1924/25, the time when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments. [PAR] The term Grand Slam also, and originally, refers to the achievement of winning all four major championships in a single calendar year within one of the five events: men's and women's singles; men's, women's, and mixed doubles. In doubles, one team may accomplish a Grand Slam playing together or one player may achieve it with different partners. The term \"Grand Slam\" without qualification refers to winning the four majors in a single calendar year.    [PAR] Winning the four majors in consecutive tournaments but not in the same year is known as a Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam, while winning all four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam. Winning the gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games in addition to the four majors in a one calendar year is known as a \"Golden Grand Slam\" or more commonly the \"Golden Slam\". Also, winning the Year-End Championship (known as ATP World Tour Finals for men's singles and doubles disciplines, and WTA Tour Championships for both women's disciplines) in the same period is known as a \"Super Slam\". Together, all four Majors in all three disciplines (singles, doubles, and mixed doubles) are called a \"boxed set\" of Grand Slam titles. No male or female player has won all twelve events in one calendar year, although a \"career boxed set\" has been achieved by three female players. [PAR] Origin of the term \"Grand Slam\" [PAR] The term slam for winning all of the tricks in the whist family card games (see also whist terms) is attested from early in the 17th century. Grand slam for all of the tricks, in contrast to small slam or little slam for all but one, dates from early in the 19th century.  This use was inherited by contract bridge, a modern development of whist defined in 1925 that became very popular in Britain and America by 1930. [PAR] Grand slam has been used in golf since 1930, when Bobby Jones won the four major championships, two British and two American. Although John F. Kieran is widely credited with first applying the term \"grand slam\" to tennis, to describe the winning of all four major tennis tournaments in a calendar year, sports columnist Alan Gould had used the term in that connection almost two months before Kieran.  [PAR] History [PAR] The possibility of being the reigning champion of all the current four Majors did not exist until 1924/25, when the International Lawn Tennis Federation designated the Australasian, French (before 1925 only open to members of French tennis clubs), British and American championship tournaments as the four Majors. Before that time only three events: Wimbledon, the World Hard Court Championships (held in Paris & once in Brussels) and the World Covered Court Championships (held in various locations) were considered the premier international tennis events by the ILTF.

See the Cast Then and Now [PAR] Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the latest in a long line of actors to tackle the role of Count Dracula; over 20 actors have played the iconic vampire on screen since Bram Stoker penned his classic horror novel in 1897. [PAR] In NBC\u2019s new series Dracula, premiering Oct. 25, Rhys said he definitely portrays Dracula as \u201ca monster\u201d\u2014with one twist. \u201cThe thing that makes the Dracula story interesting is he\u2019s 99 percent monster and 1 percent human,\u201d Meyers told Parade . \u201cIt\u2019s the 1 percent that causes all the problems. This little bit of humanity is what causes the conflict. If he was all monster, there would be bliss.\u201d [PAR] To gear up for the premiere of NBC\u2019s Dracula, we\u2019re taking a look back at the top five onscreen Draculas of all time, from the grandfather of all silver screen Draculas, Bela Lugosi, to more modern interpretations from Frank Langella, Gary Oldman, and more. [PAR] Bela Lugosi, Dracula (1931) [PAR] Hungarian-American actor Bela Lugosi set the standard for silver screen portrayals of Count Dracula. He first appeared as Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of Bram Stoker\u2019s book and four years later, he was cast as the Count in the 1931 Universal Pictures classic. His restrained, chilly portrayal of the vampire made him the definitive Count Dracula. [PAR] Christopher Lee, Hammer Films (1958-1973) [PAR] The British actor played Dracula in a long list of movies throughout the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s, including 1958\u2019s Dracula, 1965\u2019s Dracula: Prince of Darkness, and 1970\u2019s Scars of Dracula. Though his Dracula films were mostly huge commercial hits, Lee has said publicly that he was \u201cblackmailed\u201d into playing Dracula by Hammer Films, which apparently got him to stay by reminding him how many people would lose their jobs if he quit. [PAR] Frank Langella, Dracula: A Love Story (1979) [PAR] Frank Langella starred alongside Laurence Olivier in this 1979 adaptation of Bram Stoker\u2019s classic novel. Unlike other classic Draculas, he never wore fangs and never appeared with a bloody face; his Dracula is charming, suave, and sophisticated (but still deadly). [PAR] Klaus Kinski, Nosferatu the Vampyre \u00a0(1979) [PAR] German actor Klaus Kinski played Count Dracula in this understatedly creepy interpretation of the classic story, directed by Warner Herzog. Set in 19th-century Germany and Transylvania, the film is a remake of 1922\u2019s Nosferatu. Kinski\u2019s pale makeup, sharpened teeth, and long fingernails are a nod to the Max Schreck\u2018s Count Orlok\u00a0in the 1922 original. [PAR] Gary Oldman, Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula (1992) [PAR] Alongside Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and Keanu Reeves, Oldman played a vicious yet seductive Dracula in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s dreamlike adaptation of the classic tale, which Time critic Richard Corliss called a \u201cluscious, infernal romance.\u201d\u00a0 [PAR] Who\u2019s your favorite onscreen Dracula of all time?

During his tenure as chairman of Glyndebourne Productions, Christie established (1968) the Glyndebourne Touring Opera, oversaw the expansion of the production repertoire to include modern works, and commissioned the construction (1992\u201394) of an acclaimed 1,200-seat opera house to replace the aging 300-seat theatre (later expanded to 850 seats) that his father had established as Britain\u2019s first purpose-built opera house. Christie was born just seven months after his pregnant mother, soprano Audrey Mildmay, sang the role of Susanna in Mozart\u2019s Le nozze de Figaro in the festival\u2019s inaugural performance on May 28, 1934. He followed his father\u2019s educational path to Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, but left the university without graduating. He took charge of the family-run festival at the age of 23 when ill health prevented his father from continuing (his father died in 1962). Christie devoted his life to private fund-raising to support the festival, the touring company, and the new theatre. At the end of 1999 he handed over his position of executive chairman to his second son, Gus. Christie was knighted in 1984, and in 2002 he was made a Companion of Honour (an order to which his father had been appointed in 1954).[DOC] [TLE] Glyndebourne : a history of the Festival Opera founded in ...Glyndebourne : a history of the Festival Opera founded in 1934 by Audrey and John Christie (Book, 1981) [WorldCat.org] [PAR] The E-mail message field is required.

[PAR] Published on Dec 2, 2013 [PAR] \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" is a 1967 song by the Bee Gees, written by Barry and Robin Gibb. Barring a moderately successful reissue of their Australian single \"Spicks and Specks\", it was the first single release of the group's international career and their first song to hit the charts in the US or UK.  The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album Bee Gees' 1st. The first single with Australian drummer Colin Petersen as an official member of the band. [PAR] Category[DOC] [TLE] New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Have You Seen My Wife, Mr ...New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones) by Bee Gees Songfacts [PAR] Songfacts [PAR] This Beatles-inspired song was the first single The Bee Gees recorded in England. It became their first international success. [PAR] This song is about a miner trapped beneath the surface who wants to contact his wife. There was no such event, and the lyrics are totally fictional. >> [PAR] Suggestion credit: [PAR] Edward Pearce - Ashford, Kent, England, for above 2 [PAR] The Gibb brothers wrote the song when they were sitting in the dark on some studio stairs at Polydor Records imagining they were stuck in a mine accident. They placed it in New York; far from Wales where a recent accident had taken place so as not to offend those who were hurt by it. [PAR] The second verse has one line less than the first verse, which is an example of The Bee Gees intricate songcraft in their early years. >> [PAR] Suggestion credit: [PAR] Ben Dirks - Nijmegen, Netherlands, for above 2 [PAR] There was no mining disaster in New York in 1941, although there was one in McIntire, Pennsylvania which killed 6 people. The song though appears to have been vaguely inspired by the Aberfan tragedy in South Wales. On October 21, 1966, 144 people were killed, 116 of them children, when a waste tip slid down a mountainside; unsurprisingly the story generated massive media coverage, and even 40 years on the name Aberfan is synonymous with the tragedy. [PAR] In the biography The Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb, Maurice Gibb is quoted as saying the song is \"A total rip-off of the Beatles\" although later he is said to have retracted this. [PAR] The Barclay James Harvest song The Great 1974 Mining Disaster is based on this Bee Gees song. >> [PAR] Suggestion credit: [PAR] Alexander Baron - London, England, for above 3 [PAR] This song was covered by Chumbawamba on their 2000 album WYSIWYG. [PAR] Gibb recalled to The Mail On Sunday November 1, 2009: \"We recorded this at London's IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. The result was a very lonely sound.\" [PAR] Maurice Gibb recalled in a June 2001 interview with Mojo magazine: \"The opening chord doesn't sound like a conventional A minor. Barry was using the open D tuning he'd been taught when he was nine, and I was playing it in conventional tuning. It gives an unusual blend.

[PAR] History [PAR] The oldest known reference to the name is in a document of 1417, written by an English scholar in Latin, which refers to  and  (\"The Keys of Mann\" and \"The Keys of Law\"). There is a dispute, however, over the origin of the name. The word \"keys\" is thought by some to be an English corruption of a form of the Norse verb kj\u00f3sa meaning \"to choose\". However a more likely explanation is that it is a mishearing of the Manx-language term for \"four and twenty\",  (pronounced kee-air...), the House having always had 24 members. The Manx-language name of the House of Keys remains  (\"The Four and Twenty\"). [PAR] Governance [PAR] Members are known as Members of the House of Keys, (MHKs). Citizens over the age of 16 may vote, while one must be at least 18 years old and a resident of the Island for three years to be elected. There are 15 constituencies, based on the sheadings and other local government units. There are currently two 3-member constituencies, five 2-member constituencies and eight 1-member constituencies. The term of the House of Keys is normally fixed at five years, but provisions exist for dissolution before the expiration of the term. [PAR] The Speaker of the House of Keys (SHK) is an MHK chosen to be the presiding officer. He/she may vote in the same manner as other members, but he/she may also abstain, unlike the others; however, if the vote is tied the Speaker may not abstain and must cast the deciding vote. Unusually for a legislative body attendance is required by law and if a member cannot attend they must request permission for absence. [PAR] The House of Keys elects most of the members of the Legislative Council. Legislation does not usually originate in the Council. Thus, the Keys have much more power than the Council, which performs the function of a revising chamber. [PAR] The House of Keys meets about once each month with the Legislative Council in a joint session called Tynwald Court. The President of Tynwald, elected by both branches, presides over Tynwald Court and over the Legislative Council.

[PAR] Battery acid could refer to any acid used in a chemical cell or battery, but usually this term s applied to describe the acid used in a lead-acid battery, such as is found in a motor vehicle. [PAR] Answer: Car or automotive battery acid is 30-50% sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in water. Usually the acid has a mole fraction of 29%-32% sulfuric acid, density of 1.25\u20131.28 kg/L and concentration of 4.2\u20135 mol/L. Battery acid has a pH of approximately 0.8. [PAR] Lead-Acid Battery Construction and Chemical Reaction [PAR] A lead-acid battery consists of two lead plats separated by a liquid or gel containing sulfuric acid in water. The battery is rechargeable, with charging and\u00a0discharge chemical reactions. When the battery is being used (discharged), electrons move from the negatively-charged lead plate to the positively-charged plate. [PAR] The negative plate reaction is: [PAR] Pb(s) + HSO4-(aq) \u2192 PbSO4(s) + H+(aq) + 2 e- [PAR] The positive plate reaction is: [PAR] PbO2(s) + HSO4- + 3H+(aq) + 2 e- \u2192 PbSO4(s) + 2 H2O(l) [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance [PAR] Which may be combined to write the overall chemical reaction: [PAR] Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2 H2SO4(aq) \u2192 2 PbSO4(s) + 2 H2O(l) [PAR] When the battery is fully charged, the negative plate is lead, the electrolyte is concentrated sulfuric acid, and the positive plate is lead dioxide. If the battery is overcharged, electrolysis of water produces hydrogen gas and oxygen gas, which are lost. Some types of batteries allow water to be added to make up for the loss. [PAR] When the battery is discharged, the reverse reaction forms lead sulfate on both plates. If the battery is fully discharged, the result is two identical lead sulfate plates, separated by water. At this point, the battery is considered completely dead and can't recover to be charged again.[DOC] [TLE] What is a Car Battery? (with pictures) - wiseGEEKWhat is a Car Battery?

A separate page lists the Presidents of the Royal Academy . [PAR] The first academy of painting and drawing from life in Britain was set up in 1711 by Kneller, a leading painter of the time of Queen Anne. Kneller himself was governor of the academy, based in Great Queen Street, London, until 1716, at which time Thornhill, his great rival, took over the body. In 1720 arguments within the academy lead to Thornhill splitting off to start a new school in Covent Garden, and his son in law, William Hogarth ,  took the remaining members of the academy to a new site in St Martin's Lane. It was this academy, under Hogarth, that thrived, and formulated the plan for a British academy for all the arts. [PAR] The Dilettanti Society, founded in 1734 from a group of wealthy art amateurs, also became interested in the concept of a British academy, and in 1755 they held discussions with Hogarth's St Martin's Lane Academy in an effort to set up such an institution. However, the Dilettanti Society felt the best way would be for themselves to be in charge of the proposed institution, and to choose the President, and the St Martin's Academy could not agree to this. [PAR] Another new body, the Society of Artists - set up to exhibit its members pictures - by the early 1760s had attracted membership of many prominent artists - Hogarth himself, and the two great portrait painters of the time, Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds . In 1765 the Society of Artists were given a Royal Charter, and by this time all the well-known artists working in Britain had become members, and the Society had a good income from entrance fees to its exhibitions. All that was needed was a school for students, and this could become the long-demanded British academy of the arts. [PAR] Unfortunately, there was great rivalry within the society, with quarrels over who got the most advantageous placings for their pictures at the exhibitions, and over tickets to private views. Worst was a fight for the presidency of the Society - both Reynolds and Gainsborough distanced themselves from the unseemly proceedings, and two architects, Sir William Chambers and James Paine, vied for the control. Paine won, eventually becoming President in 1770. Chambers vowed revenge, and decided to form a new artistic body, of such importance that it would become pre-eminent over all others. As former architectural tutor to the King, Chambers had the best connections, and his formal proposal for a Royal  Academy was accepted by the King in 1768. In 1769 the Royal Academy came into existence.

Associates (ARA) to the number of 20 were also elected, and it became the rule that new Academicians were elected from existing ARAs. The officers of the Academy included a President (PRA), a Council of eight members, a Secretary, Librarian, Keeper and others. Professors in painting, architecture, perspective and anatomy were appointed, soon joined by Professors in Sculpture, Chemistry and others, to support the educational activities of the Academy. The Academy Schools were set up, to teach without charge to students, and included drawing from life, later painting from old masters, and painting from life. Students could win travelling scholarships to pursue their studies abroad. The Academy also gave to artists in need. [PAR] Where was the money to come from? The King provided initial funding for the Academy to set up in Pall Mall, but the bulk of the money, allowing the Academy to be financially independent, were the fees from exhibitions.

Pawlowski, CNN [PAR] Ryanair, a budget airline based in Ireland, is known for its rock-bottom fares and multitude of fees.

[PAR] (CNN) -- Fresh on the heels of one budget airline announcing that it will ask passengers to pay extra to bring carry-on bags on board, another is considering charging them for using the lavatory. [PAR] Ryanair, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, and bills itself as \"Europe's first and largest low fares airline,\" is mulling a plan that would require travelers to pay either 1 euro or 1 British pound (about $1.33 or $1.52) for using the bathroom on flights lasting one hour or less. [PAR] The plan, titled \"Ryanair Cost Saving Proposal,\" was published in the airline's inflight magazine. [PAR] The carrier said it is working with Boeing to develop a coin-operated door release so that when nature calls, passengers would need to deposit the change before being able to use the facilities. [PAR] The idea is to encourage people to use restrooms in airport terminals before boarding, Ryanair said. If the airline were to proceed, the changes would be at least 12 to 18 months away. [PAR] As part of the plan, the airline is also considering removing two of the three lavatories on some of its planes so it could squeeze in up to six extra seats. The move would help reduce fares by at least 5 percent, Ryanair said. [PAR] It's not the first time the airline has broached the subject of a toilet fee. CEO Michael O'Leary told the BBC in February 2009 that he was considering the charge. [PAR] How would it fly with passengers? One hint of how Americans might feel about it may come from an informal poll posted on TripAdvisor.com last summer in which one-fifth of the respondents said they would fly on an airline that charged a fee to access the bathroom; 78 percent said they would not. About 5,300 people answered the online survey question. But the idea may be less shocking to travelers in Europe, where it's not unusual to pay a small fee to use a public restroom. [PAR] Meanwhile, Ryanair announced Tuesday that it's raising its checked luggage fee from 15 euros to 20 euros per bag for the peak vacation months of July and August. [PAR] \"Ryanair is determined to incentivise passengers to travel light this summer,\" spokesman Stephen McNamara said in a statement. The airline urged its passengers to avoid the fees by bringing carry-on bags only. [PAR] Ryanair is already well-known for its fees and is up-front about them on its Web site, which details charges for everything from online check-in to traveling with infants. Customers haven't balked; in fact, Ryanair's passenger traffic grew 13 percent last month compared to the same time last year, the airline reported. [PAR] Low-cost carriers have embraced the concept of a la carte pricing, or keeping base fares at rock bottom levels while charging passengers for any extra services.

This rash of gang violence reached its bloody climax in a garage on the city\u2019s North Side on February 14, 1929, when seven men associated with the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, one of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, were shot to death by several men dressed as policemen. The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time. No one was ever brought to trial for the murders. [PAR] The Downfall of Public Enemy No. 1 [PAR] Though the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre marked the end of any significant gang opposition to Capone\u2019s rule in Chicago, it can also be said to have marked the beginning of his downfall.
