Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT). By utilizing the resources of a nation (often including its\n\nintelligence and military resources) APTs are a severe threat.\n\n:::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.5.

Tools of the Trade {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tools_of_the_trade}\nWith all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the question remains, \\\"What can be done?\\\" There\n\nare a few tools the security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture including: *user\n\nawareness*, *anti-malware software*, *backups*, and *encryption*.\n\n::: description-list\n\n[User Awareness]{.term}\n\n:   [A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform\n\n    other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure. While a backup does not solve the problem of the data being\n\n    sold or used by others, it does allow for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a security\n\n    plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Encryption]{.term}\n\n:   [At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to make it useful. Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key. Often,\n\n    encryption and backups complement each other and fill in the use cases that each lacks individually.

{"context": "### 2.10.5. Digital Certificates {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__digital_certificates}\nA digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company or an individual. Since asymmetric encryption\n\nrequires know a party's public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of the owner. The question\n\nthen becomes how do you trust that the public key is *actually* for the alleged owner? That's where the issuing\n\nauthority comes in. A *certificate authority (CA)* signs the certificate indicating that the ID and public_key are\n\ncorrect. Certificates can be self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often only used in\n\ntesting. Since most certificates are used for encrypting web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is\n\nusing a self-signed certificate.\n\nGiven how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not\n\nissues by root CAs, but are actually issued by intermediate CAs. Root CAs delegate the work to Intermediate CAs and\n\nindicate their trust in them by signing the intermediate CAs keys. This creates a *chain of trust* from the issued\n\ncertificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA (signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by\n\nthe browser). Tools that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and update them from the companies\n\nthat issue them as needed.\n\nThe certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact with it is often possible to install root CAs\n\nmanually. [This is can be used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for\n\ndebugging](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert){.link} or for more nefarious\n\npurposes.

{"context": "### 7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}\nThere are several different authorization models that can be used. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context.

A vulnerability would be an unlocked door. Vulnerability\n\nmanagement would be noticing the door and weighing the risk. This may involve looking at the crime rate of the area,\n\ndetermining the value of the items in the house, taking into account how difficult it would be to lock the door, and\n\ndetermining whether you want to lock the door and/or purchase an alarm system. An asset would be the things in the\n\nhouse, like a laptop of example. Risk would be the impact or a robbery, perhaps \\$800 for the lost laptop. Finally\n\ncontrols/countermeasures would be locking the door, getting a camera system, and/or and alarm system.\n\n:::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"8.1.

In casual conversation we may assume that\n\n    *authorization* is a foregone conclusion once an actor has progressed this far, but in actuality authorization\n\n    relies on the previous steps being completed and may in fact fail.

{"context": "### 7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}\nThere are several different authorization models that can be used. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

During the key exchange the attacker creates a custom certificate signed by a bogus CA for the\n\nconnection between attacker and victim. The attacker also makes an actual HTTPS connection to the service and proxies\n\ndata for the victim. All of the victims data will show up in plaintext for the attacker but the connection will appear\n\nto be secure for the victim. This is used in the [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler){.link} debugging proxy to\n\ndecrypt HTTPS traffic and is also used in some network appliances that perform deep packet inspection.\n\nAnother MitM attack on SSL is simply to maintain or downgrade to an HTTP connection with the victim and proxy data to an\n\nactual HTTPS connection with the server. Most servers will upgrade an insecure connection, but by intercepting that\n\nexchange the attacker can continue to monitor the victim's traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::::::::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"5.2.

This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range).

These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure. While a backup does not solve the problem of the data being\n\n    sold or used by others, it does allow for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a security\n\n    plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Encryption]{.term}\n\n:   [At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to make it useful. Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key.

The most popular container orchestration system is\n\n[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){.link}, developed by Google to manage web applications.\n\nGiven the orchestration systems create containers from images as needed, one of the obvious areas of concern is the\n\nintegrity of those images. If an image registry is compromised the orchestration system will still deploy the images\n\nstored there typically making the issue far worse. Containers can also be hard to manage from a logging standpoint,\n\nwhich may cause compliance issues. Whereas a company may have monitored the logs of a single server in the past, they\n\nnow have to monitor the logs of hundreds of containers running on a server.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"10.1.4.

{"context": "### 7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}\nThere are several different authorization models that can be used. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

Digital Certificates {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__digital_certificates}\nA digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company or an individual. Since asymmetric encryption\n\nrequires know a party's public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of the owner. The question\n\nthen becomes how do you trust that the public key is *actually* for the alleged owner? That's where the issuing\n\nauthority comes in. A *certificate authority (CA)* signs the certificate indicating that the ID and public_key are\n\ncorrect. Certificates can be self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often only used in\n\ntesting. Since most certificates are used for encrypting web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is\n\nusing a self-signed certificate.\n\nGiven how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not\n\nissues by root CAs, but are actually issued by intermediate CAs. Root CAs delegate the work to Intermediate CAs and\n\nindicate their trust in them by signing the intermediate CAs keys. This creates a *chain of trust* from the issued\n\ncertificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA (signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by\n\nthe browser). Tools that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and update them from the companies\n\nthat issue them as needed.\n\nThe certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact with it is often possible to install root CAs\n\nmanually. [This is can be used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for\n\ndebugging](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert){.link} or for more nefarious\n\npurposes.

Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself.

These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.
