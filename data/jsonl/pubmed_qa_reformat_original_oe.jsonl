One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%). Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival: patients with an asymptomatic recurrence had a median survival time from relapse of 35 months versus 13 months if they had a symptomatic repetition (P = 0.0001).\n\n", "question": "What role do different follow-up modalities, such as clinical visits and imaging techniques, play in the early detection of asymptomatic endometrial cancer recurrences, and how might this impact patient outcomes?", "answer": "Different follow-up modalities, such as clinical visits and imaging, are crucial for the early detection of asymptomatic endometrial cancer recurrences, potentially leading to better patient outcomes due to earlier intervention.", "explanation": "The study indicates that a significant proportion of patients (58.5%) were asymptomatic when recurrence was detected during planned visits or examinations.
