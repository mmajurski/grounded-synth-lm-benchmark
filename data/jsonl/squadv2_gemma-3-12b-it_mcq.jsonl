Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

{"context": "Although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts.[n 8] The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orl\u00e9ans, living in adjacent buildings.", "topic": "Discuss the role of Sand's estate at Nohant in Chopin's life and artistic development during their summers between 1839 and 1846.", "question": "What was the most significant consequence of Chopin's extended summer stays at Sand\u2019s estate in Nohant between 1839 and 1846?", "choices": {"A": "It fostered a period of intense artistic productivity, directly resulting in the composition of his most celebrated nocturnes.", "B": "It provided a respite from Parisian social obligations, allowing Chopin to prioritize his health and indirectly facilitating his musical output.", "C": "It led to a complete severing of ties with Parisian artistic circles, resulting in a more isolated and introspective compositional style.", "D": "It necessitated the frequent sale and repurchase of pianos to circumvent French customs regulations, significantly impacting Chopin\u2019s financial stability."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The passage explicitly states the detrimental effect of bad weather on Chopin's health, leading to the move to Nohant.
