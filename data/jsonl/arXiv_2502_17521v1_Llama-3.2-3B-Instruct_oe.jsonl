Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider.

However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.

{"context": "### 6 Conclusion\nThis survey reviews the literature on data contamination in LLM benchmarking, analyzing both static and dynamic approaches. We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n", "topic": "Importance of further refinement and validation of proposed criteria", "question": "What are the primary implications of the proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking being a first step, and how might further refinement and validation address the challenges and limitations discussed in the context?", "answer": "The primary implications of the proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking being a first step are that further refinement and validation are necessary to address the challenges and limitations discussed in the context, such as the need for standardized dynamic evaluation and practical mitigation tools.", "explanation": "The proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step that may need further refinement and validation to ensure their effectiveness and reliability in real-world applications.

{"context": "##### 4.2.4 Stable of Complexity\nDynamic benchmarks must also account for complexity to help users determine whether a performance drop in an LLM on the transformed dataset is due to potential data contamination or an increase in task complexity. If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications.
