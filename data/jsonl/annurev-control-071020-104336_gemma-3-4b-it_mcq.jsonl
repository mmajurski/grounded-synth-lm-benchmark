{"context": "## 2.1. Existing Robotic Prosthetic Hands\nNumerous commercially available RPH solutions use underactuated mechanisms ( Supplemental Table 1 ), including the Michelangelo prosthetic hand (Ottobock, Germany), the i-Limb Ultra (\u00d6ssur, Iceland), the bebionic hand (Ottobock), and the VINCENT evolution 3 (Vincent Systems, Germany). Despite remarkable advances, there is still arguably a trade-off between dexterity and weight in these solutions, with companies usually emphasizing one aspect or the other.\n\nMany research groups are currently working on innovative solutions to tackle the dexterity/ weight dilemma (19), such as the use of a monolithic 3D-printed soft material (20) or mechanical solutions to implement finger synergies via clutches (21). For example, Jing et al. (19) proposed an anthropomorphic RPH using only three motors that could achieve 13 grasp types while weighing only approximately 130 g.\n\nThe price of RPHs is an additional limiting factor for broader adoption by patients. With most advanced solutions costing $10,000-20,000, many researchers advocate for cheaper solutions, particularly for emerging countries (e.g., 22).\n\nOpen source RPHs are an exciting alternative to dramatically reduce the cost of development and distribution. One particularly interesting aspect of such hands is simplified maintenance and repairs (using, e.g., 3D printing) that do not rely on specific suppliers. For example, Open\n\nBionics (United Kingdom) commercializes solutions for transradial amputees (e.g., the medically certified Hero Arm) but also provides the source files for some of their designs, and e-NABLE ( https://enablingthefuture.org ) reports 8,000 recipients of their prosthetics, which were built by volunteers around the world. Open source RPHs also enable users to alter the design to meet their unique needs; for example, the Galileo Hand (23) allows easy customization of the types of movements and number of electromyography (EMG) electrodes.\n\nResearchers are also working on better mechanical solutions to improve RPH dexterity. An underactuated hand prosthesis designed by Abayasiri et al. (24) has finger abduction and adduction to enable it to grasp larger objects, and an adaptive prosthetic hand designed by Yong et al. (25) adds DOFs in the palm with movable metacarpals. The Karlsruhe Institute of T echnology (KIT) prosthetic hand (26) has an embedded camera and real-time object recognition, enabling the hand to be preshaped. Pneumatic artificial muscle (27) permits the development of light, compact solutions. Finally, biomimetic actuation is used for muscle-like actuators (15).\n\nIn addition to the hardware aspect, there are also innovations in RPH control and sensorization. Low-level controllers use information about the state of the device and eventually activate the actuation to meet the desired state imposed by the user's intentions. The choice of the state variable has a strong influence on how the device works. Position or speed can be read through encoders of each joint and controlled; these are straightforward approaches that have been used broadly in robotic applications. When the interaction of the hand with the external environment is of interest, more advanced control systems are implemented, such as torque or impedance control. Both approaches measure the force applied by the actuator, controlling it directly in the first case and simulating compliance in the second. Advanced control strategies enable complex manipulation and smoother gestures at the expense of a bulkier mechanical structure and a more complex control system. Therefore, enabling more sophisticated control requires integrated force and position sensors, which have been previously developed mainly to close the robotic control loop (28).\n\nIn summary, low-cost and light hands have flourished over the last few years. The race to simplify designs and reduce costs through 3D printing should not impact the dexterity of RPHs. For now, underactuated mechanisms are the best solution for RPHs and innovative designs based on synergy mechanisms or friction, the latter of which can help increase the number of DOAs without increasing the number of motors.\n", "topic": "The different mechanical solutions being explored to improve RPH dexterity, including underactuation, synergistic mechanisms, and pneumatic artificial muscles.", "question": "Considering the described approaches to RPH dexterity \u2013 including underactuation, synergistic mechanisms, and pneumatic artificial muscles \u2013 which mechanical solution inherently presents the most significant challenge in simultaneously achieving high dexterity and minimizing overall weight?", "choices": {"A": "Underactuated mechanisms, as they typically prioritize grasping variety over structural compactness.", "B": "Pneumatic artificial muscles, due to their reliance on external compressors and potential for bulkiness.", "C": "Synergistic mechanisms, which often require complex linkages and may introduce significant inertia.", "D": "Open-source designs, which prioritize accessibility and customization over optimized mechanical performance."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that many RPH solutions involve a trade-off between dexterity and weight.

Historically, humans have replaced a missing limb with a prosthesis for cosmetic, vocational, or personal autonomy reasons. The hand is a powerful tool, and its loss causes severe physical and often mental debilitation. Technological advancements have allowed the development of increasingly effective artificial hands, which can improve the quality of life of people who suffered a hand amputation. Here, we review the state of the art of robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs), with particular attention to the potential and current limits of their main building blocks: the hand itself, approaches to decoding voluntary commands and controlling the hand, and systems and methods for providing sensory feedback to the user. We also briefly describe existing approaches to characterizing the performance of subjects using RPHs for grasping tasks and provide perspectives on the future of different components and the overall field of RPH development.\n", "topic": "The historical motivations and impact of using prosthetic hands on quality of life.", "question": "Beyond purely functional necessity, what fundamental psychological and social factors historically drove the adoption of prosthetic hands, and how do these factors continue to shape the goals of contemporary RPH design?", "choices": {"A": "Primarily driven by the need for immediate economic productivity to replace lost wages.", "B": "Driven by a complex interplay of desire for social acceptance, restoration of self-image, and the pursuit of regained personal autonomy.", "C": "Largely determined by the availability of affordable materials and manufacturing techniques.", "D": "Primarily motivated by medical professionals seeking to alleviate physical pain."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The context emphasizes motivations beyond mere functionality, including cosmetic, vocational, and autonomy reasons.

{"context": "## 7. CONCLUSION\nMorethan20years ago,remarkable results by a group of French surgeons for hand transplantation (8) had raised hopes for a future where grafting would be the norm and prosthetics eventually obsolete (176). However, not only has this prediction-unfortunately-not yet come to pass, but also the adoption of new RPH technologies has been slower than expected. As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback. We have proposed here an outline of possible iterations of RPHs for the next few years and for 5-10 years in the future.\n\nIn our view, there could soon be a broader integration of simple somatosensory feedback using mature implantable techniques, such as cuff electrodes. Motor decoding using machine learning and shared-control algorithms could permit continuous command of single fingers and broader sets of grasps.

{"context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "The significance of sensorization and feedback systems in enhancing the acceptability and performance of RPHs.", "question": "Beyond simply providing data, how does incorporating tactile feedback into an RPH\u2019s sensorization strategy fundamentally alter the cognitive demands associated with complex manipulation tasks, as described in the text?", "choices": {"A": "Tactile feedback primarily enhances the precision of motor control, reducing the need for visual monitoring.", "B": "Tactile feedback shifts the cognitive burden from actively monitoring the object's position and shape to passively experiencing its properties, streamlining the manipulation process.", "C": "Tactile feedback primarily serves as a safety mechanism, preventing damage to the prosthetic hand and the manipulated object.", "D": "Tactile feedback has no significant impact on cognitive demands, as the primary challenge in RPH operation remains the mechanical dexterity of the device."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) aligns with the text\u2019s emphasis on feedback systems increasing acceptability and performance by allowing users to \u201cexperience the surrounding world and shape it.\u201d The other options misrepresent the role of tactile feedback as primarily focused on precision, safety, or lacking impact.", "question_token_count": 36, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 8, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 4, "avg_answer_token_count": 26}
{"context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n", "topic": "The role of innovative actuation systems like McKibben pneumatic muscles and granular jamming in the development of soft robotic devices.", "question": "Considering the developmental stage of McKibben pneumatic muscles and granular jamming as presented, what fundamental obstacle most significantly hinders their immediate deployment in portable robotic devices, as suggested by the text?", "choices": {"A": "The inherent lack of sensorization capabilities within these actuation methods.", "B": "The requirement for extensive integration before they can be utilized in portable devices.", "C": "The limited potential for achieving performance parity with established rigid robotic architectures.", "D": "The reliance on specialized materials that are prohibitively expensive for mass production."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \u201cThese systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\u201d This directly addresses the obstacle to deployment.", "question_token_count": 41, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 7, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 14}
{"context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al.

{"context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n", "topic": "A future scenario envisions parallel development of both invasive and noninvasive approaches to cater to patient preferences regarding stability and surgical tolerance.", "question": "Considering the described trajectory of RPH development, encompassing both invasive and noninvasive approaches, what is the most critical technological hurdle that would necessitate a shift from a purely parallel development strategy towards prioritizing a single, dominant technology?", "choices": {"A": "Achieving consistently low latency (<300ms) across both invasive and noninvasive systems simultaneously.", "B": "Overcoming the limitations of miniaturization and power consumption in embedded electronics to support complex decoding models in both approaches.", "C": "Developing robust and reliable online artifact removal techniques for intraneural electrodes, effectively mitigating a primary weakness of the invasive approach.", "D": "Establishing a universal standard for patient preference regarding stability versus surgical tolerance, simplifying the dual-path development strategy."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that online artifact removal remains a \u201cimportant challenge\u201d for intraneural electrodes, suggesting it\u2019s a significant barrier to their widespread adoption and potentially a reason to prioritize a single technology over a parallel one.

{"context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.).

{"context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n", "topic": "Addressing limitations in embedded electronic processing resources, such as power consumption and computational complexity, is crucial for miniaturizing RPH electronics.", "question": "Considering the described limitations regarding embedded processing in RPH electronics, which of the following best encapsulates the fundamental trade-off researchers are actively attempting to resolve?", "choices": {"A": "Achieving higher decoding accuracy through increased electrode density, regardless of power consumption constraints.", "B": "Prioritizing seamless, low-latency control by exclusively utilizing invasive intraneural electrode interfaces.", "C": "Balancing computational complexity and power consumption by leveraging external processing resources like cloud computing to offset embedded limitations.", "D": "Eliminating the need for signal recalibration by implementing static, non-adaptive decoding algorithms."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C.

( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Magnetic Table Task and Sensory Encoding Strategies", "question": "Considering the description of the magnetic table task and its relationship to sensory encoding strategies, what primary cognitive process does the task\u2019s reliance on magnetic cubes and breakable objects fundamentally challenge the assessment of?", "choices": {"A": "The participant\u2019s ability to accurately judge the size of objects.", "B": "The participant\u2019s capacity for sustained attention and dual-task performance, indirectly reflecting cognitive load.", "C": "The participant\u2019s proficiency in manipulating objects with fine motor skills.", "D": "The participant\u2019s sensitivity to visual cues related to object color and shape."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that the magnetic table task and Virtual Egg test are used to evaluate sensory encoding strategies and assess cognitive load.

{"context": "## 6. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160). It assesses four basic movements: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movements of extension and flexion at the elbow and shoulder. Variously sized and shaped objects from daily living (a cup, a washer, etc.) are used for the test, which provides a broad overview of patients' improvement in the activity and impairment domains. Finally, the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure uses a set of abstract objects and activities of daily living with tasks specifically developed to assess the effectiveness of upper-limb prostheses (161).\n", "topic": "Evaluating patient acceptance of RPH protocols through metrics such as treatment adherence and session frequency.", "question": "Considering the emphasis on patient acceptance and treatment adherence within RPH protocols, how would a researcher most effectively utilize session frequency and the number of sessions carried out per month as metrics to gauge the success of a novel RPH implementation, and what potential confounding factors might necessitate further investigation alongside these core measures?", "choices": {"A": "Session frequency and session length should be the sole metrics, as they directly correlate with treatment adherence and patient satisfaction.", "B": "Session frequency and session length offer a preliminary indication of treatment adherence, but require supplementation with qualitative data to understand the *reasons* behind adherence levels and potential barriers.", "C": "Session frequency and session length are irrelevant metrics for evaluating RPH success, as patient perception of quality of life is the most critical factor.", "D": "Session frequency and session length should be combined with the DASH questionnaire to provide a comprehensive assessment of patient functional status."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) acknowledges the utility of session frequency and length as indicators of adherence but emphasizes the need for deeper understanding.

CONCLUSION\nMorethan20years ago,remarkable results by a group of French surgeons for hand transplantation (8) had raised hopes for a future where grafting would be the norm and prosthetics eventually obsolete (176). However, not only has this prediction-unfortunately-not yet come to pass, but also the adoption of new RPH technologies has been slower than expected. As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback. We have proposed here an outline of possible iterations of RPHs for the next few years and for 5-10 years in the future.\n\nIn our view, there could soon be a broader integration of simple somatosensory feedback using mature implantable techniques, such as cuff electrodes. Motor decoding using machine learning and shared-control algorithms could permit continuous command of single fingers and broader sets of grasps. Ultimately, the next generation of prosthetics could use more advanced soft implantable electrodes, which could enable more sophisticated sensory encoding (proprioception, temperature perception, touch perception, and nociception) and motor decoding using, for example, deep learning techniques. But to reach this goal, the field must tackle significant challenges related to system integration, electronic miniaturization, computational power, surgical procedure, electrode robustness, the robotic hand itself, and the encoding of somatosensory information.\n", "topic": "The initial optimism surrounding hand transplantation research and its subsequent impact on the development of robotic prosthetic hands.", "question": "Despite initial optimism following hand transplantation research, what primary factor has contributed to the slower-than-expected progression of robotic prosthetic hand technology?", "choices": {"A": "A lack of funding for research into advanced materials.", "B": "The inherent complexity of replicating the intricate neural pathways involved in natural hand function.", "C": "The limited availability of skilled surgeons capable of performing hand transplants.", "D": "The unanticipated difficulties in integrating sophisticated sensory feedback mechanisms."}, "answer": "D", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that RPH adoption has been slower than expected and identifies significant challenges related to system integration, including the encoding of somatosensory information.", "question_token_count": 28, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 7, "question_groundedness_score": 6, "avg_answer_token_count": 13}

Merkel disks and Ruffini capsules are slow-adapting receptors, meaning that they fire continuously during tactile stimuli, with a firing rate related to the pressure applied in their receptive field.

{"context": "## 6. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160). It assesses four basic movements: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movements of extension and flexion at the elbow and shoulder. Variously sized and shaped objects from daily living (a cup, a washer, etc.) are used for the test, which provides a broad overview of patients' improvement in the activity and impairment domains. Finally, the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure uses a set of abstract objects and activities of daily living with tasks specifically developed to assess the effectiveness of upper-limb prostheses (161).\n", "topic": "The importance of evaluating RPHs across biological, psychosocial, and functional domains (impairments, activity limitations, and participation).", "question": "Beyond biological impairments, activity limitations, and participation, what specific psychosocial consequence of a rehabilitation technology should an RPH assessment explicitly consider, and how does this consideration impact the selection of appropriate evaluation metrics?", "choices": {"A": "The primary psychosocial consequence is the individual\u2019s reintegration into society, necessitating metrics that assess social support and community involvement.", "B": "The assessment should focus solely on the patient's perceived disability, as this directly correlates with their functional recovery.", "C": "The psychosocial consequence is the technology\u2019s impact on the caregiver\u2019s burden, requiring metrics centered on caregiver satisfaction and reduced workload.", "D": "The assessment should prioritize the patient's adherence to the prescribed protocol, measured by session frequency and duration."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support reintegration into society.

{"context": "## 5. RESTORING SENSORY FEEDBACK\nSensory information plays a critical role in both the exploration of the external environment and in any manipulation task. When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface. Prec vious sections have described the different available interfaces; here, we present the encoding techniques and sensors relevant to the design of modern hand prostheses ( Table 1 ).\n\nSensors mounted on a robotic hand should ideally record the whole spectrum of available human sensations, from both external and internal sources. Indeed, sensory information from the human hand covers both interactions with the external world (tactile perception, thermal perception, and nociception, i.e., perception of pain) and internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles, together known as proprioception. Table 2 shows examples of sensor placements on RPHs from recent studies.\n", "topic": "What are the three fundamental blocks required for the design of a successful sensory feedback system in a hand prosthesis?", "question": "What are the three fundamental blocks necessary for the design of a successful sensory feedback system within a hand prosthesis, as detailed in the provided text?", "choices": {"A": "Sensors, actuators, and power supply.", "B": "Sensors, encoding strategies, and interfaces.", "C": "Motors, control algorithms, and mechanical structure.", "D": "Tactile sensors, proprioceptive sensors, and visual feedback."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that a successful system requires \u201csensor readings, processed by an encoding strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through an interface.\u201d This directly corresponds to the option B.", "question_token_count": 30, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 4, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 10}
{"context": "## 4.2. Shared Control to Help Motor Decoding\nThe ultimate goal of RPH control is to be as close as possible to controlling a natural hand. Therefore, an ideal control needs to be intuitive and continuous over individual fingers and wrist movements. Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder. Since reliability is one of the main factors for upper-limb prosthesis users (102), this is a significant issue for the commercialization of more dexterous control schemes.\n\nOne possible solution to improve decoding robustness is to add robotic automation of some portion of the motor command. Shared-control strategies between a subject and a smart robotic hand have been reported for automated preshaping and grasping (103), grip force adjustment\n\n(104), slip detection, and hand closing (105). In the context of single-finger proportional control, Zhuang et al. (79) proposed a shared-control strategy to increase grasp robustness (avoiding accidental drops), by maximizing the number of contacts between the RPH and an object while allowing the user to maintain full autonomy over decisions about grasping and releasing, grasp preshaping, and non-grasp-related motions. These strategies allow both freedom during singlefinger control and robustness during a grasp event (79) and can perform more dexterous movements that cannot be decoded based on EMG alone. However, they necessitate many DOAs (e.g., active control of each phalanx to reposition the fingers around an object), which is still a significant challenge in terms of motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\n", "topic": "What is the fundamental trade-off discussed in the text regarding increasing dexterity in robotic hands?", "question": "What represents the core trade-off discussed regarding advancements in robotic hand dexterity, as presented in the text?", "choices": {"A": "Increased motor miniaturization leads to enhanced grip force adjustment.", "B": "Greater degrees of freedom inherently reduce the system's overall reliability.", "C": "Shared control strategies eliminate the need for active control of individual finger movements.", "D": "Proportional control improves intuitive user interaction but simplifies slip detection."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that \"Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder.\"", "question_token_count": 22, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 13}

( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ).

As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback.

INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "The inherent complexity of replicating natural hand function in robotic prosthetic hands, considering the high density of mechanoreceptors and degrees of freedom.", "question": "Considering the high density of mechanoreceptors and the multitude of degrees of freedom present in a natural hand, what is the primary limiting factor hindering the successful replication of this functionality in current robotic prosthetic hand designs?", "choices": {"A": "The limited computational power available for processing sensory input.", "B": "The difficulty in achieving precise motor control due to the complexity of human movement patterns.", "C": "The inherent challenge of mimicking the high density of mechanoreceptors and the associated neural pathways required for nuanced tactile feedback.", "D": "The cost of advanced materials used in prosthetic hand construction."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C.

{"context": "## 5.5. Perspectives\nWe believe that sensorization will play a significant role in the next generation of RPHs. Here, we discuss three main directions influenced by sensorization: embedded sensorization, improved stimulation strategies, and new computational architectures.\n\n5.5.1. Embedded sensorization. Sensorized hands are not yet prevalent in the literature but are starting to draw interest, especially with the improvement of interfaces for bidirectional prostheses (for a list of RPHs with sensorized fingertips, see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). As a recent example, Controzzi et al. (141) developed the Mia hand (Prensilia, Italy), which is integrated with sensors that can measure normal and tangential forces at the fingertips. Sensorization of RPHs is a design requirement that should be considered as important as other functional requirements for hand prostheses, such as weight or dexterity. T o improve RPH performance and sensor integration, next-generation RPHs should then be designed with their sensorization in mind. Information about hand state (joint position, forces, and touch) can also be beneficial to increase the dexterity of such hands, enabling automatic adjustments such as catching slipping objects (e.g., the bebionic3 hand) and shared-control strategies (see Section 4).\n\n5.5.2. Improved stimulation strategies. Biomimicry is one of the strongest trends in nerve stimulation strategies, as it promises to deliver biologically plausible stimulation patterns to evoke more natural sensations. Biomimetic approaches rely on bio-inspired models to compute the stimulation patterns, so new iterations of these models, based on the current experience in stimulation and neural recording, are needed to improve the quality of elicited sensations.\n\nThese model-based approaches permit simpler modulation strategies that increase the naturalness of sensations. T an et al. (38), for example, proved that a sinusoidal modulation of the pulse width improves the naturalness of the sensation. Formento et al. (142) instead designed a strategy to activate asynchronously stimulated fibers, mimicking healthy neural activity; in their work, they replaced classical biphasic stimulation with a high-frequency burst of pulses that slowly increased in amplitude, and confirmed their hypothesis in ex vivo experiments. Stimulation patterns that try to overcome the physical limits of present neural interfaces (as in 142) while paving the way for more natural evoked sensations also suggest the requirements for the future generation of neural interfaces and stimulators for sensory feedback: increase reaching without losing discrimination.\n\n5.5.3. New computational architectures. Neuromorphic architectures have the potential to represent a paradigm shift in the design of the control systems for bidirectional hand prostheses, going toward distributed systems and edge computing. Both sensor acquisition and stimulation can benefit from these trends because they lead to more reliable systems that scale well with the increase of sensors and stimulation active sites. If the next generation of neuromorphic hardware promotes portability and lower power consumption, it could lead to broader implementation and adoption of neuromorphic systems in bidirectional hand prostheses.\n\nMany RPHs rely on advanced encoding and decoding algorithms implemented with neural networks (62), which are more computationally demanding than traditional approaches. It is interesting that even deep learning networks can be translated into spiking neural networks (143), possibly enabling full neuromorphic hardware encoding and decoding in future prostheses.\n", "topic": "What is the potential impact of neuromorphic architectures on the control systems of bidirectional hand prostheses, and what are the advantages of distributed systems and edge computing in this context?", "question": "Considering the computational demands of deep learning-based control systems in bidirectional hand prostheses, how would the integration of neuromorphic architectures and distributed processing, specifically leveraging edge computing, fundamentally alter the system\u2019s responsiveness and the complexity of required sensor data encoding?", "choices": {"A": "Neuromorphic architectures would primarily reduce power consumption, allowing for more sensors without impacting control latency.", "B": "Distributed processing would introduce significant latency due to the increased communication overhead between processing units, diminishing the benefits of neuromorphic computation.", "C": "The shift to neuromorphic systems and edge computing would enable real-time decoding of complex sensor data streams, facilitating adaptive control strategies and mimicking natural hand movements with greater fidelity.", "D": "Implementing neuromorphic architectures would necessitate a complete redesign of the hand prosthesis, rendering existing sensor data encoding methods obsolete."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer (C) accurately reflects the text's argument that neuromorphic architectures and distributed systems, especially edge computing, would enable real-time processing of complex sensor data, leading to more adaptive and natural control.

{"context": "## 5.1. Sensors for Proprioception\nProprioception is not only fundamental for a dexterous hand prosthesis, enabling vision-free manipulation and multitasking, but is also the key to a properly embodied device (64). Usually, kinematic parameters of the robotic hand and (when available) the force exerted are needed to implement low-level control of the actuators, so they are measured with well-established systems, such as rotary encoders or the motor's current draw.\n\n\n## 5.2. Tactile Sensors\nDespite improvements in sensor miniaturization,computational power,and knowledge of the neurophysiology of somatosensation (tactile sensation and proprioception), the capabilities of sensorized RPHs remain far from those of a natural hand. Overcoming this limitation will require satisfying three conditions: The sensors must match the skin's sensing ability, a sufficient number of sensors must be embedded on the surface of the hand, and it must be possible to reliably read information from them. The first condition can be addressed with current technology, as the resolution of existing force and pressure sensors already matches human skin performance (120). However, fulfilling the second and third conditions is another matter, and we need to push the boundaries of circuit integration in order to create an RPH with many sensors and a way to communicate with them.\n\nThe classical solution of using general-purpose sensors developed separately from the signal conditioning circuit and the subsequent signal processing has shown its limit. Instead, efforts are being made to optimize these devices with prosthetics in mind. For example, borrowing the concept of morphological computation from robotics (121), sensors can be optimized for specific tasks by tuning the features of their mechanical structures accordingly. Indeed, exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination (61, 115). Another example comes from Kim et al. (122), who measured forces using sensors embedded in a soft substrate.\n\n)\n\nContinued\n\n(\n\n| Sensor distribution a                       |            |             |             |             |                  |              |                 |              |\n\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n\n| Interface                                   | G10 tactor | TIME        | TENS        | TIME        | FINE             | TIME         | Vibrators       | TENS         |\n\n| Electrical stimulation encoding Pulse width | -          | Fixed       | Linear      | Fixed       | Time variant     | Fixed        | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Amplitude                                   | -          | Linear      | Fixed       | Model based | Fixed            | Fixed        | -               | Fixed        |\n\n| Frequency                                   | -          | Fixed       | Fixed       | Model based | Linear           | Neuromorphic | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Mechanical stimulation encoding             | Linear     | -           | -           | -           | -                | -            | Discrete events | -            |\n\n| RPH model                                   | Passive    | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | SensorHand Speed | IH2 Azzurra  | Various         | bebionic     |\n\n| Reference                                   | 4          | 6           | 60          | 62          | 38               | 61           | 129             | 59           |\n\n| Year                                        | 2011       | 2014        | 2017        | 2018        | 2014             | 2016         | 2016            | 2018         |\n", "topic": "The application of morphological computation in optimizing sensors for specific robotic hand tasks.", "question": "Considering the described approach of utilizing morphological computation to optimize sensors for robotic hands, what fundamental principle underlies the effectiveness of tailoring sensor mechanical structures for specific tasks, as highlighted in the provided text?", "choices": {"A": "Morphological computation inherently enhances sensor resolution by increasing the density of individual sensing elements.", "B": "Optimizing sensor mechanical structures leverages the passive filtering properties of compliant materials to improve texture discrimination.", "C": "Morphological computation exploits model-based frequency encoding to achieve nuanced control over sensor output, mimicking the dynamic range of human tactile perception.", "D": "Tailoring sensor structures allows for the implementation of neuromorphic stimulation patterns, directly translating neural signals into mechanical actuation."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that \"exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination.\" This directly reflects the principle of morphological computation as described.

{"context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Cognitive Load Assessment in Sensorimotor Tasks", "question": "Considering the described assessments of RPHs, what potential confounding factor, beyond simple task difficulty, might explain why a patient performing a task like the Virtual Egg Test exhibits a smaller event-related potential response to an auditory cue indicating a stimulus proximity?", "choices": {"A": "The patient\u2019s prior experience with similar sensory feedback modalities.", "B": "The patient\u2019s cognitive load, specifically the demands of the primary task being performed concurrently.", "C": "The patient\u2019s inherent sensitivity to auditory stimuli.", "D": "The calibration of the auditory stimulus\u2019s intensity."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that a small response to the auditory cue suggests a greater cognitive load, implying the patient is prioritizing the primary task over the secondary auditory stimulus.", "question_token_count": 49, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 12}
{"context": "## 4. MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach. Section 4.1 details different algorithmic approaches to decode motor functions, with an emphasis on sEMG; Section 4.2 discusses the addition of robotic automation to improve grasp robustness; Section 4.3 compares implanted methods to extract the user's intentions; and finally, Section 4.4 presents a perspective on the broader adoption of these techniques by patients.

{"context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60).

{"context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n", "topic": "The differences between motor and sensory interfaces in soft robotic systems, including examples of current and future technologies.", "question": "Considering the maturation levels presented in Table 1, what fundamental technological hurdle primarily constrains the widespread deployment of soft robotic systems utilizing asynchronous coded electronic skin for sensorization?", "choices": {"A": "The limited bandwidth of current wireless communication protocols restricts the volume of data transmitted from the sensors.", "B": "The inherent fragility of the electronic skin material, necessitating frequent replacements and impacting long-term reliability.", "C": "The lack of standardized protocols for interpreting and translating the complex, multi-dimensional data generated by asynchronous coded electronic skin into actionable motor commands.", "D": "The substantial cost associated with manufacturing the specialized conductive polymers required for asynchronous coded electronic skin, hindering scalability."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C.

{"context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Validity of RPH Evaluations and Future Measurement Needs", "question": "Considering the diverse assessment tools presented, what specific methodological challenge arises when attempting to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of RPH rehabilitation interventions utilizing sensory feedback, as highlighted in the text?", "choices": {"A": "The reliance on subjective questionnaires like the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Visual Analog Pain intensity scale inherently limits the objectivity of pain assessment.", "B": "The lack of clinically validated measurements for RPHs, particularly those integrating sensory feedback, necessitates the development and validation of novel assessment methodologies.", "C": "The inherent difficulty in isolating the influence of sensory feedback from other contributing factors, such as neuromas and cortical reorganization, poses a significant challenge to interpreting test results.", "D": "The predominantly neurological focus of existing evaluations, while valuable, fails to adequately address the complex biopsychosocial factors influencing RPH outcomes."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \u201cThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers. Sensory remapping (65) can be another viable solution to simulate temperature feedback on a different part of the body using a temperature display.\n", "topic": "Describe the current limitations of implantable electrodes regarding sensory modalities beyond tactile feedback.", "question": "Considering the physiological characteristics of sensory nerve fibers, which of the following represents the primary impediment to effectively stimulating temperature-sensitive neurons with implantable electrodes?", "choices": {"A": "The limited bandwidth of current amplification systems.", "B": "The difficulty in achieving precise electrode placement due to tissue variability.", "C": "The extremely small diameter of A \u03b4 and C fibers, rendering them inaccessible with existing electrode technology.", "D": "The inherent invasiveness of implantable electrode arrays."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \"Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes.\"", "question_token_count": 30, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 13}
{"context": "## 5. RESTORING SENSORY FEEDBACK\nSensory information plays a critical role in both the exploration of the external environment and in any manipulation task. When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface. Prec vious sections have described the different available interfaces; here, we present the encoding techniques and sensors relevant to the design of modern hand prostheses ( Table 1 ).\n\nSensors mounted on a robotic hand should ideally record the whole spectrum of available human sensations, from both external and internal sources. Indeed, sensory information from the human hand covers both interactions with the external world (tactile perception, thermal perception, and nociception, i.e., perception of pain) and internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles, together known as proprioception. Table 2 shows examples of sensor placements on RPHs from recent studies.\n", "topic": "Explain how sensor readings are translated into meaningful information for the user within a sensory feedback system, as described in the text.", "question": "Within a sensory feedback system, what is the primary function of the \u201cencoding strategy\u201d described in the text?", "choices": {"A": "To physically mount sensors onto a robotic hand.", "B": "To directly interpret raw sensor data into visual representations for the user.", "C": "To translate sensor readings into a format that represents meaningful tactile, thermal, and proprioceptive information for the user.", "D": "To manage the power supply for the various sensors used in the system."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C.

{"context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n", "topic": "The maturity levels and current state of various technologies associated with soft robotics, as outlined in Table 1.", "question": "Considering the current state of soft robotic interfaces as detailed in Table 1, what fundamental integration challenge, beyond simple hardware development, would most significantly impede the transition of \u201ccutting edge, laboratory use\u201d technologies like \u201cSimultaneous single-finger classification\u201d towards \u201cmature, home use\u201d applications?", "choices": {"A": "The limited availability of biocompatible materials suitable for long-term implantation of regenerative electrodes.", "B": "The lack of standardized protocols for translating complex sensor data into intuitive and actionable feedback for users.", "C": "The prohibitive cost of manufacturing high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) systems.", "D": "The inherent instability of granular jamming actuators in dynamic environments."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 4.3. Decoding Motor Intention via Implanted Electrodes\nSurface electrodes cannot precisely record the signal from deep muscles; to overcome this issue, several groups have focused on iEMG electrodes. This technique is more invasive but allows one to record EMG signals (51) uncorrelated from the underlying musculature and avoids the daily placement of electrodes. iEMG is robust against electrode shift (e.g., socket rotation) and change in skin impedance and sweat. Several studies have demonstrated the performance of simultaneous wrist and hand motions (three DOFs) using six to eight iEMG electrodes; Smith &amp; Hargrove (51) showed that iEMG has better decoding performance than sEMG. High decoding performance is reported in real time (106), and in fully implanted setups, the results are stable for several days (107).\n\nOnthe other hand, Farrell &amp; Weir (52) compared the pattern recognition-based grasp classification performance of iEMG and sEMG on 12 movement classes with eight channels and did not find a statistical difference between electrode types. They concluded that the choice of electrode should be based not on classification accuracy but rather on signal consistency over time and robustness to electrode lift-off. Zia ur Rehman et al. (108) compared a standard linear discriminant analysis with a deep network for grasp classification. They performed a multiday analysis comparing six iEMG and six sEMG electrodes, and their results showed that deep learning had better decoding performance and was more stable over time.\n\nKamavuako et al. (109) investigated the effect of combining iEMG to target deep muscles with sEMG on myoelectric control. They showed that the combined solution improved offline and real-time control performance compared with sEMG alone.\n\nWith 32 iEMG electrodes, Dantas et al. (110) compared different decoding methods for the continuous control of five DOFs corresponding to the flexion and extension of each digit. Using a data set aggregation algorithm, they showed a normalized mean squared error as low as 0.033 with a deep convolutional neural network. They also investigated signal stability for 150 days after training, showing a small degradation during the first month (0.003 normalized mean squared error per day with a convolutional neural network), but that degradation stopped in the next four months.\n\nFor transradial amputees, an alternative to using EMG signals to control hand prostheses is decoding from peripheral nerve signals. Different grasp types can be decoded from peripheral nerve signals with high accuracy using different interfaces, both offline and in real time (54, 111113). Implanted peripheral nerve recordings are more invasive than sEMG but are more stable over time. Indeed, donning and doffing the prosthesis does not move these electrodes as much as it does sEMG electrodes. Recently, Cracchiolo et al. (53) decoded up to 11 class states using TIMEs on an amputee subject and showed that the active sites chosen on the first day could also be used in the following sessions, for up to seven days (80% accuracy, compared with 83% by selecting active sites every session). However, this modality is generally used to provide sensory\n\nfeedback (64, 114-116). Therefore the development of new approaches to record neural signals during peripheral stimulation [e.g., artifact removal (117)] is necessary.\n\nVu et al. (39) recently developed a regenerative peripheral nerve interface to increase signal specificity and long-term stability. They implanted transected peripheral nerves into a free muscle graft. After regeneration, revascularization, and reinnervation, the graft becomes a nerve bioamplifier that creates EMG signals. Using chronically implanted iEMG to record from these grafts, they performed five-class decoding in real time with up to 98.2% accuracy with two transradial amputees in a virtual hand environment. They also showed results from a Box and Block T est using an RPH that provided continuous control of two DOFs of thumb motions through their interface combined with a third DOF based on sEMG.\n", "topic": "Recent advancements in regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces and their potential to improve the specificity and long-term stability of neural signal recording.", "question": "Considering the regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPH) approach described by Vu et al., what is the primary mechanism by which the muscle graft contributes to enhanced signal specificity and long-term stability compared to traditional implanted electrode systems?", "choices": {"A": "The muscle graft passively filters out extraneous noise, improving the signal-to-noise ratio during neural recording.", "B": "The muscle graft acts as a bioamplifier, amplifying the weak neural signals generated during nerve regeneration, thereby increasing signal strength and reducing the need for extensive electrode arrays.", "C": "The muscle graft\u2019s vascularization provides a continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen to the regenerating nerves, accelerating the regeneration process and maintaining signal fidelity.", "D": "The muscle graft\u2019s inherent contractile properties allow for real-time feedback control, improving the accuracy of motor intention decoding."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 5.4. Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n", "topic": "Explain how sensor values are encoded into stimulation parameters in electrical interfaces for RPH feedback.", "question": "In the context of RPH electrical interfaces, what fundamental relationship is established between encoded sensor values and the resulting stimulation parameters?", "choices": {"A": "Sensor values directly determine the stimulation amplitude, with no consideration for frequency.", "B": "Stimulation parameters are calibrated inversely to sensor values to ensure precise motor control.", "C": "Sensor values are transformed into stimulation parameters to evoke a coherent sensory experience reflecting desired movement.", "D": "Stimulation parameters are solely determined by mechanical factors, independent of sensor input."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that \u201csensory feedback strategies encode sensor values to stimulation parameters,\u201d highlighting the crucial link between the two.", "question_token_count": 25, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 16}
{"context": "## 4.2. Shared Control to Help Motor Decoding\nThe ultimate goal of RPH control is to be as close as possible to controlling a natural hand. Therefore, an ideal control needs to be intuitive and continuous over individual fingers and wrist movements. Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder. Since reliability is one of the main factors for upper-limb prosthesis users (102), this is a significant issue for the commercialization of more dexterous control schemes.\n\nOne possible solution to improve decoding robustness is to add robotic automation of some portion of the motor command. Shared-control strategies between a subject and a smart robotic hand have been reported for automated preshaping and grasping (103), grip force adjustment\n\n(104), slip detection, and hand closing (105). In the context of single-finger proportional control, Zhuang et al. (79) proposed a shared-control strategy to increase grasp robustness (avoiding accidental drops), by maximizing the number of contacts between the RPH and an object while allowing the user to maintain full autonomy over decisions about grasping and releasing, grasp preshaping, and non-grasp-related motions. These strategies allow both freedom during singlefinger control and robustness during a grasp event (79) and can perform more dexterous movements that cannot be decoded based on EMG alone. However, they necessitate many DOAs (e.g., active control of each phalanx to reposition the fingers around an object), which is still a significant challenge in terms of motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\n", "topic": "Describe the various motor automation tasks that shared-control strategies can facilitate, according to the provided text.", "question": "According to the text, which of the following motor automation tasks is MOST effectively facilitated by shared-control strategies implemented in robotic hands?", "choices": {"A": "Autonomous limb movement planning without user input.", "B": "Precise, individual finger repositioning to optimize contact with an object.", "C": "Automated grip force adjustment to maintain a desired pressure on an object.", "D": "Complete replacement of user control with robotic motor commands."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly mentions automated preshaping, grasping, grip force adjustment, slip detection, and hand closing as tasks facilitated by shared-control strategies.

{"context": "## 5.1. Sensors for Proprioception\nProprioception is not only fundamental for a dexterous hand prosthesis, enabling vision-free manipulation and multitasking, but is also the key to a properly embodied device (64). Usually, kinematic parameters of the robotic hand and (when available) the force exerted are needed to implement low-level control of the actuators, so they are measured with well-established systems, such as rotary encoders or the motor's current draw.\n\n\n## 5.2. Tactile Sensors\nDespite improvements in sensor miniaturization,computational power,and knowledge of the neurophysiology of somatosensation (tactile sensation and proprioception), the capabilities of sensorized RPHs remain far from those of a natural hand. Overcoming this limitation will require satisfying three conditions: The sensors must match the skin's sensing ability, a sufficient number of sensors must be embedded on the surface of the hand, and it must be possible to reliably read information from them. The first condition can be addressed with current technology, as the resolution of existing force and pressure sensors already matches human skin performance (120). However, fulfilling the second and third conditions is another matter, and we need to push the boundaries of circuit integration in order to create an RPH with many sensors and a way to communicate with them.\n\nThe classical solution of using general-purpose sensors developed separately from the signal conditioning circuit and the subsequent signal processing has shown its limit. Instead, efforts are being made to optimize these devices with prosthetics in mind. For example, borrowing the concept of morphological computation from robotics (121), sensors can be optimized for specific tasks by tuning the features of their mechanical structures accordingly. Indeed, exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination (61, 115). Another example comes from Kim et al. (122), who measured forces using sensors embedded in a soft substrate.\n\n)\n\nContinued\n\n(\n\n| Sensor distribution a                       |            |             |             |             |                  |              |                 |              |\n\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n\n| Interface                                   | G10 tactor | TIME        | TENS        | TIME        | FINE             | TIME         | Vibrators       | TENS         |\n\n| Electrical stimulation encoding Pulse width | -          | Fixed       | Linear      | Fixed       | Time variant     | Fixed        | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Amplitude                                   | -          | Linear      | Fixed       | Model based | Fixed            | Fixed        | -               | Fixed        |\n\n| Frequency                                   | -          | Fixed       | Fixed       | Model based | Linear           | Neuromorphic | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Mechanical stimulation encoding             | Linear     | -           | -           | -           | -                | -            | Discrete events | -            |\n\n| RPH model                                   | Passive    | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | SensorHand Speed | IH2 Azzurra  | Various         | bebionic     |\n\n| Reference                                   | 4          | 6           | 60          | 62          | 38               | 61           | 129             | 59           |\n\n| Year                                        | 2011       | 2014        | 2017        | 2018        | 2014             | 2016         | 2016            | 2018         |\n", "topic": "The relationship between RPH models and sensor distributions, as exemplified by the data presented in the provided table.", "question": "Considering the data presented in the table, which RPH model demonstrably leverages a \"model-based\" approach to frequency encoding, as indicated by its corresponding sensor distribution?", "choices": {"A": "IH2 Azzurra", "B": "SensorHand Speed", "C": "Neuromorphic", "D": "Passive"}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The table clearly indicates that the \u201cSensorHand Speed\u201d RPH model utilizes a \u201cTime variant\u201d frequency encoding approach.

The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Evaluation of Peripersonal Space Perception", "question": "Considering the diverse assessment tools described, what fundamental limitation does the text suggest regarding the current availability of validated measurements for evaluating Peripersonal Space, particularly in the context of integrating sensory feedback?", "choices": {"A": "Current assessments primarily focus on gross motor function, neglecting the critical role of tactile and proprioceptive feedback in PPS representation.", "B": "The lack of standardized protocols and clinical validation hinders the consistent application and interpretation of existing tools, posing a challenge for evaluating novel technologies.", "C": "Most established tests are exclusively designed for patients with stroke, limiting their generalizability to other neurological conditions.", "D": "The reliance on subjective measures, such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire, overshadows the objective assessment of spatial perception."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states \u201cThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH\u201d and highlights a \u201clack of validated and well-established measurements.\u201d Option B directly reflects this statement.", "question_token_count": 38, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 24}
{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Detail the rationale behind employing biomimetic stimulation patterns, referencing specific studies (George et al., Valle et al.) that illustrate their effectiveness.", "question": "What were the key findings of George et al.

{"context": "## 6. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160).

{"context": "## 7. CONCLUSION\nMorethan20years ago,remarkable results by a group of French surgeons for hand transplantation (8) had raised hopes for a future where grafting would be the norm and prosthetics eventually obsolete (176). However, not only has this prediction-unfortunately-not yet come to pass, but also the adoption of new RPH technologies has been slower than expected. As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback. We have proposed here an outline of possible iterations of RPHs for the next few years and for 5-10 years in the future.\n\nIn our view, there could soon be a broader integration of simple somatosensory feedback using mature implantable techniques, such as cuff electrodes. Motor decoding using machine learning and shared-control algorithms could permit continuous command of single fingers and broader sets of grasps. Ultimately, the next generation of prosthetics could use more advanced soft implantable electrodes, which could enable more sophisticated sensory encoding (proprioception, temperature perception, touch perception, and nociception) and motor decoding using, for example, deep learning techniques. But to reach this goal, the field must tackle significant challenges related to system integration, electronic miniaturization, computational power, surgical procedure, electrode robustness, the robotic hand itself, and the encoding of somatosensory information.\n", "topic": "The key technological advancements being pursued to improve the functionality and aesthetics of RPHs, including motor intention decoding and somatosensory feedback.", "question": "Considering the proposed advancements in RPHs, what is the most significant bottleneck impeding the seamless integration of sophisticated somatosensory feedback alongside enhanced motor intention decoding?", "choices": {"A": "Primarily, limitations in the miniaturization of electronic components required for both systems.", "B": "The development of robust, shared-control algorithms capable of accurately translating complex motor commands into coordinated hand movements.", "C": "The challenges associated with reliably encoding and transmitting nuanced somatosensory information \u2013 including proprioception, temperature, touch, and nociception \u2013 to the user\u2019s nervous system.", "D": "Surgical procedure and electrode robustness, as these are the most difficult aspects of RPH implementation."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that \u201cto reach this goal, the field must tackle significant challenges related to system integration, electronic miniaturization, computational power, surgical procedure, electrode robustness, the robotic hand itself, and the encoding of somatosensory information.\u201d While all options represent challenges, the text\u2019s emphasis on \u201cencoding of somatosensory information\u201d highlights this as a primary hurdle.", "question_token_count": 33, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 23}
{"context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n", "topic": "Low latency (under 300ms) is a critical requirement for seamless prosthesis control, currently limiting the feasibility of complex decoding models.", "question": "Considering the described limitations on embedded processing and wireless communication infrastructure, what architectural shift \u2013 beyond simply utilizing cloud computing \u2013 would most effectively address the stringent latency requirement for complex prosthetic decoding models?", "choices": {"A": "Prioritizing the development of ultra-low-power, dedicated microcontrollers optimized exclusively for real-time decoding algorithms, sacrificing general-purpose functionality.", "B": "Implementing a hierarchical decoding system where complex models are executed remotely on a cloud server, relying on a low-latency wireless link for command transmission.", "C": "Employing a distributed decoding architecture across multiple, strategically placed wearable sensors to reduce the reliance on a single, computationally limited embedded processor.", "D": "Focusing exclusively on non-invasive EMG techniques, accepting the need for frequent recalibration as a necessary trade-off for avoiding surgical intervention."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) acknowledges the limitations of embedded systems while proposing a solution leveraging external computing power.

{"context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n", "topic": "The challenges associated with electrode placement accuracy and the development of HD-sEMG as a solution to improve robustness to electrode shifts and variations in individual anatomy.", "question": "Considering the challenges of electrode placement accuracy and the proposed solution of HD-sEMG, what is the primary advantage of utilizing a grid of closely spaced electrodes as described in the text, specifically in relation to mitigating the impact of electrode shifts?", "choices": {"A": "HD-sEMG allows for the direct extraction of hand-crafted features from the sEMG signal, resulting in robust grasp classification regardless of electrode displacement.", "B": "The large number of electrodes in HD-sEMG enables the recording of spatial images of EMG activity, making the system inherently resistant to small electrode shifts.", "C": "HD-sEMG\u2019s structural similarity index, borrowed from computer vision, provides a reliable method for correcting electrode placement inaccuracies.", "D": "Decomposition of the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potentials, facilitated by HD-sEMG, inherently compensates for variations in individual anatomy."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Assessment of Hand Function and Motor Skills", "question": "Considering the diverse assessment tools described, what fundamental cognitive challenge underlies the successful integration of sensory feedback within tasks like the Virtual Egg Test and the magnetic table task, as highlighted in the text?", "choices": {"A": "The primary challenge lies in accurately predicting the precise force required for successful grasping, necessitating complex calculations based on object weight and hardness.", "B": "The core difficulty resides in maintaining sustained attention to a secondary task (e.g., counting backward) while simultaneously performing a sensorimotor action, effectively managing cognitive load.", "C": "The central obstacle involves minimizing the potential for peripheral sensory distraction, ensuring complete focus on the primary task to avoid interference.", "D": "The fundamental challenge is accurately estimating the distance to the target, relying solely on visual cues to guide reaching movements."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that \u201cUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task\u201d and provides examples of secondary tasks used to measure this cognitive load.", "question_token_count": 39, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 27}
{"context": "## 5.4. Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n", "topic": "Describe the advantages and disadvantages of noninvasive versus mechanical feedback strategies for RPHs, citing specific examples.", "question": "Considering the inherent latency associated with mechanical feedback strategies, and the challenges of miniaturization for noninvasive approaches as detailed in the provided text, what is the most critical factor limiting the widespread adoption of noninvasive sensory feedback systems for RPHs?", "choices": {"A": "The high cost of surgical implantation required for some mechanical feedback interfaces.", "B": "The potential for user fatigue due to prolonged mechanical stimulation.", "C": "The unavoidable 400ms delay in sensation delivery and the difficulties in achieving miniaturization.", "D": "The limited availability of sophisticated motor technology suitable for precise stimulation."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states \"an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation\" for mechanical stimulation and highlights the \u201cchallenges of miniaturization\u201d for noninvasive approaches.

{"context": "## 2.1. Existing Robotic Prosthetic Hands\nNumerous commercially available RPH solutions use underactuated mechanisms ( Supplemental Table 1 ), including the Michelangelo prosthetic hand (Ottobock, Germany), the i-Limb Ultra (\u00d6ssur, Iceland), the bebionic hand (Ottobock), and the VINCENT evolution 3 (Vincent Systems, Germany). Despite remarkable advances, there is still arguably a trade-off between dexterity and weight in these solutions, with companies usually emphasizing one aspect or the other.\n\nMany research groups are currently working on innovative solutions to tackle the dexterity/ weight dilemma (19), such as the use of a monolithic 3D-printed soft material (20) or mechanical solutions to implement finger synergies via clutches (21). For example, Jing et al. (19) proposed an anthropomorphic RPH using only three motors that could achieve 13 grasp types while weighing only approximately 130 g.\n\nThe price of RPHs is an additional limiting factor for broader adoption by patients. With most advanced solutions costing $10,000-20,000, many researchers advocate for cheaper solutions, particularly for emerging countries (e.g., 22).\n\nOpen source RPHs are an exciting alternative to dramatically reduce the cost of development and distribution. One particularly interesting aspect of such hands is simplified maintenance and repairs (using, e.g., 3D printing) that do not rely on specific suppliers. For example, Open\n\nBionics (United Kingdom) commercializes solutions for transradial amputees (e.g., the medically certified Hero Arm) but also provides the source files for some of their designs, and e-NABLE ( https://enablingthefuture.org ) reports 8,000 recipients of their prosthetics, which were built by volunteers around the world. Open source RPHs also enable users to alter the design to meet their unique needs; for example, the Galileo Hand (23) allows easy customization of the types of movements and number of electromyography (EMG) electrodes.\n\nResearchers are also working on better mechanical solutions to improve RPH dexterity. An underactuated hand prosthesis designed by Abayasiri et al. (24) has finger abduction and adduction to enable it to grasp larger objects, and an adaptive prosthetic hand designed by Yong et al. (25) adds DOFs in the palm with movable metacarpals. The Karlsruhe Institute of T echnology (KIT) prosthetic hand (26) has an embedded camera and real-time object recognition, enabling the hand to be preshaped. Pneumatic artificial muscle (27) permits the development of light, compact solutions. Finally, biomimetic actuation is used for muscle-like actuators (15).\n\nIn addition to the hardware aspect, there are also innovations in RPH control and sensorization. Low-level controllers use information about the state of the device and eventually activate the actuation to meet the desired state imposed by the user's intentions. The choice of the state variable has a strong influence on how the device works. Position or speed can be read through encoders of each joint and controlled; these are straightforward approaches that have been used broadly in robotic applications. When the interaction of the hand with the external environment is of interest, more advanced control systems are implemented, such as torque or impedance control. Both approaches measure the force applied by the actuator, controlling it directly in the first case and simulating compliance in the second. Advanced control strategies enable complex manipulation and smoother gestures at the expense of a bulkier mechanical structure and a more complex control system. Therefore, enabling more sophisticated control requires integrated force and position sensors, which have been previously developed mainly to close the robotic control loop (28).\n\nIn summary, low-cost and light hands have flourished over the last few years. The race to simplify designs and reduce costs through 3D printing should not impact the dexterity of RPHs. For now, underactuated mechanisms are the best solution for RPHs and innovative designs based on synergy mechanisms or friction, the latter of which can help increase the number of DOAs without increasing the number of motors.\n", "topic": "The impact of 3D printing and open-source designs on the cost and accessibility of robotic prosthetic hands.", "question": "Beyond the immediate cost reduction facilitated by 3D printing, what is the most critical underlying driver motivating the widespread adoption of open-source robotic prosthetic hand designs and related technologies?", "choices": {"A": "The availability of low-cost, readily printable materials has superseded the need for complex manufacturing processes.", "B": "The decentralized nature of open-source development fosters rapid innovation and customization, addressing individual user needs more effectively than traditional, proprietary solutions.", "C": "Government regulations increasingly mandate the use of open-source designs to ensure accessibility and affordability in healthcare.", "D": "The primary impetus is the reduction of maintenance costs, as 3D-printed parts are inherently more durable than those produced using conventional methods."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 4.3. Decoding Motor Intention via Implanted Electrodes\nSurface electrodes cannot precisely record the signal from deep muscles; to overcome this issue, several groups have focused on iEMG electrodes. This technique is more invasive but allows one to record EMG signals (51) uncorrelated from the underlying musculature and avoids the daily placement of electrodes. iEMG is robust against electrode shift (e.g., socket rotation) and change in skin impedance and sweat. Several studies have demonstrated the performance of simultaneous wrist and hand motions (three DOFs) using six to eight iEMG electrodes; Smith &amp; Hargrove (51) showed that iEMG has better decoding performance than sEMG. High decoding performance is reported in real time (106), and in fully implanted setups, the results are stable for several days (107).\n\nOnthe other hand, Farrell &amp; Weir (52) compared the pattern recognition-based grasp classification performance of iEMG and sEMG on 12 movement classes with eight channels and did not find a statistical difference between electrode types. They concluded that the choice of electrode should be based not on classification accuracy but rather on signal consistency over time and robustness to electrode lift-off. Zia ur Rehman et al. (108) compared a standard linear discriminant analysis with a deep network for grasp classification. They performed a multiday analysis comparing six iEMG and six sEMG electrodes, and their results showed that deep learning had better decoding performance and was more stable over time.\n\nKamavuako et al. (109) investigated the effect of combining iEMG to target deep muscles with sEMG on myoelectric control. They showed that the combined solution improved offline and real-time control performance compared with sEMG alone.\n\nWith 32 iEMG electrodes, Dantas et al. (110) compared different decoding methods for the continuous control of five DOFs corresponding to the flexion and extension of each digit. Using a data set aggregation algorithm, they showed a normalized mean squared error as low as 0.033 with a deep convolutional neural network. They also investigated signal stability for 150 days after training, showing a small degradation during the first month (0.003 normalized mean squared error per day with a convolutional neural network), but that degradation stopped in the next four months.\n\nFor transradial amputees, an alternative to using EMG signals to control hand prostheses is decoding from peripheral nerve signals. Different grasp types can be decoded from peripheral nerve signals with high accuracy using different interfaces, both offline and in real time (54, 111113). Implanted peripheral nerve recordings are more invasive than sEMG but are more stable over time. Indeed, donning and doffing the prosthesis does not move these electrodes as much as it does sEMG electrodes. Recently, Cracchiolo et al. (53) decoded up to 11 class states using TIMEs on an amputee subject and showed that the active sites chosen on the first day could also be used in the following sessions, for up to seven days (80% accuracy, compared with 83% by selecting active sites every session). However, this modality is generally used to provide sensory\n\nfeedback (64, 114-116). Therefore the development of new approaches to record neural signals during peripheral stimulation [e.g., artifact removal (117)] is necessary.\n\nVu et al. (39) recently developed a regenerative peripheral nerve interface to increase signal specificity and long-term stability. They implanted transected peripheral nerves into a free muscle graft. After regeneration, revascularization, and reinnervation, the graft becomes a nerve bioamplifier that creates EMG signals. Using chronically implanted iEMG to record from these grafts, they performed five-class decoding in real time with up to 98.2% accuracy with two transradial amputees in a virtual hand environment. They also showed results from a Box and Block T est using an RPH that provided continuous control of two DOFs of thumb motions through their interface combined with a third DOF based on sEMG.\n", "topic": "The application of peripheral nerve recordings as an alternative to EMG for controlling prosthetic hands in transradial amputees, and the advantages of implanted versus non-implanted interfaces.", "question": "Considering the findings of Vu et al.

{"context": "## Transradial amputation:\nThe cosmetic solution is often used for the most distal amputations (e.g., fingers) but is not adapted for patients with a transradial amputation given the dramatic loss of functionality.

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n", "topic": "What are the primary limitations of body-powered mechanical hooks compared to body-powered hands in the context of transradial amputations?", "question": "What is the primary physiological reason for the substantially higher energy expenditure associated with body-powered mechanical hooks compared to body-powered hands in transradial amputations, as described in the text?", "choices": {"A": "The mechanical hooks utilize more complex and robust control systems, requiring greater power to maintain stability.", "B": "The inherent underactuation of hooks necessitates greater muscle contraction to achieve similar grasping movements compared to hands with multiple actuated degrees of freedom.", "C": "The design of mechanical hooks inherently relies on more powerful coil drivers due to their rigid structure and limited range of motion.", "D": "The passive DOFs in hooks require more significant shoulder movement to compensate for the lack of active control, increasing energy demand."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n", "topic": "The differences in performance and capabilities between Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrodes (TIMEs) and Longitudinal Intrafascicular Electrodes (LIFEs).", "question": "Considering the differing spatial reach and information inference capabilities of TIMEs and LIFEs, as described in the text, what is the primary rationale for TIMEs offering a greater ability to infer more comprehensive information from neural signals?", "choices": {"A": "TIMEs achieve superior signal inference due to their enhanced biocompatibility compared to LIFEs, promoting greater neural tissue integration.", "B": "TIMEs\u2019 transverse orientation allows them to access a proportionally larger segment of the nerve fascicle, facilitating broader signal capture.", "C": "LIFEs\u2019 longitudinal configuration inherently provides greater spatial resolution, resulting in more detailed signal interpretation.", "D": "TIMEs\u2019 smaller electrode size minimizes tissue disruption during implantation, leading to improved signal stability."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n", "topic": "Invasive electrode technologies, such as iEMG and intraneural electrodes, demonstrate improved stability but may not currently provide a sufficient performance gain to justify surgical intervention.", "question": "Considering the context\u2019s assessment that iEMG and intraneural electrodes offer improved stability but lack a sufficient performance advantage to justify surgical intervention, what is the most compelling rationale presented for *why* this limitation currently exists, beyond simply acknowledging the invasiveness of the procedures?", "choices": {"A": "The current generation of electrodes suffers from a lack of sophisticated algorithms capable of accurately interpreting nuanced motor intentions, leading to suboptimal control performance.", "B": "The primary constraint stems from the substantial power consumption associated with these implanted devices, restricting processing capabilities and ultimately limiting control precision.", "C": "The observed stability improvements are largely illusory, masking underlying issues with signal degradation and drift that compromise the reliability of decoding.", "D": "The lack of a decisive performance gain is primarily attributable to the relatively low computational resources available within the prosthetic system, hindering the deployment of more complex decoding models."}, "answer": "D", "explanation": "The correct answer (D) accurately reflects the context\u2019s discussion of power consumption, processing resources, and model complexity as key constraints limiting the performance of iEMG and intraneural electrodes.

{"context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n", "topic": "The factors influencing the stability of neural interfaces, including biocompatibility, electrode robustness, and electrode anchoring.", "question": "Considering the context, which of the following factors presents the MOST significant challenge to maintaining the long-term stability of neural interfaces, directly impacting the reliability of sensory feedback?", "choices": {"A": "The inherent limitations of surface electromyography (sEMG) in achieving high decoding accuracy across diverse motor tasks.", "B": "The geometric configuration and material properties of electrodes, influencing spatial discrimination of neural signals.", "C": "The stability of the electrode-tissue interface, encompassing biocompatibility, electrode robustness, and anchoring mechanisms.", "D": "The widespread adoption of implantable interfaces predicated on established surgical procedures."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \u201cSignificant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes [e.g., electrode coating] or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes\u2026 Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time.

{"context": "## 5.1. Sensors for Proprioception\nProprioception is not only fundamental for a dexterous hand prosthesis, enabling vision-free manipulation and multitasking, but is also the key to a properly embodied device (64). Usually, kinematic parameters of the robotic hand and (when available) the force exerted are needed to implement low-level control of the actuators, so they are measured with well-established systems, such as rotary encoders or the motor's current draw.\n\n\n## 5.2. Tactile Sensors\nDespite improvements in sensor miniaturization,computational power,and knowledge of the neurophysiology of somatosensation (tactile sensation and proprioception), the capabilities of sensorized RPHs remain far from those of a natural hand. Overcoming this limitation will require satisfying three conditions: The sensors must match the skin's sensing ability, a sufficient number of sensors must be embedded on the surface of the hand, and it must be possible to reliably read information from them. The first condition can be addressed with current technology, as the resolution of existing force and pressure sensors already matches human skin performance (120). However, fulfilling the second and third conditions is another matter, and we need to push the boundaries of circuit integration in order to create an RPH with many sensors and a way to communicate with them.\n\nThe classical solution of using general-purpose sensors developed separately from the signal conditioning circuit and the subsequent signal processing has shown its limit. Instead, efforts are being made to optimize these devices with prosthetics in mind. For example, borrowing the concept of morphological computation from robotics (121), sensors can be optimized for specific tasks by tuning the features of their mechanical structures accordingly. Indeed, exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination (61, 115). Another example comes from Kim et al. (122), who measured forces using sensors embedded in a soft substrate.\n\n)\n\nContinued\n\n(\n\n| Sensor distribution a                       |            |             |             |             |                  |              |                 |              |\n\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n\n| Interface                                   | G10 tactor | TIME        | TENS        | TIME        | FINE             | TIME         | Vibrators       | TENS         |\n\n| Electrical stimulation encoding Pulse width | -          | Fixed       | Linear      | Fixed       | Time variant     | Fixed        | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Amplitude                                   | -          | Linear      | Fixed       | Model based | Fixed            | Fixed        | -               | Fixed        |\n\n| Frequency                                   | -          | Fixed       | Fixed       | Model based | Linear           | Neuromorphic | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Mechanical stimulation encoding             | Linear     | -           | -           | -           | -                | -            | Discrete events | -            |\n\n| RPH model                                   | Passive    | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | SensorHand Speed | IH2 Azzurra  | Various         | bebionic     |\n\n| Reference                                   | 4          | 6           | 60          | 62          | 38               | 61           | 129             | 59           |\n\n| Year                                        | 2011       | 2014        | 2017        | 2018        | 2014             | 2016         | 2016            | 2018         |\n", "topic": "The use of compliant materials and textured surfaces to enhance tactile discrimination in RPH sensors.", "question": "Considering the utilization of compliant materials and textured surfaces as described in the text to enhance tactile discrimination, what fundamental principle underlies the observed improvement in texture detection?", "choices": {"A": "The increased sensor density directly correlates with enhanced signal resolution, surpassing the capabilities of human skin.", "B": "Exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of compliant materials reduces high-frequency noise, allowing for more precise differentiation of subtle textural variations.", "C": "Embedding sensors within a rigid substrate minimizes signal distortion, ensuring accurate force measurement independent of material compliance.", "D": "Neuromorphic encoding techniques, utilizing variable pulse widths and frequencies, directly stimulate mechanoreceptors to mimic human tactile perception."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \"exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination.\" Option B accurately reflects this mechanism.", "question_token_count": 32, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 23}
{"context": "## 6. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160). It assesses four basic movements: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movements of extension and flexion at the elbow and shoulder. Variously sized and shaped objects from daily living (a cup, a washer, etc.) are used for the test, which provides a broad overview of patients' improvement in the activity and impairment domains. Finally, the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure uses a set of abstract objects and activities of daily living with tasks specifically developed to assess the effectiveness of upper-limb prostheses (161).\n", "topic": "Examining motor dexterity using assessments like the Box and Block Test, Nine Hole Peg Test, and Clothespin Relocation Test.", "question": "Considering the limitations of relying solely on biological assessments, and acknowledging the importance of psychosocial reintegration, how does the Box and Block Test, as a measure of gross manual dexterity, contribute to evaluating the broader functional impact of a rehabilitation technology, specifically in relation to a patient's ability to participate in activities of daily living?", "choices": {"A": "The Box and Block Test primarily assesses the patient\u2019s strength, focusing on the force exerted during block movement, providing a direct measure of physical capacity.", "B": "While demonstrating gross motor skills, the Box and Block Test\u2019s assessment is limited to a single, isolated task and doesn\u2019t inherently reflect the patient\u2019s capacity for complex, real-world activities.", "C": "The test\u2019s focus on block transportation offers no insight into the patient's sensory feedback mechanisms, which are critical for dexterous motor tasks.", "D": "The test\u2019s normative data, when used with predefined block positions, allows for a comprehensive kinematic analysis, providing detailed insights into compensatory strategies."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states the Box and Block Test assesses \u201cunilateral gross manual dexterity,\u201d highlighting its focus on basic motor skills and not necessarily reflecting the nuanced complexity of real-world activities or the patient's ability to reintegrate into society.", "question_token_count": 64, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 8, "question_clarity_score": 7, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 31}
{"context": "## 2.1. Existing Robotic Prosthetic Hands\nNumerous commercially available RPH solutions use underactuated mechanisms ( Supplemental Table 1 ), including the Michelangelo prosthetic hand (Ottobock, Germany), the i-Limb Ultra (\u00d6ssur, Iceland), the bebionic hand (Ottobock), and the VINCENT evolution 3 (Vincent Systems, Germany). Despite remarkable advances, there is still arguably a trade-off between dexterity and weight in these solutions, with companies usually emphasizing one aspect or the other.\n\nMany research groups are currently working on innovative solutions to tackle the dexterity/ weight dilemma (19), such as the use of a monolithic 3D-printed soft material (20) or mechanical solutions to implement finger synergies via clutches (21). For example, Jing et al. (19) proposed an anthropomorphic RPH using only three motors that could achieve 13 grasp types while weighing only approximately 130 g.\n\nThe price of RPHs is an additional limiting factor for broader adoption by patients. With most advanced solutions costing $10,000-20,000, many researchers advocate for cheaper solutions, particularly for emerging countries (e.g., 22).\n\nOpen source RPHs are an exciting alternative to dramatically reduce the cost of development and distribution. One particularly interesting aspect of such hands is simplified maintenance and repairs (using, e.g., 3D printing) that do not rely on specific suppliers. For example, Open\n\nBionics (United Kingdom) commercializes solutions for transradial amputees (e.g., the medically certified Hero Arm) but also provides the source files for some of their designs, and e-NABLE ( https://enablingthefuture.org ) reports 8,000 recipients of their prosthetics, which were built by volunteers around the world. Open source RPHs also enable users to alter the design to meet their unique needs; for example, the Galileo Hand (23) allows easy customization of the types of movements and number of electromyography (EMG) electrodes.\n\nResearchers are also working on better mechanical solutions to improve RPH dexterity. An underactuated hand prosthesis designed by Abayasiri et al. (24) has finger abduction and adduction to enable it to grasp larger objects, and an adaptive prosthetic hand designed by Yong et al. (25) adds DOFs in the palm with movable metacarpals. The Karlsruhe Institute of T echnology (KIT) prosthetic hand (26) has an embedded camera and real-time object recognition, enabling the hand to be preshaped. Pneumatic artificial muscle (27) permits the development of light, compact solutions. Finally, biomimetic actuation is used for muscle-like actuators (15).\n\nIn addition to the hardware aspect, there are also innovations in RPH control and sensorization. Low-level controllers use information about the state of the device and eventually activate the actuation to meet the desired state imposed by the user's intentions. The choice of the state variable has a strong influence on how the device works. Position or speed can be read through encoders of each joint and controlled; these are straightforward approaches that have been used broadly in robotic applications. When the interaction of the hand with the external environment is of interest, more advanced control systems are implemented, such as torque or impedance control. Both approaches measure the force applied by the actuator, controlling it directly in the first case and simulating compliance in the second. Advanced control strategies enable complex manipulation and smoother gestures at the expense of a bulkier mechanical structure and a more complex control system. Therefore, enabling more sophisticated control requires integrated force and position sensors, which have been previously developed mainly to close the robotic control loop (28).\n\nIn summary, low-cost and light hands have flourished over the last few years. The race to simplify designs and reduce costs through 3D printing should not impact the dexterity of RPHs. For now, underactuated mechanisms are the best solution for RPHs and innovative designs based on synergy mechanisms or friction, the latter of which can help increase the number of DOAs without increasing the number of motors.\n", "topic": "The significance of open-source initiatives like Open Bionics and e-NABLE in democratizing access to robotic prosthetic technology.", "question": "Beyond the reduction in cost and facilitation of customization, what is the most critical strategic advantage conferred by open-source initiatives like Open Bionics and e-NABLE in the broader landscape of robotic prosthetic technology development?", "choices": {"A": "The reliance on readily available 3D printing technology for repairs and maintenance guarantees long-term usability and reduces dependence on specialized manufacturers.", "B": "The decentralized nature of design and production fosters a wider pool of innovation and adaptation to diverse user needs, surpassing the constraints of proprietary development cycles.", "C": "The lower initial investment encourages rapid prototyping and accelerated technological advancements, leading to quicker iterations of design and control systems.", "D": "The open-source licensing model inherently promotes rigorous testing and validation, ensuring a higher degree of reliability compared to commercially produced RPHs."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) highlights the core strategic advantage: the distributed and adaptive nature of open-source development, enabling a broader range of innovations and customization than traditional, proprietary approaches.

{"context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n", "topic": "Restoring both sensory and motor functions through a single intraneural surgery represents a promising, yet technologically challenging, future direction.", "question": "Considering the limitations of current RPH technologies \u2013 specifically, the need for recalibration in sEMG systems and the relatively modest performance gains of iEMG \u2013 what fundamental technological advancement would *most* convincingly justify a single intraneural surgery targeting both motor and sensory restoration?", "choices": {"A": "Improved algorithms for artifact removal in sEMG systems, reducing the frequency of recalibration.", "B": "Development of miniaturized, portable electronics capable of supporting complex decoding models with significantly reduced power consumption.", "C": "Concurrent, parallel recording of both discriminative motor signals and high-fidelity somatosensory feedback from intraneural electrodes, achieved without substantial latency.", "D": "Widespread adoption of cloud-based computing for real-time prosthesis control, eliminating the need for onboard processing resources."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer (C) directly addresses the core premise of the text \u2013 the potential of a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions simultaneously.

{"context": "## 5.4. Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n", "topic": "What is the significance of the Boston Arm in the development of position feedback for RPHs, and what limitations remain?", "question": "What was the primary contribution of the Boston Arm to the field of RPH sensory feedback, and what fundamental limitation of early position feedback systems did it specifically address?", "choices": {"A": "It demonstrated the feasibility of using visual cues for controlling myoelectric prostheses.", "B": "It established the necessity of position feedback for achieving precise reaching movements, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on tactile or kinesthetic sensations.", "C": "It pioneered the use of vibratory stimulation as a primary feedback modality in RPHs.", "D": "It facilitated the development of surgical interfaces for delivering sensory information to the residual limb."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n", "topic": "The evolution of RPH control strategies, from direct muscle contraction to pattern recognition, proportional control, and increasingly, deep learning approaches utilizing HD-sEMG.", "question": "Considering the evolution of RPH control strategies, specifically the shift towards deep learning utilizing HD-sEMG, what is the primary bottleneck hindering the widespread adoption of this approach, as highlighted in the text?", "choices": {"A": "The inherent limitations of traditional threshold-based detection methods, which are now being superseded by more sophisticated algorithms.", "B": "The requirement for extensive, labeled datasets for training deep neural networks, presenting a significant challenge given the difficulty of collecting sufficient data from individual users.", "C": "The structural similarity index, borrowed from computer vision, proving ineffective in decoding complex hand motions.", "D": "The reliance on anatomical knowledge for accurate electrode placement, leading to variability between subjects and hindering algorithm robustness."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n", "topic": "The role of surface electromyography (sEMG) and high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) in motor control, and their relative performance compared to implanted EMG.", "question": "Considering the comparative performance of surface electromyography (sEMG) and implanted EMG (iEMG) as detailed in the text, what fundamental limitation of sEMG technology directly contributes to the observed superior stability and continuous control capabilities demonstrated by iEMG?", "choices": {"A": "sEMG\u2019s reliance on a large number of electrodes for high-density recording (HD-sEMG) inherently leads to greater tissue disruption compared to iEMG\u2019s more localized stimulation.", "B": "sEMG\u2019s susceptibility to environmental noise and signal degradation necessitates more frequent recalibration, hindering its ability to provide continuous, stable control signals.", "C": "sEMG\u2019s inherent limitations in spatial discrimination and signal quality, stemming from electrode geometry and material properties, result in a less robust and stable neural interface compared to iEMG.", "D": "sEMG\u2019s surface-based nature limits its ability to maintain consistent contact with the underlying muscle tissue, leading to signal drift and instability over time."}, "answer": "D", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that \u201csignificant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes\u2026 to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces.\u201d This directly highlights the stability and continuous control advantages of iEMG due to its implantable nature and the ability to maintain consistent contact with neural tissue, contrasting with the limitations of sEMG's surface-based approach.", "question_token_count": 55, "answer_correctness_score": 8, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 34}
{"context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "The importance of incorporating sensorization and encoding strategies to provide somatosensory feedback to users of RPHs.", "question": "Considering the intricate neural representation of the hand and the need for intuitive control in robotic prosthetic hands, what is the primary benefit of implementing encoding strategies alongside RPH sensorization, as described in the context?", "choices": {"A": "To solely enhance the aesthetic appearance of the RPH, improving patient confidence.", "B": "To directly stimulate motor neurons, bypassing the need for sensory feedback and simplifying control algorithms.", "C": "To provide users with the perception of touch and force, facilitating more natural and precise manipulation.", "D": "To reduce the computational burden of the RPH control system by eliminating the need for complex sensory processing."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer is C.

{"context": "## 5. RESTORING SENSORY FEEDBACK\nSensory information plays a critical role in both the exploration of the external environment and in any manipulation task. When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface. Prec vious sections have described the different available interfaces; here, we present the encoding techniques and sensors relevant to the design of modern hand prostheses ( Table 1 ).\n\nSensors mounted on a robotic hand should ideally record the whole spectrum of available human sensations, from both external and internal sources. Indeed, sensory information from the human hand covers both interactions with the external world (tactile perception, thermal perception, and nociception, i.e., perception of pain) and internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles, together known as proprioception. Table 2 shows examples of sensor placements on RPHs from recent studies.\n", "topic": "How does the restoration of afferent sensory channels contribute to the embodiment of a hand prosthesis?", "question": "Restoring proprioceptive feedback from a hand prosthesis primarily contributes to which aspect of embodiment?", "choices": {"A": "Enhanced ability to detect external textures and temperatures.", "B": "A heightened awareness of the prosthesis\u2019s position and force exertion within the user\u2019s hand.", "C": "Improved discrimination of subtle variations in object size.", "D": "Increased sensitivity to painful stimuli encountered during use."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that proprioception encompasses \"internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles.\" This directly aligns with the definition of embodiment as the feeling of the prosthesis being an extension of the user's own body.", "question_token_count": 19, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 8, "avg_answer_token_count": 12}
{"context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n", "topic": "The trade-offs between electrode invasiveness and selectivity in neuromuscular interfaces, as described in the text.", "question": "Considering the established trade-off between electrode invasiveness and selectivity, what critical refinement to the conventional understanding of this relationship is suggested by recent research, specifically concerning the motor and sensory domains?", "choices": {"A": "Recent research indicates that the trade-off between invasiveness and selectivity is consistently linear across both motor and sensory neural interfaces.", "B": "Recent results suggest that the relationship between invasiveness and selectivity may differ significantly between motor and sensory neural interfaces, challenging the traditional view.", "C": "Recent studies have demonstrated that increasing electrode invasiveness invariably leads to a proportional increase in selectivity, regardless of the neural domain.", "D": "Recent research confirms that the primary driver of selectivity is electrode geometry, not invasiveness, across all neural interfaces."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \u201ctwo amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent results are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains.\u201d This directly supports option B.", "question_token_count": 37, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 7, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 25}

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n", "topic": "What factors contribute to the relatively high rejection rates of existing prosthetic solutions, as indicated by the cited survey data?", "question": "Considering the survey data and the operational characteristics of body-powered prostheses, what is the most compelling, granular explanation for the observed high rejection rates among patients?", "choices": {"A": "Patients reject body-powered prostheses primarily due to their limited aesthetic appeal, leading to a decreased sense of self-image.", "B": "The substantial energy expenditure required by body-powered systems, translating to frequent battery changes and reduced usability during daily activities, contributes significantly to patient dissatisfaction.", "C": "Patients consistently find body-powered prostheses too complex to operate effectively, requiring extensive training and ongoing maintenance.", "D": "The inherent proprioceptive feedback provided by body-powered systems is universally perceived as unpleasant and distracting by users."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "The role of algorithmic strategies in decoding motor intentions for seamless integration with robotic prosthetic hands.", "question": "Considering the described challenges in developing robotic prosthetic hands, what is the most critical limitation addressed by incorporating advanced algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, beyond simply enhancing dexterity?", "choices": {"A": "Ensuring the prosthetic hand\u2019s aesthetic appearance aligns with patient preferences.", "B": "Mitigating the physical strain on the amputee\u2019s remaining limb during operation.", "C": "Accurately translating the user\u2019s intended movements into coordinated robotic actions, accounting for variations in neural signal quality and motor control.", "D": "Reducing the overall cost of the neuroprosthetic device through simplified algorithmic design."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The correct answer (C) directly addresses the core challenge outlined in the text \u2013 the need to translate motor intentions into robotic action.

{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers. Sensory remapping (65) can be another viable solution to simulate temperature feedback on a different part of the body using a temperature display.\n", "topic": "What is the rationale behind using sensory remapping as a potential workaround for temperature feedback limitations?", "question": "What is the primary rationale for employing sensory remapping as a proposed solution to temperature feedback limitations, as described in the context?", "choices": {"A": "To directly stimulate A \u03b4 and C fibers with advanced electrode technology.", "B": "To bypass the limitations of existing electrodes by delivering temperature feedback to a non-adjacent body region via a temperature display.", "C": "To utilize sEMG signals for inferring temperature information due to the motor domain\u2019s advantages.", "D": "To combine intraneural stimulation with homologous tactile feedback for temperature sensation."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer is B.

{"context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n", "topic": "The potential of combining HD-sEMG with deep learning and domain adaptation to achieve unprecedented performance in motor intention decoding, improving robustness and reducing training requirements.", "question": "Considering the challenges of acquiring sufficient labeled data for deep learning-based motor intention decoding, particularly in the context of HD-sEMG and inter-user variability, what is the primary rationale for employing domain adaptation techniques, as described in the text?", "choices": {"A": "Domain adaptation allows for the direct transfer of a pre-trained deep learning model to a new user without any further training, bypassing the need for extensive data collection.", "B": "Domain adaptation leverages data from multiple subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user, effectively mitigating the limitations of small datasets by generalizing learned representations.", "C": "Domain adaptation focuses solely on improving the spatial resolution of HD-sEMG signals, enhancing the accuracy of electrode placement.", "D": "Domain adaptation utilizes structural similarity indices to classify wrist and hand motions, offering a more robust alternative to traditional feature extraction methods."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that domain adaptation \u201cleverages data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user.\u201d This directly addresses the problem of limited data availability for deep learning models.", "question_token_count": 48, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 28}
{"context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n", "topic": "The trade-offs between dexterity, robustness, and usability in the design of wearable and intuitive robotic prosthetic hands.", "question": "Considering the inherent trade-offs outlined in the text, if a robotic prosthetic hand is designed to maximize dexterity, what is the most likely consequence regarding its robustness and usability?", "choices": {"A": "Increased robustness and improved usability would be guaranteed.", "B": "A reduction in robustness and a decrease in usability are inevitable.", "C": "The impact on robustness and usability would be unpredictable and potentially detrimental.", "D": "Dexterity and robustness would increase, while usability would remain unchanged."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that designing for high dexterity often necessitates a compromise, leading to a reduction in robustness and usability.

{"context": "## 5.4. Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n", "topic": "How do precision, synchronicity, somatotopy, and modality contribute to the effectiveness of sensory feedback in RPHs?", "question": "Considering the constraints of mechanical stimulation and the need for precise control in RPHs, how does the deliberate manipulation of somatotopic feedback \u2013 specifically, targeting distinct areas of the residual limb \u2013 impact the overall effectiveness of sensory feedback compared to a uniformly distributed stimulation pattern?", "choices": {"A": "Somatotopic feedback consistently yields superior precision due to the direct mapping of stimulation to specific motor targets.", "B": "Uniform stimulation provides a more reliable and predictable sensory experience, outweighing any potential limitations related to mechanical delays.", "C": "The effectiveness of feedback is primarily determined by synchronicity, rendering somatotopic variations largely inconsequential.", "D": "Somatotopic feedback introduces variability and potential for misinterpretation, diminishing the overall reliability of sensory information."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The text emphasizes the importance of aligning evoked sensations with desired ones, including position (somatotopy).

{"context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n", "topic": "Explain the concept of electrotactile feedback and outline its primary drawbacks as described in the text.", "question": "According to the text, what are the two primary drawbacks associated with electrotactile feedback?", "choices": {"A": "The dependence of sensory thresholds on stimulation position necessitating recalibration and the introduction of significant artifacts in electromyography (EMG) readings.", "B": "The limited spatial precision of evoked sensations compared to invasive neural stimulation and the requirement for complex biomimetic stimulation patterns.", "C": "The difficulty of achieving long-term implant stability and the inability to evoke sensations intuitive for the user.", "D": "The high cost of developing peripheral nervous system interfaces and the lack of clinical validation for spinal cord stimulation techniques."}, "answer": "A", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \"The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\"", "question_token_count": 20, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 24}
{"context": "## 3.2. Perspectives\nThe challenges for future interfaces that can provide the necessary read/write bandwidth to use RPHs in a natural fashion are immense. We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers. Sensory remapping (65) can be another viable solution to simulate temperature feedback on a different part of the body using a temperature display.\n", "topic": "How does the size of sensory fibers, specifically C fibers, impact the feasibility of direct temperature stimulation via implantable electrodes?", "question": "Considering the size disparity between C fibers and current implantable electrode technology, what represents the primary obstacle to direct temperature stimulation via these electrodes?", "choices": {"A": "The limited bandwidth of RPH hardware.", "B": "The inherent difficulty in achieving sufficient signal-to-noise ratio with non-invasive stimulation.", "C": "The exceptionally small diameter of C fibers, rendering them inaccessible to existing electrode geometries.", "D": "The potential for immune rejection of implanted electrodes."}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "The text explicitly states, \"Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes.\"", "question_token_count": 28, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 7, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 13}
{"context": "## Transradial amputation:\nThe cosmetic solution is often used for the most distal amputations (e.g., fingers) but is not adapted for patients with a transradial amputation given the dramatic loss of functionality.

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n", "topic": "What is the significance of the DOA/DOF ratio in relation to prosthetic hand design and control?", "question": "In the context of robotic prosthetic hand design, what is the primary rationale for utilizing a DOA/DOF ratio less than 1, and how does this strategy influence the achievable dexterity of the device?", "choices": {"A": "A DOA/DOF ratio less than 1 inherently increases the required motor power to achieve a specific grasp, prioritizing robustness over dexterity.", "B": "An underactuated system leverages passive DOFs to adapt to the contact surface, reducing the number of actuators needed and simplifying the mechanical design, albeit potentially limiting dexterity.", "C": "A DOA/DOF ratio less than 1 necessitates the inclusion of redundant actuators to compensate for the reduced degrees of actuation, enhancing overall dexterity.", "D": "The DOA/DOF ratio directly correlates with the size and weight of the prosthetic hand, with lower ratios resulting in more compact designs and improved dexterity."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) accurately describes the rationale behind using a DOA/DOF ratio less than 1 \u2013 it utilizes passive DOFs for adaptation and reduces the number of actuators, simplifying the design while acknowledging potential dexterity limitations.

( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n", "topic": "Measurement of Grasping Ability and Force Control", "question": "Considering the described assessments of grasping ability and force control, what specific physiological mechanism, as suggested by Thumser et al., directly links the difficulty of a grasping task to its outcome, and how does this relate to the challenges in evaluating RPHs with sensory feedback?", "choices": {"A": "The difficulty of a grasping task is determined solely by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size, as described by Fitts' law.", "B": "Grasping difficulty is primarily influenced by the object\u2019s weight and hardness, as measured by the ratio of these two properties, analogous to reaching a small target.", "C": "Grasping difficulty is determined by the subject's cognitive load, as evidenced by event-related potentials during human-machine interactions.", "D": "The difficulty of grasping is directly proportional to the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to an auditory stimulus, indicating the attention allocated to the primary task."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) accurately reflects Thumser et al.\u2019s argument that grasping difficulty is related to the ratio of object weight to hardness, mirroring the principle of Fitts' law applied to reaching tasks.

{"context": "## 5. RESTORING SENSORY FEEDBACK\nSensory information plays a critical role in both the exploration of the external environment and in any manipulation task. When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface. Prec vious sections have described the different available interfaces; here, we present the encoding techniques and sensors relevant to the design of modern hand prostheses ( Table 1 ).\n\nSensors mounted on a robotic hand should ideally record the whole spectrum of available human sensations, from both external and internal sources. Indeed, sensory information from the human hand covers both interactions with the external world (tactile perception, thermal perception, and nociception, i.e., perception of pain) and internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles, together known as proprioception.

{"context": "## Transradial amputation:\nThe cosmetic solution is often used for the most distal amputations (e.g., fingers) but is not adapted for patients with a transradial amputation given the dramatic loss of functionality.

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n", "topic": "How does the concept of underactuation contribute to the complexity and design considerations of myoelectric prosthetic hands?", "question": "Considering the described approach to reducing complexity in RPH design through underactuation, what is the primary biomechanical mechanism leveraged to enable adaptive grip behavior within an underactuated system, as highlighted by the concept of morphological computation?", "choices": {"A": "Employing redundant actuators to precisely control each finger joint independently, maximizing dexterity.", "B": "Utilizing passive degrees of freedom to conform to the shape of the grasped object, eliminating the need for active control of those joints.", "C": "Implementing feedback loops to continuously monitor surface contact and adjust actuator forces in real-time.", "D": "Prioritizing miniaturization of actuators to reduce weight and power consumption, sacrificing some degree of grip adaptability."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) directly aligns with the text\u2019s description of morphological computation \u2013 exploiting passive DOFs for self-adjusting grips.

{"context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n", "topic": "The application of domain adaptation (transfer learning) techniques, particularly deep domain adaptation, to overcome the limitations of small training datasets by leveraging data from multiple users.", "question": "Considering the challenges of acquiring sufficient labeled EMG data for individual users in robotic hand control, how does the proposed application of deep domain adaptation address the limitations of relying solely on data from a single subject?", "choices": {"A": "Deep domain adaptation eliminates the need for labeled data by directly training a model on raw EMG signals.", "B": "Deep domain adaptation leverages data from multiple users to learn a general representation of EMG patterns, enabling effective training with limited data from a new user.", "C": "Deep domain adaptation focuses exclusively on improving the signal processing techniques, rather than addressing the data scarcity issue.", "D": "Deep domain adaptation relies on unsupervised learning methods, ignoring the need for any labeled data from multiple users."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer (B) accurately reflects the core principle of domain adaptation as described in the text \u2013 utilizing data from multiple users to create a transferable model for new users.", "question_token_count": 41, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 23}
