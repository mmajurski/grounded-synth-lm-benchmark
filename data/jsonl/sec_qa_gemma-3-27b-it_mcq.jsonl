It is easy to understand,\n\ncompute, and trivial to crack. Let's create a table that maps every letter in the alphabet to a different letter:\n\n:::: table\n\n::: content\n\n| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   | I   | J   | K   | L   | M   | N   | O   | P   | Q   | R   | S   | T   | U   | V   | W   | X   | Y   | Z   |\n\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n\n| J   | G   | T   | Q   | X   | Y   | A   | U   | C   | R   | V   | I   | F   | H   | O   | K   | L   | E   | D   | B   | W   | S   | Z   | M   | N   | P   |\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nNow creating a message is simple a matter of performing the substitutions. For example, `HELLO WORLD`{.literal} becomes\n\n`UXIIO ZOEIQ`{.literal}.\n\nWhile this is simple to understand and set up, it is also very easy to break. You could use a frequency attack, where\n\nyou analyze a large chunk of encrypted text knowing that certain letters are more frequent than others. By matching up\n\nthe most frequently used ciphertext letters with their standard English equivalents you may quickly reach a solution.\n\nYou could also go through all permutations of the alphabet (4E26) and see what gives you the most English words. The\n\nsecond attack is made much more feasible through computing.\n\n:::::\n\n:::::::\n\n:::::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.3.

ICMP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__icmp}\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is largely used to send messages between systems when IP doesn't work. For\n\nexample, lets say we tried to connect to a host but our router doesn't know how to get there. Our router can send us an\n\nICMP *Destination Unreachable* message to let us know that something is going wrong. Because ICMP messages work at the\n\nnetwork layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue with the internet layer.\n\nThe most common use for ICMP is the `ping`{.literal} command. `ping`{.literal} sends an ICMP echo request to check to\n\nsee if a host is up.

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).

{"context": "## 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\".

It is easy to understand,\n\ncompute, and trivial to crack. Let's create a table that maps every letter in the alphabet to a different letter:\n\n:::: table\n\n::: content\n\n| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   | I   | J   | K   | L   | M   | N   | O   | P   | Q   | R   | S   | T   | U   | V   | W   | X   | Y   | Z   |\n\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n\n| J   | G   | T   | Q   | X   | Y   | A   | U   | C   | R   | V   | I   | F   | H   | O   | K   | L   | E   | D   | B   | W   | S   | Z   | M   | N   | P   |\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nNow creating a message is simple a matter of performing the substitutions.

{"context": "## 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed. These tables may take up terabytes of disk space, but can make cracking even complicated hashes much simpler.\n\n<p>\n\nLet's use a custom utility named\n\n<code class=\"literal\">\n\n[\\`crypt`</code>`{=html}](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/blob/main/labs/hash/crypt.c){.link} to show that we have the\n\nactual password. This utility is already installed on your container. We will start by printing out just the line in\n\n`/etc/shadow`{.literal} that has karl's info. We will use the `grep`{.literal} command to limit out output to things\n\nthat have `karl`{.literal} in them:\n\n</p>\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@7f978dd90746:/# cat /etc/shadow | grep karl\n\nkarl:$y$j9T$oR2ZofMTuH3dpEGbw6c/y.$TwfvHgCl4sIp0b28YTepJ3YVvl/3UyWKeLCmDV1tAd9:19255:0:99999:7:::</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe first part of the shadow line is the username, karl. The next part of the shadown line, immediately following the\n\nfirst colon, is the hash information. The characters in between the first set of `$`{.literal} is the version of the\n\nhashing algorithm being used, `y`{.literal} for yescrypt in our case. The characters in between the second set of\n\n`$`{.literal} are the parameters passed to yescrypt which will always be `j9T`{.literal} for us. The characters in\n\nbetween the third set of `$`{.literal} is your salt. Finally the characters in between the fourth set of `$`{.literal}\n\nis the hash.\n\nThe \\[`crypt`{.literal}\\] utility calls the system\n\n[`crypt`{.literal}](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/crypt.3.html){.link} command and prints the output.

DNS is a\n\ndistributed system by design and is used for resolving domain names into IP addresses. Due to the distributed nature of\n\nthe system, protocols were built in for having a single domain served by multiple servers. These servers pass\n\ninformation to each other using a DNS zone transfer.\n\nTypically these communications should be internal as they may leak valuable information regarding the zone.\n\nUnfortunately an improperly configured DNS server may advertise its zone transfers publicly.

Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data.

Digital Certificates {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__digital_certificates}\nA digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company or an individual. Since asymmetric encryption\n\nrequires know a party's public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of the owner. The question\n\nthen becomes how do you trust that the public key is *actually* for the alleged owner? That's where the issuing\n\nauthority comes in. A *certificate authority (CA)* signs the certificate indicating that the ID and public_key are\n\ncorrect. Certificates can be self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often only used in\n\ntesting. Since most certificates are used for encrypting web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is\n\nusing a self-signed certificate.\n\nGiven how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not\n\nissues by root CAs, but are actually issued by intermediate CAs. Root CAs delegate the work to Intermediate CAs and\n\nindicate their trust in them by signing the intermediate CAs keys. This creates a *chain of trust* from the issued\n\ncertificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA (signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by\n\nthe browser). Tools that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and update them from the companies\n\nthat issue them as needed.\n\nThe certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact with it is often possible to install root CAs\n\nmanually. [This is can be used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for\n\ndebugging](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert){.link} or for more nefarious\n\npurposes. For this reason some applications, Facebook mobiles apps for example, maintain their own certificate store and\n\nprevent users from adding root CAs to it.\n\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/letsencrypt.svg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"letsencrypt\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSo how do you get a certificate for your website? The customer will generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that\n\nincludes the public key and their ID. The CA will validate that the customer owns the website and build and sign the\n\ncert. This whole process can be automated and performed for free via a tool called [Let's\n\nEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){.link}.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"2.10.6.

Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

Business Continuity {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__business_continuity}\nThe concept of continuity is central to the steps taken to respond to an incident. Remember that the goal is to keep\n\nthings running and keep services available. Business Continuity has three main parts: Business Continuity Planning\n\n(BCP), Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP).\n\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) is a methodology for keeping things running. With BCP threats are identified in\n\nadvance and critical business processes are prioritized. Recovery procedures for these processes have been developed and\n\ntested. In response to an incident, these procedures are followed as practiced.\n\nBusiness Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies business functions and rates the impact of an outage on these functions. BIA\n\nmeasures the impact of an outage on:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Property (tangible assets)]{.principal}\n\n- [Finance (monetary funding)]{.principal}\n\n- [Safety (physical protection)]{.principal}\n\n- [Reputation (status)]{.principal}\n\n- [Life (well being)]{.principal}\n\n- [Customers]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nBIA can help pinpoint mission-essential functions and single points of failure. This allows SOCs to determine where\n\nthere resources should go in terms of having the best chance of maintaining business continuity.\n\nFinally having a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) makes it easier to recover in the case of a large-scale issue. Disaster\n\nRecovery (DR) entails policies, tools, and procedures to recover from an outage. DRPs will detail order of restoration\n\nand require a lot of testing to ensure that the entire suite of supported applications can be brought back up.

It is easy to understand,\n\ncompute, and trivial to crack. Let's create a table that maps every letter in the alphabet to a different letter:\n\n:::: table\n\n::: content\n\n| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   | I   | J   | K   | L   | M   | N   | O   | P   | Q   | R   | S   | T   | U   | V   | W   | X   | Y   | Z   |\n\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n\n| J   | G   | T   | Q   | X   | Y   | A   | U   | C   | R   | V   | I   | F   | H   | O   | K   | L   | E   | D   | B   | W   | S   | Z   | M   | N   | P   |\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nNow creating a message is simple a matter of performing the substitutions. For example, `HELLO WORLD`{.literal} becomes\n\n`UXIIO ZOEIQ`{.literal}.\n\nWhile this is simple to understand and set up, it is also very easy to break. You could use a frequency attack, where\n\nyou analyze a large chunk of encrypted text knowing that certain letters are more frequent than others. By matching up\n\nthe most frequently used ciphertext letters with their standard English equivalents you may quickly reach a solution.\n\nYou could also go through all permutations of the alphabet (4E26) and see what gives you the most English words. The\n\nsecond attack is made much more feasible through computing.\n\n:::::\n\n:::::::\n\n:::::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.3.

In casual conversation we may assume that\n\n    *authorization* is a foregone conclusion once an actor has progressed this far, but in actuality authorization\n\n    relies on the previous steps being completed and may in fact fail.

Proxies and receive and send requests on behalf of a\n\nuser, allowing for full control over the traffic going out and coming back in.\n\nProxies can be used for caching, access control, URL filtering, content scanning, and even packet inspection. Proxy\n\nsolutions may be explicit or transparent and are offered by many companies including McAfee, Fortigate, Netsparker, and\n\nPalo Alto. A typical application of a proxy would be to filter explicit content on a school district network.\n\nProxies can also be broken into *forward* and *reverse* configurations. A forward proxy passes requests from a private\n\nor internal network to the internet. Forward proxies can speed up local requests through caching and validate that the\n\nrequest should be performed. Forward proxies are interoperable with standard firewalls and network address translation\n\n(NAT).\n\nReverse proxies take requests from an external source and pass it to an internal service. This helps prevent clients\n\nfrom having direct access to internal services. Reverse proxies can utilize caching and validate requests as well. A\n\nreverse proxy can also be configured to work with a firewall. Whereas it used to be common practice to place a server in\n\na demilitarized zone (DMZ) outside of a firewall, it is now far more common to employ a reverse proxy to reach that\n\nserver.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.3.

Mathematical Foundation {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mathematical_foundation}\nCryptography relies largely on the concept of one-way or trap door functions. That is a process that is hard to compute\n\nin one direction, but easy to compute in the other. For example it is much easier for a computer to multiply large\n\nnumbers than to determine the factors of large numbers. This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm. [A simplified\n\nversion of the algorithm](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jpopyack/IntroCS/HW/RSAWorksheet.html){.link} is shown below:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>KEY GENERATION\n\np = a random prime number\n\nq = a random prime number\n\nN = p * q\n\nr = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\n\nK = a number which equals one when modded by r and can be factored\n\ne = a factor of K that doesn&#39;t share factors with N\n\nd = another factor of K that doesn&#39;t share factors with N\n\nYour public key is N and e\n\nYour private key is N and d\n\nENCRYPTION\n\nciphertext = (cleartext**e)%N\n\nDECRYPTION\n\ncleartext = (ciphertext**d)%N\n\nEXAMPLE\n\np = 7\n\nq = 13\n\nN = 7 * 13 = 91\n\nr = 72\n\nK = 145 (because 145%72 = 1)\n\ne = 5\n\nd = 29\n\nPublic Key = 91, 5\n\nPrivate Key = 91, 29\n\ncleartext = 72 (&#39;H&#39; in ASCII)\n\nciphertext = (72**5)%91 = 11 (encrypted using N and e)\n\ncleartext = (11**29)%91 = 72 (decrypted using N and d)</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn order to *crack* RSA you would need to be able to factor N into its two prime numbers.

You'll notice that the algorithm only requires exponentiation, multiplication, and\n\nmodulus arithmetic. At no point do you ever have to factor a large prime number to generate keys, encrypt, or decrypt.\n\nYou only have to perform that operation if you're trying to work backwards without the keys.\n\nOther similar one-way function exist based on elliptical curves. It turns out that motion along an elliptical curve can\n\nbe described according to a start and end point and several iterations of a simple algorithm. You can reconstruct the\n\ninitial conditions if you know the start point, end point, and how many iterations it took. If all you know is the start\n\nand end point you can't determine the initial conditions.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.5.

{"context": "### 7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}\nThere are several different authorization models that can be used. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

{"context": "## Remote Shells\n::: content\n\nAs you have hopefully experienced by completing the labs, Linux systems traditionally have a powerful shell system that\n\nuses text commands to control the OS. Through the shell you can create, read, update, or delete files, make network\n\nconnections, configure kernel parameters, install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells that\n\ncan be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an\n\nattacker would need to have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is being able to interact\n\nwith a shell remotely on the exploited machine.\n\nIn this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect. In these instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out\n\nfrom the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the inside*. This is more compatible with the\n\nfirewalls/NAT routers that sit between most devices and the Internet.\n\nIn either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote connection allows an attacker to basically do\n\nanything they want. To that end, many tools have sprung up to provide remote shell access. A machine may already have a\n\nremote shell tool installed, such as an SSH server. Barring that [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/){.link} can be\n\nused with any executable to provide access to it over a network. [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/){.link} (a\n\nvery popular pentesting framework) comes with many payloads, most of which are shells of various types.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

That is a process that is hard to compute\n\nin one direction, but easy to compute in the other. For example it is much easier for a computer to multiply large\n\nnumbers than to determine the factors of large numbers. This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm. [A simplified\n\nversion of the algorithm](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jpopyack/IntroCS/HW/RSAWorksheet.html){.link} is shown below:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>KEY GENERATION\n\np = a random prime number\n\nq = a random prime number\n\nN = p * q\n\nr = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\n\nK = a number which equals one when modded by r and can be factored\n\ne = a factor of K that doesn&#39;t share factors with N\n\nd = another factor of K that doesn&#39;t share factors with N\n\nYour public key is N and e\n\nYour private key is N and d\n\nENCRYPTION\n\nciphertext = (cleartext**e)%N\n\nDECRYPTION\n\ncleartext = (ciphertext**d)%N\n\nEXAMPLE\n\np = 7\n\nq = 13\n\nN = 7 * 13 = 91\n\nr = 72\n\nK = 145 (because 145%72 = 1)\n\ne = 5\n\nd = 29\n\nPublic Key = 91, 5\n\nPrivate Key = 91, 29\n\ncleartext = 72 (&#39;H&#39; in ASCII)\n\nciphertext = (72**5)%91 = 11 (encrypted using N and e)\n\ncleartext = (11**29)%91 = 72 (decrypted using N and d)</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn order to *crack* RSA you would need to be able to factor N into its two prime numbers.

You'll notice that the algorithm only requires exponentiation, multiplication, and\n\nmodulus arithmetic. At no point do you ever have to factor a large prime number to generate keys, encrypt, or decrypt.\n\nYou only have to perform that operation if you're trying to work backwards without the keys.\n\nOther similar one-way function exist based on elliptical curves. It turns out that motion along an elliptical curve can\n\nbe described according to a start and end point and several iterations of a simple algorithm. You can reconstruct the\n\ninitial conditions if you know the start point, end point, and how many iterations it took. If all you know is the start\n\nand end point you can't determine the initial conditions.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.5.

Backups make recovery much simpler and\n\ncompanies that do not have a backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That being said, malware\n\nmay have also found its way into the backups if given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically\n\ndestroyed and a new one is built.
