Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.\n\nOf the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement therapy despite achieving long-term remission.

There were three conditions: unprocessed, and at frequency compression ratios of 2:1 and 3:1 (cut-off frequency, 1.6 kHz). Working memory and cognitive ability were measured using the reading span test and the trail making test, respectively.\n\nParticipants were 15 young normally-hearing adults with normal cognition.\n\nThere was a statistically significant reduction in mean speech recognition from around 80% when unprocessed to 40% for 2:1 compression and 30% for 3:1 compression. There was a statistically significant relationship between speech recognition and cognition for the unprocessed condition but not for the frequency-compressed conditions.\n\n", "topic": "The relationship between cognitive abilities (working memory and general cognition) and speech recognition performance.", "question": "How does the presence of frequency compression in speech signals affect the relationship between cognitive abilities (working memory and general cognition) and speech recognition performance, and what might this imply about the cognitive processing of distorted versus unprocessed auditory input?", "answer": "Frequency compression disrupts the correlation between cognitive abilities and speech recognition, implying cognitive processing supports recognition of natural speech but is less effective for distorted signals.", "explanation": "The study found a significant correlation between cognition and speech recognition only for unprocessed speech, not for frequency-compressed speech, indicating that cognitive abilities support speech recognition when the auditory signal is natural but are less predictive when the signal is acoustically altered, suggesting that cognitive compensation has limits in processing distorted auditory input.", "question_token_count": 46, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 7, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 30, "choices": null}
