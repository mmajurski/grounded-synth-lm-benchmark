Lab: Malicious Containers {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_malicious_containers}\nWhile containers have made it much easier to deploy software, they have also made it easier to deploy *malicious*\n\nsoftware. Imagine that we have an internal company website, written in PHP and deployed in a Docker container. Given the\n\nlayered nature of the Docker build system, this application is *trusting* that the images it is building from are\n\nsecure. Take a look at the following `Dockerfile`{.literal} to see just how easy it is to slip something malicious into\n\nthe image:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>FROM php:apache\n\nCOPY shell.php /var/www/html/shell.php\n\nCOPY index.php /var/www/html/index.php</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n`shell.php`{.literal} is a shell written in PHP that will execute with the permissions of the web server. This means it\n\nwill be able to read and write (but not overwrite) in the /var/www/html directory.\n\nLet's download, build, and run this image. Download [the malicious.zip\n\nfile](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/malicious.zip){.link}, unzip it in a directory where you have write\n\naccess, and navigate to that directory in your shell.\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>PS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\malicious&gt; docker build -t malicious . \u2460\n\n[+] Building 32.4s (8/8) FINISHED\n\n =&gt; [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                                                                                                                                        0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring dockerfile: 134B                                                                                                                                                                        0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load .dockerignore                                                                                                                                                                           0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring context: 2B                                                                                                                                                                             0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/php:apache                                                                                                                                              32.2s\n\n =&gt; [1/3] FROM docker.io/library/php:apache@sha256:f1c5dba2a2981f91ec31b9596d4165acd0b46e58382e47622487e130a21e420d                                                                                         0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load build context                                                                                                                                                                           0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring context: 61B                                                                                                                                                                            0.0s\n\n =&gt; CACHED [2/3] COPY shell.php /var/www/html/shell.php                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; CACHED [3/3] COPY index.php /var/www/html/index.php                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; exporting to image                                                                                                                                                                                      0.1s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; exporting layers                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; writing image sha256:e1dc75a91b2e269091069b1e3406a496b4bbfd95b066f970062ea8b3a74d8368                                                                                                                0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; naming to docker.io/library/malicious                                                                                                                                                                0.0s\n\nPS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\malicious&gt; docker run -p 8080:80 malicious \u2461\n\nAH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server&#39;s fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.2.

{"context": "### 7.3.9. Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.  [User accesses a sevice]{.principal}\n\n2.  [User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request]{.principal}\n\n3.  [User logs in]{.principal}\n\n4.  [Credentials are verified]{.principal}\n\n5.  [SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one. The following diagram\n\nhighlights the differences between OpenID authentication and an OAuth flow:\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/oauth.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"oauth\" />\n\n</div>\n\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">OpenID vs. Pseudo-Authentication using OAuth</a> by <a\n\nhref=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\" class=\"link\">Perhelion</a>\n\nused under <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">CC0 1.0</a></figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.10.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

While individual controls may provide multiple parts, it is still important to\n\nunderstand what each part represents:\n\n::: description-list\n\n[Identification]{.term}\n\n:   [The act of identifying an actor or *something* that is used to identify an actor. This could be as simple as a\n\n    drivers license or as complex as a cryptographic signature that can only be made by the bearer of a private key.\n\n    Example: A delivery driver presenting an employee badge.]{.principal}\n\n[Authentication]{.term}\n\n:   [This step occurs when an identity is confirmed through the use of a specific process. This could be the process\n\n    through which the private key is used or perhaps another biometric process such as reading a fingerprint. In either\n\n    case the *authentication* is the method by which we verify identity. Example: Examining the delivery driver's\n\n    badge.]{.principal}\n\n[Authorization]{.term}\n\n:   [Authorization is when an actor is given permission to access a resource. In casual conversation we may assume that\n\n    *authorization* is a foregone conclusion once an actor has progressed this far, but in actuality authorization\n\n    relies on the previous steps being completed and may in fact fail. A system may have identified who someone was\n\n    through authentication with a username and password, but that user is not set up to have access to a resource. In\n\n    this case the *authorization* step would fail. To continue with our delivery driver example: Allowing the delivery\n\n    driver to pick up a package.]{.principal}\n\n[Accounting]{.term}\n\n:   [Finally accounting is the process through which a record of access to the resource is recorded. Accounting may be a\n\n    log of users who have signed in an log of what resources they each accessed.

These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure. While a backup does not solve the problem of the data being\n\n    sold or used by others, it does allow for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a security\n\n    plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Encryption]{.term}\n\n:   [At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to make it useful. Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key. Often,\n\n    encryption and backups complement each other and fill in the use cases that each lacks individually.

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself.

Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n", "topic": "Understanding the concept of tokenization and its role in protecting sensitive information in access control schemes.", "question": "What primary benefit does tokenization offer in access control schemes for protecting sensitive information like credit card numbers?", "choices": {"A": "It encrypts the information.", "B": "It replaces sensitive information with a unique, non-sensitive token.", "C": "It sets up multi-factor authentication.", "D": "It creates a firewall to block unauthorized access."}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "Tokenization is a security method that substitutes sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens, making it a primary benefit for protecting sensitive information like credit card numbers.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

IP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ip}\nIP stands for internet protocol and it was devised to allow creating a network of networks. The network of networks that\n\nuses it primarily is the Internet, although you could use IP in other scenarios as well. IP is largely concerned with\n\n*routing* traffic across and to networks. The protocol was first detailed by the IEEE in 1974 and comes from the\n\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) project, which created the first large, packet-switched network.\n\nMost people are familiar with IP addresses, the unique number given to a host participating in an IP network.

For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China.

IP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ip}\nIP stands for internet protocol and it was devised to allow creating a network of networks. The network of networks that\n\nuses it primarily is the Internet, although you could use IP in other scenarios as well. IP is largely concerned with\n\n*routing* traffic across and to networks. The protocol was first detailed by the IEEE in 1974 and comes from the\n\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) project, which created the first large, packet-switched network.\n\nMost people are familiar with IP addresses, the unique number given to a host participating in an IP network. Currently\n\nthere are two main versions of the IP protocol, IPv4 and IPv6, and one of the major differences is in how many IP\n\naddresses are available. IPv4 supports 32 bit addresses and IPv6 supports 128 bit addresses. To give an idea of how big\n\nof a change that is, we have currently allocated all possible IPv4 addresses, but with IPv6 we could give an address to\n\nevery grain of sand on the beaches of earth and still not run out.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"IPv6 Security Implications\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n", "topic": "The potential applications and benefits of IPv6, including its ability to provide a unique address to every device on a network and its impact on Internet of Things (IoT) development.", "question": "What significant advantage does IPv6 offer over IPv4 in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) development, and how could this impact the future scalability and security of IoT networks?", "choices": {"A": "Improved network latency and faster data transfer rates", "B": "Enhanced device security through encryption", "C": "Virtually unlimited address space, enabling unique identification and management of a vast number of devices", "D": "Simplified network configuration and reduced maintenance needs"}, "answer": "C", "explanation": "IPv6's 128-bit address space provides a virtually unlimited number of unique IP addresses, which is crucial for IoT development where millions of devices are interconnected.

{"context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1.

[SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one. The following diagram\n\nhighlights the differences between OpenID authentication and an OAuth flow:\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/oauth.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"oauth\" />\n\n</div>\n\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">OpenID vs. Pseudo-Authentication using OAuth</a> by <a\n\nhref=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\" class=\"link\">Perhelion</a>\n\nused under <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">CC0 1.0</a></figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.10.

Tokenization {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tokenization}\nTokenization may be used as part of an access control scheme to protect sensitive information. Information that would be\n\nhighly valuable if compromised is replaced with a random token known to the parties involved in the transaction. In a\n\ntypically scenario once the tokens have been established, only the token is sent out over an untrusted network.\n\nImagine you don't want your credit card number exposed to merchants. One solution would be if you used a payment service\n\nthat issued you a new credit card number for each transaction. This credit card number would only be valid for a single\n\ntransaction and would be billed to your regular credit card (which the payment service would have access to). In this\n\ncase the token is the one-time-use credit card number and the sensitive information is your actual credit card number.\n\nPayment services like ApplePay and GoogleWallet do exactly this.\n\n:::\n\n:::::::::::::::::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"7.4. Lab: Linux File Permissions\"}\n\n\n## 7.4. Lab: Linux File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_linux_file_permissions}\nIn this lab we are going to explore UNIX style file permissions and determine what they can do and why they are limited.\n\nFinally we will see how Linux ACLs provide more flexibility in assigning permissions.\n\nWe will be working in a vanilla Ubuntu container and installing software and adding users manually. Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n", "topic": "Designing an access control scheme for a Linux system that incorporates both traditional file permissions and ACLs to meet specific security requirements.", "question": "What command would you use to add read and execute permissions for a specific user to an existing directory, while keeping the traditional permissions intact, and how would you verify that these permissions have been correctly applied?", "choices": {"A": "chmod u+r,x <directory>", "B": "setfacl -m u:<user>:r-x <directory>", "C": "chown <user> <directory>", "D": "getfacl -m u:<user>:r-x <directory>"}, "answer": "B", "explanation": "The correct answer involves using the `setfacl` command to modify the ACL of the directory, specifically adding read and execute permissions for a specified user.

FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments.

You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

{"context": "## 1.2. Learning the Lingo {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__learning_the_lingo}\nIn general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary. Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

SSH Keys\"}\n\n\n### 7.3.7. SSH Keys {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ssh_keys}\nSecure Shell Server (SSH) supports the use of asymmetric encryption keys for authentication. Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data.

{"context": "## 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

Most Linux\n\ndistributions include a simple utility for creating an MD5 hash based on a file's contents. This command is named\n\nmd5sum. Typically this is used to detect if a file has been tampered with. A website may provide links to download\n\nsoftware as well as an MD5 hash of the files so that you know what you've downloaded is correct. Similarly a security\n\nsystem may keep md5sums (MD5 hashes) of certain critical files to determine if they have been tampered with by malware.\n\nLet's practice taking the md5sum of the `/etc/passwd`{.literal} file:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@8e0962021f85:/# md5sum /etc/passwd\n\n9911b793a6ca29ad14ab9cb40671c5d7  /etc/passwd \u2460</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* The first part of this line is the MD5 hash, the second part is the file name\n\n:::\n\nNow we'll make a file with *your* first name in it and store it in /tmp/name.txt:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@8e0962021f85:/# echo &quot;&lt;your_name&gt;&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/name.txt \u2460</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* Substitute your actual first name for \\<your_name\\>\n\n:::\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat is the md5sum of `/tmp/name.txt`{.literal}?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nFor our final activity, lets take a look at some of the weaknesses of hashes.\n\n**Hash Cracking**\n\nPasswords in a Linux system are hashed and stored in the `/etc/shadow`{.literal} file.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed. These tables may take up terabytes of disk space, but can make cracking even complicated hashes much simpler.\n\n<p>\n\nLet's use a custom utility named\n\n<code class=\"literal\">\n\n[\\`crypt`</code>`{=html}](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/blob/main/labs/hash/crypt.c){.link} to show that we have the\n\nactual password.

{"context": "## 6.1. False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine.
