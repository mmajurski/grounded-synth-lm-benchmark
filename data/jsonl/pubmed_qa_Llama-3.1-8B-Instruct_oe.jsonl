{"context": "Older adults typically perform worse on measures of working memory (WM) than do young adults; however, age-related differences in WM performance might be reduced if older adults use effective encoding strategies.\n\nThe purpose of the current experiment was to evaluate WM performance after training individuals to use effective encoding strategies.\n\nParticipants in the training group (older adults: n = 39; young adults: n = 41) were taught about various verbal encoding strategies and their differential effectiveness and were trained to use interactive imagery and sentence generation on a list-learning task. Participants in the control group (older: n = 37; young: n = 38) completed an equally engaging filler task. All participants completed a pre- and post-training reading span task, which included self-reported strategy use, as well as two transfer tasks that differed in the affordance to use the trained strategies - a paired-associate recall task and the self-ordered pointing task.\n\nBoth young and older adults were able to use the target strategies on the WM task and showed gains in WM performance after training. The age-related WM deficit was not greatly affected, however, and the training gains did not transfer to the other cognitive tasks. In fact, participants attempted to adapt the trained strategies for a paired-associate recall task, but the increased strategy use did not benefit their performance.\n\n", "topic": "What are the two transfer tasks used in the experiment, and how do they differ in terms of affordance to use the trained strategies?", "question": "What are the two transfer tasks used in the experiment, and how do they differ in terms of affordance to use the trained strategies?", "answer": "A paired-associate recall task and the self-ordered pointing task, which differ in that the paired-associate recall task allows for more strategy use.", "explanation": "This question requires the reader to understand the experimental design and the specific tasks used in the study, as well as to think critically about the affordance of the trained strategies.", "question_token_count": 28, "answer_correctness_score": 8, "explanation_validity_score": 7, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 31, "choices": null}
