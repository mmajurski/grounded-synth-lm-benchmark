Known as the First Battle of Bull Run (or Manassas), the engagement began when about 35,000 Union troops marched from the federal capital in Washington, D.C. to strike a Confederate force of 20,000 along a small river known as Bull Run. After fighting on the defensive for most of the day, the rebels rallied and were able to break the Union right flank, sending the Federals into a chaotic retreat towards Washington. The Confederate victory gave the South a surge of confidence and shocked many in the North, who realized the war would not be won as easily as they had hoped. [PAR] Google [PAR] Prelude to the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) [PAR] By July 1861, two months after Confederate troops opened fire on Fort Sumter to begin the Civil War, the northern press and public were eager for the Union Army to make an advance on Richmond ahead of the planned meeting of the Confederate Congress there on July 20. Encouraged by early victories by Union troops in western Virginia , and by the war fever spreading through the North, President Abraham Lincoln ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to mount an offensive that would hit quickly and decisively at the enemy and open the way to Richmond, thus bringing the war to a mercifully quick end. The offensive would begin with an attack on more than 20,000 Confederate troops under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction, Virginia (25 miles from Washington , D.C.) along a little river known as Bull Run. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] After First Manassas, Stonewall Jackson further distinguished himself in the Shenandoah Valley, Second Manassas and Fredericksburg. The man Lee called his \"right arm\" was accidentally shot by his own men at Chancellorsville and died of complications relating to the injury. [PAR] The cautious McDowell, then in command of the 35,000 Union volunteer troops gathered in the Federal capital, knew that his men were ill prepared and pushed for a postponement of the advance to give him time for additional training. But Lincoln ordered him to begin the offensive nonetheless, reasoning (correctly) that the rebel army was made up of similarly amateur soldiers. McDowell\u2019s army began moving out of Washington on July 16; its slow movement allowed Beauregard (who also received advance notice of his enemy\u2019s movements through a Confederate espionage network in Washington) to call on his fellow Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for reinforcements. Johnston, in command of some 11,000 rebels in the Shenandoah Valley, was able to outmaneuver a Union force in the region and march his men towards Manassas. [PAR] Battle Begins at Bull Run [PAR] McDowell\u2019s Union force struck on July 21, shelling the enemy across Bull Run while more troops crossed the river at Sudley Ford in an attempt to hit the Confederate left flank. Over two hours, 10,000 Federals gradually pushed back 4,500 rebels across the Warrington turnpike and up Henry House Hill. Reporters, congressmen and other onlookers who had traveled from Washington and were watching the battle from the nearby countryside prematurely celebrated a Union victory, but reinforcements from both Johnston and Beauregard\u2019s armies soon arrived on the battlefield to rally the Confederate troops. In the afternoon, both sides traded attacks and counterattacks near Henry House Hill. On Johnston and Beauregard\u2019s orders, more and more Confederate reinforcements arrived, even as the Federals struggled with coordinating assaults made by different regiments. [PAR] The \u201cRebel Yell\u201d at Bull Run (Manassas) [PAR] By four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, both sides had an equal number of men on the field of battle (about 18,000 on each side were engaged at Bull Run), and Beauregard ordered a counterattack along the entire line.

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry. With no reserves, Tallard's line broke and his troops began fleeing towards H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. They were joined in their flight by the Bavarians from Lutzingen. [PAR] Trapped in Blenheim, Cl\u00e9rambault's men continued the fight until 9:00 PM when over 10,000 of them surrendered. As the French fled southwest, a group of Hessian troops managed to capture Marshall Tallard, who was to spend the next seven years in captivity in England. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Aftermath & Impact: [PAR] In the fighting at Blenheim, the Allies lost 4,542 killed and 7,942 wounded, while the French and Bavarians suffered approximately 20,000 killed and wounded as well as 14,190 captured. The Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim ended the French threat to Vienna and removed the aura of invincibility that surrounded the armies of Louis XIV.

The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality:  of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for machine-made paper, while quires of 24 sheets are often used for handmade or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets. ) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, depending on the type of paper.  [PAR] Nomenclature [PAR] The current word \"quire\" derives from OE \"quair\" or \"guaer\", from OF \"quayer\", \"cayer\", (cf. modern Fr. cahier), from L. quaternum, \"by fours\", \"fourfold\". Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the association of \"quaire\" with \"four\" was quickly lost. [PAR] History [PAR] In the Middle Ages, a quire (also called a \"gathering\") was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term \"quaternion\" (or sometimes quaternum) designates such a quire. A quire made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a \"bifolium\" (plural \"bifolia\"); a \"binion\" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a \"quinion\" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian term for quire, quinterno di carta. [PAR] Formerly, when paper was packed at the paper mill, the top and bottom quires were made up of slightly damaged sheets (\"outsides\") to protect the good quires (\"insides\"). These outside quires were known as \"cassie quires\" (from Fr. cass\u00e9e, \"broken\"), or \"cording quires\" and had only 20 sheets to the quire.  The printer William Caslon in a book published in 1770 mentions both 24- and 25-sheet quires; he also details printer's wastage, and the sorting and recycling of damaged cassie quires.

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for males, and this section will discuss the 4 main types of male voices, their respective pitch ranges, unique tonal characteristics, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One important point to note: These 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type \u2013 are not to be confused with each other. [PAR] The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that our voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas the Type of Voice refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to understand more about how to find your own vocal range, as well as how to determine your own voice type using the various criteria! [PAR] Now, the 4 main types of male voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Countertenor [PAR] Let us look at each of these male voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. COUNTERTENOR [PAR] The Countertenor Voice may actually be unfamiliar to those of us not from the classical realm, as many of us would probably only have heard of the 3 main male voices \u2013 Tenor, Baritone and Bass. [PAR] The Countertenor voice is the highest of the adult male voice types, and has a vocal range that is similar to that of the Female Contralto Voice, the lowest of the female voice types! In the Mandarin pop scene, certain singers like Jeff Chang and the lead singer of popular pop rock band Soda Green would probably qualify as countertenor voices! [PAR] An approximate Countertenor Vocal Range would be from a G note below the middle C (G3) to a high F one octave above the middle C (F5). Be sure to support your voice well with your breath so as to get a more accurate representation of the range in your voice. Check out the section on \u2018How to Find Your Singing Range and Voice Type\u2019 to get some tips on finding your range on your own! [PAR] Also, the Tessitura or most comfortable singing range for Countertenors lies above that of the Tenor and other adult male voices. The Countertenor voice would usually be able to sing the high head voice notes with great ease and brightness in tone, and would often be confused by many listeners with regular female voices. [PAR] 2. TENOR [PAR] The Tenor Voice is the highest of the main male vocal types that most people would be familiar with, with the typical tenor vocal range lying between the C note one octave below middle C (C3) to the C note one octave above middle C (C5)! This means that it would lie just slightly below the Countertenor voice, but has similar characteristics in the sense that the Tenor would also be able to sing most high notes with ease and vocalize the head voice notes with strength and brightness! [PAR] The Tenor voice would probably transition into his middle voice around the D or E note above middle C (D4 or E4) and shift into head voice around the F sharp or G above middle C (F4 or G4). The tenor tessitura would lie between that of the Countertenor\u2019s and the Baritone\u2019s. Do make sure that we avoid certain common singing problems like jaw tightness when we attempt to find out where our vocal register transitions lie, as this will affect the notes at which we transition, affecting the voice type we may classify ourselves to be! [PAR] Famous Tenor voices include the 3 Tenors \u2013 Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as well as other classical singers like Enrico Caruso and pop singers like Elton John, Stevie Wonder. In the Mandarin pop scene, JJ Lin Junjie and Jay Chou would probably be considered Tenor voices too! [PAR] 3.

[PAR] History [PAR] Founding [PAR] England's crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, became the catalyst for England's rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy. No public funds were available, and the credit of William III's government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the \u00a31,200,000 (at 8% p.a.) that the government wanted. [PAR] To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes.  The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The \u00a31.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy.

This helped the new Kingdom of Great Britain \u2013 England and Scotland were formally united in 1707 \u2013 to become powerful.

Nokia builds bridges between people--both when they are far apart and face-to-face--and also bridges the gap between people and the information they need. [PAR] History of Nokia Corporation [PAR] Nokia Corporation is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, serving customers in 130 countries. Nokia is divided into four business groups: Mobile Phones, Multimedia, Enterprise Solutions, and Networks. The Mobile Phones group markets wireless voice and data products in consumer and corporate markets. The Multimedia segment sells mobile gaming devices, home satellite systems, and cable television set-top boxes. The Enterprise Solutions group develops wireless systems for use in the corporate sector. Wireless switching and transmission equipment is sold through the company's Networks division. Nokia operates 15 manufacturing facilities in nine countries and maintains research and development facilities in 12 countries. [PAR] 19th-Century Origins [PAR] Originally a manufacturer of pulp and paper, Nokia was founded as Nokia Company in 1865 in a small town of the same name in central Finland. Nokia was a pioneer in the industry and introduced many new production methods to a country with only one major natural resource, its vast forests. As the industry became increasingly energy-intensive, the company even constructed its own power plants. But for many years, Nokia remained an important yet static firm in a relatively forgotten corner of northern Europe. Nokia shares were first listed on the Helsinki exchange in 1915. [PAR] The first major changes in Nokia occurred several years after World War II. Despite its proximity to the Soviet Union, Finland has always remained economically connected with Scandinavian and other Western countries, and as Finnish trade expanded Nokia became a leading exporter. [PAR] During the early 1960s Nokia began to diversify in an attempt to transform the company into a regional conglomerate with interests beyond Finnish borders. Unable to initiate strong internal growth, Nokia turned its attention to acquisitions. The government, however, hoping to rationalize two underperforming basic industries, favored Nokia's expansion within the country and encouraged its eventual merger with Finnish Rubber Works, which was founded in 1898, and Finnish Cable Works, which was formed in 1912, to form Nokia Corporation. When the amalgamation was completed in 1966, Nokia was involved in several new industries, including integrated cable operations, electronics, tires, and rubber footwear, and had made its first public share offering. [PAR] In 1967 Nokia set up a division to develop design and manufacturing capabilities in data processing, industrial automation, and communications systems. The division was later expanded and made into several divisions, which then concentrated on developing information systems, including personal computers and workstations, digital communications systems, and mobile phones. Nokia also gained a strong position in modems and automatic banking systems in Scandinavia. [PAR] Oil Crisis, Corporate Changes: 1970s [PAR] Nokia continued to operate in a stable but parochial manner until 1973, when it was affected in a unique way by the oil crisis. Years of political accommodation between Finland and the Soviet Union ensured Finnish neutrality in exchange for lucrative trade agreements with the Soviets, mainly Finnish lumber products and machinery in exchange for Soviet oil. By agreement, this trade was kept strictly in balance. But when world oil prices began to rise, the market price for Soviet oil rose with it. Balanced trade began to mean greatly reduced purchasing power for Finnish companies such as Nokia. [PAR] Although the effects were not catastrophic, the oil crisis did force Nokia to reassess its reliance on Soviet trade (about 12 percent of sales) as well as its international growth strategies. Several contingency plans were drawn up, but the greatest changes came after the company appointed a new CEO, Kari Kairamo, in 1975. [PAR] Kairamo noted the obvious: Nokia was too big for Finland.

[PAR] Released 4/14/2014 [PAR] Herpes Zoster in People Who Received Varicella Vaccine [PAR] Herpes zoster, also known as zoster and shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). [PAR] Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Once the illness resolves, the virus remains dormant (latent) in the dorsal root ganglia. VZV can reactive later in a person\u2019s life and cause a painful, maculopapular rash called herpes zoster. [PAR] Anyone who has had varicella or gotten varicella vaccine can develop herpes zoster. Most people typically have only one episode of herpes zoster in their lifetime. However, second and even third episodes are possible. [PAR] Clinical Features [PAR] People with herpes zoster most commonly have a rash in one or two adjacent dermatomes (localized zoster). The rash most commonly appears on the trunk along a thoracic dermatome. The rash does not usually cross the body\u2019s midline. However, approximately 20% of people have rash that overlaps adjacent dermatomes. Less commonly, the rash can be more widespread and affect three or more dermatomes. This condition is called disseminated zoster. This generally occurs only in people with compromised or suppressed immune systems. Disseminated zoster can be difficult to distinguish from varicella. [PAR] The rash is usually painful, itchy or tingly. These symptoms may precede rash onset by days to weeks. Some people may also have headache, photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), and malaise in the prodromal phase. [PAR] The rash develops into clusters of clear vesicles. New vesicles continue to form over three to five days and progressively dry and crust over. They usually heal in two to four weeks. There may be permanent pigmentation changes and scarring on the skin. [PAR] Complications [PAR] Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster. It is a persistent pain in the area where the rash once was. PHN is diagnosed in people who have pain that persists after their rash has resolved. Some define PHN as any duration of pain after the rash resolves; others define it as duration of pain for more than 30 days, or for more than 90 days after rash onset. PHN can last for weeks or months and occasionally, for many years. [PAR] A person's risk of having PHN after herpes zoster increases with age. Older adults are more likely to have PHN and to have longer lasting and more severe pain. Approximately 13% (and possibly more) of people 60 years of age and older with herpes zoster will get PHN. PHN is rare in people younger than 40 years old. Other predictors of PHN include the level of pain a person has when they have the rash and the size of their rash. [PAR] Other complications of herpes zoster include\u2014 [PAR] ophthalmic involvement with acute or chronic ocular sequelae (herpes zoster ophthalmicus); [PAR] bacterial superinfection of the lesions, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus and, less commonly, due to group A beta hemolytic streptococcus; [PAR] cranial and peripheral nerve palsies; and [PAR] visceral involvement, such as meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and acute retinal necrosis. [PAR] People with compromised or suppressed immune systems are more likely to have complications from herpes zoster. They are more likely to have severe rash that lasts longer. Also, they are at increased risk of developing disseminated herpes zoster. [PAR] \u00a0 Top of Page [PAR] Vaccination [PAR] The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends zoster vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) for people aged 60 years and older. Even people who have had herpes zoster should receive the vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. [PAR] Herpes zoster vaccine is approved by FDA for people aged 50 years and older.

[PAR] Three of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer..

Nigeria is officially a democratic secular country.  [PAR] Modern-day Nigeria has been the site of numerous kingdoms and tribal states over the millennia. The modern state originated from British colonial rule beginning in the 19th century, and the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914. The British set up administrative and legal structures whilst practising indirect rule through traditional chiefdoms. Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960, and plunged into a civil war from 1967 to 1970. It has since alternated between democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships, until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999, with the 2011 presidential elections considered the first to be reasonably free and fair.

The official language is English. Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Christians, who live mostly in the southern part of the country, and Muslims in the northern part. A minority of the population practise religions indigenous to Nigeria, such as those native to Igbo and Yoruba peoples.

It overtook South Africa to become Africa's largest economy in 2014.   Also, the debt-to-GDP ratio is only 11 percent, which is 8 percent below the 2012 ratio.   Nigeria is considered to be an emerging market by the World Bank;  It has been identified as a regional power on the African continent,   a middle power in international affairs,     and has also been identified as an emerging global power.    Nigeria is a member of the MINT group of countries, which are widely seen as the globe's next \"BRIC-like\" economies.

L'Escargot - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Though most famous for beating Red Rum in the 1975 Grand National, L'Escargot had already made his name by twice winning the Gold Cup, in 1970 and 1971. [PAR] L'Escargot's first Gold Cup victory in 1970 was notable for the fact that it started as a 33/1 outsider. Only the 100/1 winner Norton's Coin has ever won a Gold Cup at longer odds. [PAR] 5. Kauto Star - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] The French-bred Kauto Star is the only horse to have regained a Gold Cup and has also the only horse to win the King George VI Chase four consecutive times. [PAR] Having won the Gold Cup as favourite in 2007, Kauto Star was beaten by his stablemate Denman in 2008. The Paul Nicholls horse bounced back to regain the Gold Cup in 2009, as he defeated Denman by 13 lengths, with a run described by Timeform as: \"Arguably the best performance in the race since Arkle.\" [PAR] 4. Cottage Rake - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Cottage Rake was failed by a vet on three separate examinations, before embarking on a jumping career in which the horse won three Cheltenham Gold Cups. [PAR] Consecutive victories in 1948,1949 and 1950 saw Cottage Rake become only the second horse to win the Gold Cup three times in a row. After his third victory, Cottage Rake completely lost form, but had already done enough to write it's name into the history books. [PAR] 3. Best Mate - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Best Mate won three consecutive Gold Cups between 2002 and 2004. It is possible that the horse and jockey Jim Culloty would have gone on to eclipse the legendary Arkle and win a fourth Gold Cup, but Best Mate pulled out of the race in 2005 having burst a blood vessel just eight days before the race. [PAR] That same year, Best Mate hit the front pages, after he suffered a heart attack and died while racing at Exeter. Best Mate's ashes were buried beside the winning post at Cheltenham, where he had enjoyed so many triumphs. [PAR] 2. Arkle - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Arkle won the Gold Cup in 1964, 1965 and 1966. Such was Arkle's dominance at the time, that it is likely that he would have gone on to win the race again, but a fractured pedal bone saw the horse put out for retirement. [PAR] At 212, Arkle's Timeform rating is still the highest ever awarded to a steeplechaser (Kauto Star is the joint third highest ever on 191). Arkle also holds the record of being the shortest priced favourite in any Gold Cup, having triumphed in 1966 at 1/10. [PAR] 1. Golden Miller - 5 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] The most successful Gold Cup horse of all time was Golden Miller, who won the race five times consecutively between 1932 and 1936. As there was no Gold Cup staged in either 1931 or 1937, it's possible that the thoroughbred could have had an even better record.

A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Scotland during the Roman EmpireScotland during the Roman Empire refers to the protohistorical period during which the Roman Empire interacted with the area that is now Scotland, which was known to them as \"Caledonia\". Roman legions arrived around \u00a071, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \"Britain\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \"Albion\", Romans under Q.\u00a0Petillius Cerialis and Gn.\u00a0Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \"Mons Graupius\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. [PAR] The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held any Scottish land at all for about 80 years. Some Scottish historians such as Moffat go so far as to say Rome's presence was entirely uninfluential. \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti, Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast as well. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. [PAR] The dawn of Scottish history [PAR] Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. [PAR] The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \"very large\" British Isles called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285\u00a0 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).  [PAR] The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in \u00a043 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.   The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.  Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.

On that day the United Kingdom changed from the centuries old tradition of using 12 pence to the shilling and 20 shillings to the pound to a new decimal 100 new pence to the pound. [PAR] Options considered [PAR] There had been much debate as to the best way of implementing the switch. [PAR] Australia used a dollar valued at ten old shillings, making the new cent equal to 1.2 old pence, a small change in value. [PAR] An alternative was to go to a pound-mil system, with a mil equal to 0.24 old pence, a latter-day successor to the farthing. [PAR] Another was to keep the penny and have a new unit at 100 pence (eight shillings and fourpence). [PAR] However, in the UK the pound was considered to be particularly important because of the UK's international trading status.  In addition, having a new penny worth 2.4 old pence was less of a problem as inflation had made its purchasing power insignificant.  As a temporary measure a half new penny was introduced, but as will be seen this had a short life.  There was even a pattern quarter penny made in aluminium, but this was not proceeded with. [PAR] It was realised at the time that the decision was made that the life of the halfpenny would be very short, but it was felt necessary despite the considerable extra cost of having to mint the coin.  Banks never accepted transactions involving an odd halfpenny. [PAR] The Timetable for the Change [PAR] The change was made gradually over three years, in a number of stages. [PAR] In 1968 new shillings and florins were issued as 5 new pence and 10 new pence coins.  The older shillings and florins continued to    circulate long after decimalisation until the size of the coins was reduced.  Theoretically    silver coins from 1816 could still have been found in change, but the active   withdrawal of silver in the years following the change in 1947, followed   by the combination of a dramatic rise in the price of silver with devaluation   in 1967 meant that silver coins rapidly vanished from circulation. [PAR] Blue plastic wallets containing the new 5p and 10p coins dated 1968, along with 1/2p, 1p and 2p   coins dated 1971 were put on sale. These wallets are still very common. [PAR] In October 1969 the 50 new pence piece replaced the 10 shilling note, which ceased to be legal tender on 22nd November 1970. [PAR] The old halfpenny was demonetised on 1st August 1969. [PAR] The half-crown was demonetised on 1st January 1970. [PAR] The remaining decimal coins became legal tender on 15th February 1971.   Maundy coins (and silver threepenny pieces of Maundy design, i.e. with   a crowned three on the reverse) were revalued as being in new pence at the same time. [PAR] The changeover was so rapid that the old penny and nickel brass threepence pieces   had been removed from circulation by the end of 1971, although I know   of one shop in the Yorkshire Dales which continued to use the old currency   for a long time on the basis that 'this new-fangled stuff will never catch on'. [PAR] The old penny and threepence coins ceased to be legal tender on 31st August 1971, just over six months after D-day.  It is no longer possible to exchange them for current coins at a bank.

The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. [PAR] The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978\u201392). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958\u201366), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967\u201392). [PAR] Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u201362) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u201374). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. [PAR] All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. [PAR] Background [PAR] \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". [PAR] The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.) [PAR] The stock-in-trade of Carry On humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (Nurse, Doctor, Again Doctor, Matron), the monarchy (Henry), the Empire (Up the Khyber), the armed forces (Sergeant) and the trade unions (At Your Convenience) as well as the Hammer horror film (Screaming), camping (Camping), foreigners (Abroad), beauty contests (Girls), and caravan holidays (Behind) among others.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical theatreMusical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical\u00a0\u2013 humor, pathos, love, anger\u00a0\u2013 are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals. [PAR] Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America.  These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma!

[PAR] Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America. [PAR] Definitions and scope  [PAR] Book musicals [PAR] Since the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.   The three main components of a book musical are its music, lyrics and book. The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development, and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the libretto (Italian for \u201clittle book\u201d). The music and lyrics together form the score of a musical and includes songs; incidental music; and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\" The interpretation of a musical by is influenced by its creative team, which includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound, which generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some famous production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in Chicago. [PAR] There is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short intermission and the first act frequently longer than the second.

To dam the great Zambezi floodplain was in many ways a hopeful leap into the future. Vast areas of forest and scrub would be inundated. Literally thousands of wild animals would lose their habitats and, more importantly, the local villages would have to be relocated.

[PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The vegetation was strip cleared and burnt, making the lake rich in chemicals from the fired wood and the considerable number of remaining trees provided an essential habitat for many creatures that found their way into the lake. [PAR] Building the dam wall began in the late 1950s. Well over a million cubic metres of concrete was poured into the 36.6 metre high wall with a thickness of over twenty four metres to sustain the pressure of nearly ten million litres of water passing through the spillway each second. At the end of 1958, the sluice gates were closed and in 1963 the maximum level was reached.

It is the fourth largest river in Africa flowing into the Indian Ocean. [PAR] Kariba Dam is located approximately halfway down the Zambezi River. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The Electricity Supply Commission instigated an investigation for possible hydroelectric schemes to be situated at kariba and in 1941 funds were allocated. As a result of this survey, a river gauging station was set up at chirundu as well as at a campsite 25 kilometers downstream from the present dam wall. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Both Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) were in contention as it was thought that the Kafue River Gorge site in Northern Rhodesia was preferable to kariba. The matter was solved in 1951 by a board of experts known as \u201cthe Panel\u201d who all agreed that the dam be built on the Zambezi River, at the Kariba Gorge site.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Prime Minister of CanadaThe Prime Minister of Canada () is the primary minister of the Crown, chairman of the Cabinet, and thus head of government for Canada, charged with advising the Canadian monarch or federal viceroy on the exercise of the executive powers vested in them by the constitution.  Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists only as per long-established convention (originating in Canada's former colonial power, the United Kingdom) that stipulates the monarch's representative, the governor general, must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable (), a privilege maintained for life. [PAR] The current, and 23rd, Prime Minister of Canada is the Liberal Party's Justin Trudeau, who was appointed on November 4, 2015, by Governor General David Johnston, following the general election that took place that year. [PAR] Origin of the office [PAR] The position of prime minister is not outlined in any Canadian constitutional document and is mentioned only in passing in the Constitution Act, 1982,   and the Letters Patent, 1947 issued by King George VI.  The office and its functions are instead governed by constitutional conventions and modelled on the same office in the United Kingdom. [PAR] Qualifications and selection [PAR] The prime minister, along with the other ministers in cabinet, is appointed by the governor general on behalf of the monarch. However, by the conventions of responsible government, designed to maintain administrative stability, the viceroy will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support, or confidence, of a majority of the directly-elected members of the House of Commons;  as a practical matter, this is often the leader of a party whose members form a majority, or a very large plurality, of Members of Parliament (MPs).  There are no age or citizenship restrictions on the position of prime minister itself. [PAR] While there is no legal requirement for the prime minister to be a member of parliament, for practical and political reasons the prime minister is expected to win a seat very promptly.  However, in rare circumstances individuals who are not sitting members of the House of Commons have been appointed to the position of prime minister. Two former prime ministers\u2014Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell\u2014served in the 1890s while members of the Senate. Both, in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate, succeeded prime ministers who had died in office\u2014John A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894. That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario. [PAR] Prime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible.  For example, William Lyon Mackenzie King, after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election (that his party won), briefly \"governed from the hallway\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power. Turner was the last sitting prime minister to not hold a commons seat. [PAR] Should a sitting prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature, or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat, the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by-election. A safe seat is usually chosen; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party's new leader in the by-election, the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention.

This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the River Witham at the foot of a large hill (on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle). [PAR] The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brythonic language of Iron Age Britain's Celtic inhabitants as Lindon \"The Pool\",  presumably referring to the Brayford Pool (compare the etymology of the name Dublin, from the Gaelic dubh linn \"black pool\"). The extent of this original settlement is unknown as its remains are now buried deep beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins, and modern Lincoln. [PAR] Roman history: Lindum Colonia [PAR] The Romans conquered this part of Britain in AD 48 and shortly afterwards built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake formed by the widening of the River Witham (the modern day Brayford Pool) and at the northern end of the Fosse Way Roman road (A46). The Celtic name Lindon was subsequently Latinised to Lindum and given the title Colonia when it was converted into a settlement for army veterans.  [PAR] The conversion to a colonia was made when the legion moved on to York (Eboracum) in AD 71. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after its founder Domitian, was established within the walls of the hilltop fortress with the addition of an extension of about equal area, down the hillside to the waterside below. [PAR] It became a major flourishing settlement, accessible from the sea both through the River Trent and through the River Witham. On the basis of the patently corrupt list of British bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles, the city is now often considered to have been the capital of the province of Flavia Caesariensis which was formed during the late-3rd century Diocletian Reforms. Subsequently, however, the town and its waterways fell into decline. By the close of the 5th century the city was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a Praefectus Civitatis, for Saint Paulinus visited a man of this office in Lincoln in AD 629. [PAR] AD 410\u20131066 [PAR] During this period the Latin name Lindum Colonia was shortened in Old English to become first Lindocolina, then Lincylene.  [PAR] After the first destructive Viking raids, the city once again rose to some importance, with overseas trading connections. In Viking times Lincoln was a trading centre that issued coins from its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to the mint at York.  After the establishment of Dane Law in 886, Lincoln became one of The Five Boroughs in the East Midlands. Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that this area, deserted since Roman times, received new timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system in about 900.

Together with then-US President George W. Bush, he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq, an act which remains highly controversial.   [PAR] From 1983 to 2007, Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under Blair's leadership, the party used the phrase \"New Labour\", to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism. Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity.  Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism.  [PAR] In May 1997, the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory, the largest in its history, allowing Blair, at 43 years old, to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In September 1997, Blair attained early personal popularity, receiving a 93% public approval rating, after his public response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.    The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership: in 2001, in which it won another landslide victory, and in 2005, with a reduced majority. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act, and Freedom of Information Act. Blair's government also carried out the devolution, the establishing of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto. In Northern Ireland, Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. [PAR] Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration, and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and, more controversially, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq, including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression.  In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary. [PAR] Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007, and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown.  On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East, which he held until 27 May 2015. He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name, including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.  [PAR] Early life [PAR] Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland,  on 6 May 1953,   the second son of Leo and Hazel ( Corscadden) Blair. Leo Blair, the illegitimate  son of two English actors, had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife, Mary. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and later died in) Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1923, where his wife, Sarah Margaret (n\u00e9e Lipsett), gave birth to Blair's mother, Hazel, above the family's grocery shop.  [PAR] Blair has one elder brother, Sir William Blair, a High Court judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Last of the Summer WineLast of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke that was originally broadcast on the BBC. Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Scotland during the Roman EmpireScotland during the Roman Empire refers to the protohistorical period during which the Roman Empire interacted with the area that is now Scotland, which was known to them as \"Caledonia\". Roman legions arrived around \u00a071, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \"Britain\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \"Albion\", Romans under Q.\u00a0Petillius Cerialis and Gn.\u00a0Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \"Mons Graupius\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. [PAR] The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held any Scottish land at all for about 80 years. Some Scottish historians such as Moffat go so far as to say Rome's presence was entirely uninfluential. \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti, Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast as well. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. [PAR] The dawn of Scottish history [PAR] Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. [PAR] The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \"very large\" British Isles called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285\u00a0 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).  [PAR] The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in \u00a043 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.   The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.  Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.   Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his De Chorographia, written around \u00a043, that there were 30 Orkney islands and seven Haemodae (possibly Shetland).Breeze, David J.", "topic": "Analyze the claim that Rome's presence in Scotland was entirely uninfluential, providing evidence to support or refute this assertion.", "question": "Considering the assertion by some Scottish historians that Roman presence was entirely uninfluential, what evidence within the provided text suggests a more nuanced impact, even if indirect?", "answer": "The emergence of the Picts, Romanized Britons, and the introduction of Christianity and literacy demonstrate a nuanced impact despite a limited period of direct control.", "explanation": "The text explicitly states that some historians, like Moffat, believe Rome's presence was uninfluential.

In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century.  The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] MinnesotaMinnesota (; locally ) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The name comes from the Dakota word for \"clear blue water\".  Owing to its large number of lakes, the state is informally known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    [PAR] Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. [PAR] Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non-native inhabitants. A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland. Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many first working in iron mines. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, Somalia, and Latin America has broadened the state's historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota has America's largest Somali population.  Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: Mnisota. The root mni (also spelled mini or minne) means \"water\" and \"t\u014d\" (\"ta\") means \"blue\".  Mnisota can be translated as clear blue water or clouded blue water depending on pronunciation.   Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it mnisota. Many places in the state have similar names, such as Minnehaha Falls (\"laughing water\" (waterfall)), Minneiska (\"white water\"), Minneota (\"much water\"), Minnetonka (\"big water\"), Minnetrista (\"crooked water\"), and Minneapolis, a combination of mni and polis, the Greek word for \"city\".  [PAR] Geography [PAR] Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state is part of the U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north.

[PAR] The Football League, also known as the npower Football League for sponsorship reasons, is a league competition featuring professional association football clubs from England and Wales. [PAR] Founded in 1888, it is the oldest such competition in world football. It was the top level football league in England from its foundation until 1992. [PAR] Since 1995 it has had 72 clubs evenly divided into three divisions, which are currently known as The Championship, League One and League Two. Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest placed clubs in the Premier League. [PAR] A director of Aston Villa, William McGregor, was the first to set out to bring some order to a chaotic world where clubs arranged their own fixtures. On March 2, 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. [PAR] The first meeting was held at Anderson's Hotel in London on March 23, 1888, on the eve of the FA Cup Final. The Football League was formally created and named in Manchester at a further meeting on April 17 at the Royal Hotel. [PAR] In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League to take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal and on May 27, 1992, the Premier League as we know it today was formed. [PAR] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. [PAR] There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions. [PAR] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon. [PAR] A total of 43 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992 until the end of the 2009/10 season. Two other clubs (Luton Town and Notts County) were signatories to the original agreement that created the Premier League, but were relegated prior to the inaugural Premier League season and have not subsequently returned to the top flight. [PAR] Seven clubs have been members of the Premier League for every season since its inception. This group is composed of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. [PAR] Due to insistence by Fifa that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. [PAR] On June 8, 2006, Fifa requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007/08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction. Ultimately, the 2007/08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  [PAR] In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. [PAR] Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931\u00a0BC, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. [PAR] According to the Talmud, Solomon is one of the 48 prophets.  In the Qur'an, he is considered a major prophet, and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman, son of David.  Solomon (Arabic \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 Sulaym\u0101n) was, according to the Qur'an, a king of ancient Israel as well as the son of David. The Qur'an recognizes Solomon as a prophet and a divinely-appointed monarch. Islamic tradition generally holds that Solomon was the third king of Israel and was a just and wise ruler for the nation.  [PAR] The Hebrew Bible credits him as the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem. It portrays him as great in wisdom, wealth, and power beyond any of the previous kings of the country, but ultimately as a human king who sinned. His sins included idolatry and turning away from Yahweh, and led to the kingdom's being torn in two during the reign of his son Rehoboam.  Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends, most notably in the 1st-century apocryphal work known as the Testament of Solomon. In later years, in mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.  [PAR] Biblical account [PAR] Childhood [PAR] Solomon was born in Jerusalem,  the second born child to David and his wife Bathsheba, widow of Uriah the Hittite. The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died before Solomon was conceived as a punishment by Yahweh on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers through Bathsheba, Nathan, Shammua, and Shobab,  besides six known older half-brothers through as many mothers.  [PAR] Succession and administration [PAR] According to the First Book of Kings, when David was old, \"he could not get warm.\"  \"So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

For the time being, they have the fairly clunky Latin and Greek numerical names ununtium (Uut), ununpentium (Uup), ununseptium (Uus), and ununoctium (Uuo), but, by IUPAC rules, their discovers now get the chance to officially name them. [PAR] Online, there\u2019s growing support to name one of these new \u201cheavy metal\u201d elements lemmium in honor of Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy (who died two days before they were announced), and another octarine after the fictional \u201ccolor of magic\u201d in the late Sir Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novels (Pratchett\u00a0died in March 2015). Whether these two petitions will come to fruition remains to be seen\u2014the final names are not likely to be announced until later in the spring\u2014but as IUPAC rules demand all new elements be named after either a mythological concept or character, a mineral, a place, a property of the element itself, or a scientist [ PDF ], it seems unlikely we\u2019ll be seeing lemmium on the walls of chemistry classes any time soon. The stories behind 20 other chemical element names are explained here.\u00a0 [PAR] 1. LITHIUM (3) [PAR] Despite being the least dense metal, lithium takes its name from the Greek word for \u201cstone,\u201d lithos, because it was discovered in a rock (as opposed to the other alkali metals potassium and sodium, which were discovered in plants and animals).\u00a0 [PAR] 2. CARBON (6) [PAR] The name carbon comes from the Latin word carbo, meaning \u201ccoal\u201d or \u201ccharcoal.\u201d A small carbo, incidentally, was a carbunculus, which is the origin of carbuncle.\u00a0 [PAR] 3. NEON (10) [PAR] Neon takes its name from neos, the Greek word for \u201cnew\u201d (it was \u201cnewly\u201d discovered in 1898). [PAR] 4. PHOSPHORUS (15) [PAR] Phosphorus literally means \u201clight-bearer\u201d or \u201clight-bringing,\u201d as the first compound of the element glowed in the dark. A century before it became the name of element 15 in the late 1600s, Phosphorus was an alternative name for the planet Venus, whose appearance in the sky was once believed to strengthen the light and heat of the Sun. [PAR] 5. VANADIUM (23) [PAR] One of the transition metals, pure vanadium is a harsh steel-grey color, but four of its oxidation states produce a rainbow of solutions, colored purple, green, blue, and yellow . Because he was so impressed with how beautiful and varied these solutions were, the Swedish chemist Nils Sefstr\u00f6m chose to name vanadium after Vanad\u00eds, an alternate name for the Norse goddess of beauty, Freya. Vanadium\u2019s next door neighbor, chromium (24), also produces a variety of colored compounds and so takes its name from the Greek word for \u201ccolor,\u201d chroma.\u00a0 [PAR] 6. COBALT (27) [PAR] Cobalt is often naturally found alongside or in minerals combined with arsenic, and when smelted, cobalt ore can emit noxious arsenic-laden fumes. Long before the poisonous qualities of minerals like these could be explained by science, copper\u00a0miners in central Europe had no better explanation than to presume these toxic effects were supernatural, and were caused by devious underground goblins called kobolds who lived inside the rock\u2014and it's from the German word kobold that cobalt gets its name.\u00a0 [PAR] 7. COPPER (29) [PAR] The chemical symbol for copper is Cu, which derives from the metal\u2019s Latin name, cuprum.

[PAR] Since those early days the course and fences have undergone many changes. Most recently the wooden stakes at the core of the fences have been replaced with flexible plastic to reduce the risk of horses and jockeys getting injured. The starting line has also moved further away from the main stand as this helps the horses remain calmer in the moments before the off. [PAR] These changes haven\u2019t effected the essence of the race, which still remains the one of the toughest\u00a0tests of horse and rider in the world. Forty horses line up at the starting tape and around 60% of the entrants will not complete the race, which is four and a half miles\u00a0long and has thirty fence jumps. [PAR] Aintree [PAR] Aintree\u00a0is the home of the Grand National and apart from a couple of years during the first world war, the race has always taken place at the course, which is located just five miles from the centre of Liverpool. Well served by public transport and a train station, the course is modern and offers a wide range of facilities. The Grand National is just one of many race\u00a0meetings that take place during the National Hunt season although not all meetings and races are run over the National course. [PAR] Getting to Aintree is very easy from all parts of the United Kingdom. Liverpool has excellent rail links, motorway access\u00a0and is served by John Lennon Airport. Queues on the day of the Grand National can build up on the roads surrounding the course but this is to be expected for such a popular sporting occasion. Around 70,000 racing fans will\u00a0watch the race live making it one of the biggest sporting events in the calendar. [PAR] Course [PAR] The Grand National course is 4 miles and 4 furlongs long. The horses encounter 16 different fences\u00a0with varying degrees of height and width. Riders must navigate two circuits of the course (missing out fences 15 & 16 on the second circuit)\u00a0before turning for\u00a0the home straight which is the longest run-in of any UK racecourse. [PAR] The Grand National is the longest race in the UK but it\u2019s the difficulty for the fences that provide the real challenge\u00a0to horse and rider.

Those original cross country races are now replicated on racecourses across England and Ireland. However, the Aintree course is arguably the toughest of all.

Known as the First Battle of Bull Run (or Manassas), the engagement began when about 35,000 Union troops marched from the federal capital in Washington, D.C. to strike a Confederate force of 20,000 along a small river known as Bull Run. After fighting on the defensive for most of the day, the rebels rallied and were able to break the Union right flank, sending the Federals into a chaotic retreat towards Washington. The Confederate victory gave the South a surge of confidence and shocked many in the North, who realized the war would not be won as easily as they had hoped. [PAR] Google [PAR] Prelude to the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) [PAR] By July 1861, two months after Confederate troops opened fire on Fort Sumter to begin the Civil War, the northern press and public were eager for the Union Army to make an advance on Richmond ahead of the planned meeting of the Confederate Congress there on July 20. Encouraged by early victories by Union troops in western Virginia , and by the war fever spreading through the North, President Abraham Lincoln ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to mount an offensive that would hit quickly and decisively at the enemy and open the way to Richmond, thus bringing the war to a mercifully quick end. The offensive would begin with an attack on more than 20,000 Confederate troops under the command of General P.G.T.

The man Lee called his \"right arm\" was accidentally shot by his own men at Chancellorsville and died of complications relating to the injury. [PAR] The cautious McDowell, then in command of the 35,000 Union volunteer troops gathered in the Federal capital, knew that his men were ill prepared and pushed for a postponement of the advance to give him time for additional training. But Lincoln ordered him to begin the offensive nonetheless, reasoning (correctly) that the rebel army was made up of similarly amateur soldiers. McDowell\u2019s army began moving out of Washington on July 16; its slow movement allowed Beauregard (who also received advance notice of his enemy\u2019s movements through a Confederate espionage network in Washington) to call on his fellow Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for reinforcements. Johnston, in command of some 11,000 rebels in the Shenandoah Valley, was able to outmaneuver a Union force in the region and march his men towards Manassas. [PAR] Battle Begins at Bull Run [PAR] McDowell\u2019s Union force struck on July 21, shelling the enemy across Bull Run while more troops crossed the river at Sudley Ford in an attempt to hit the Confederate left flank. Over two hours, 10,000 Federals gradually pushed back 4,500 rebels across the Warrington turnpike and up Henry House Hill. Reporters, congressmen and other onlookers who had traveled from Washington and were watching the battle from the nearby countryside prematurely celebrated a Union victory, but reinforcements from both Johnston and Beauregard\u2019s armies soon arrived on the battlefield to rally the Confederate troops.

[PAR] Review [PAR] The Wire: The Complete First Season [PAR] After one episode of The Wire you'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of  its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series'  remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American  masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter  from The Baltimore Sun who cowrote the book that inspired TV's Homicide ,  and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable  street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece to The Corner )  that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on  institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil  police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price  (especially Clockers), the series opens as maverick Detective  Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a  vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's  deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a  haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex  investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance. [PAR] The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so  breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to  life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description.  Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the  unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson,  helmer of The Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to  the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable,  complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention, The Wire is \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy  answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate  in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the  cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to  the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving  you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in  season 2. --Jeff Shannon [PAR] The Wire: The Complete Second Season [PAR] It hardly seems possible, but The Wire's second season is even better than the first .  The \"visual novel\" concept of this masterful HBO series is taken even  further in a rich, labyrinthine plot revolving around the longshoremen  of Baltimore's struggling cargo docks, where corruption, smuggling, and  murder draw the attention of detective McNulty (Dominic West). What  follows is a series of events which at first seem unrelated (including  13 bodies found in a cargo container), and then the ongoing effort to  topple the drug empire of \"Stringer\" Bell (Idris Elba) and the  imprisoned Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris), whose business is suffering  from short supply, high demand, and disruption of distribution. The  dutiful diligence of a Marine Police Patrol Officer and the moral  outrage of the longshoremen's union leader are also factored into the  suspicious goings-on at the loading docks, and what unfolds in these 12  episodes is an American crime epic easily on par with the Godfather saga.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Thunderbirds (TV series)Thunderbirds is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) and distributed by ITC Entertainment. It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series were filmed, comprising a total of 32 episodes. Production ceased after Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television. [PAR] Set in the mid-2060s, Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls, Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray. It follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from IR's secret base in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines. [PAR] Thunderbirds began its first run in the United Kingdom on the ITV network in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. As well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns, the series has been followed by two feature-length film sequels, a live-action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute. The second of two TV remakes, the computer-animated Thunderbirds Are Go, premiered in 2015. [PAR] Widely considered to be the Andersons' most popular and commercially successful series,  Thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects (directed by Derek Meddings) and musical score (composed by Barry Gray). It is also well remembered for its title sequence, which opens with an often-quoted countdown by actor Peter Dyneley (who voiced the character of Jeff): \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1: Thunderbirds Are Go!\" A real-life rescue service, the International Rescue Corps, is named after the organisation featured in the series.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Driest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile - Extreme ScienceDriest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Driest Place: Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Even the Driest Place on Earth has Water [PAR] These incredibly     dry mountains see an average of less than .004 inches/.01cm of     rain per year. Many times this area will go without rainfall at      all for years. Some places in the Atacama Desert have not      had rainfall for over 400 years.  The     Atacama desert is found along the coast of Chile, South America -      right next to the Pacific Ocean - the biggest body of water      in the world. Much of the desert extends up into the Andes mountains      and is very high in elevation. Unlike more familiar deserts, like     the Sahara desert in Africa and the Mojave in California, the Atacama      is actually a pretty cold place, with average daily temperatures ranging      between 0\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. The annual rainfall (or lack of it)      defines a desert, but that doesn't mean that it never rains in Atacama.     Every so often a warming effect over the Pacific Ocean around the      equator changes the weather the world over and even places like the      driest desert in the world can become doused with drenching storms.     Even though Atacama gets almost no rainfall, there is water in this      arid place and you'll find it in the following places: [PAR] Salt Lakes [PAR] During years     of heavy rainfall in the distant past, enough water accumulated in     basins found throughout the Andes to create lakes. Some of the lakes     got their water from melting glaciers at the end of the last ice age.      But in some lakes in the Andes mountains, such as Atacama, more water      is lost through evaporation than is replaced by rainfall so the lakes      are drying up. As the water evaporates, the mineral salts in the water      become more concentrated, creating very salty water. [PAR] Snow [PAR] In the higher          elevations when precipitation comes to Atacama snow falls instead          of rain. There are small patches of unmelted snow in the mountain          tops where in never gets warm enough to melt the snow. [PAR] Underground [PAR] Anywhere you      go in the world, regardless of how much or little it rains, there      is always water underground. After it rains, some of the rainwater      evaporates back into the air, but much of it trickles down into the      ground and stays there - even in the desert. How much water and where      depends on a number of things; soil composition, air and soil surface      temperature, amount and frequency of rainfall/precipitation, and drainage.      Since the Andes is a volcanically active mountain range, the magma      beneath the ground will heat the groundwater in certain places causing      geysers to erupt. [PAR] Fog and Dew [PAR] This mummy of a girl is from the Atacama Desert. Her remains are            estimated to be about 800 years old. Find out more about mummies. [PAR] Most of the precipitation that comes to the      Atacama is in the form of fog that blows in the from the Pacific.      Fog is essentially very low clouds, consisting of water vapor cooling      and beginning to condense. If you've ever been in fog you know that      it can leave you a little moist. When the air temperature reaches      dew point the water vapor in the air condenses to leave little droplets      of water behind. The few things that are able to survive in the Atacama live on the combined moisture from fog and dew. [PAR] Does Anything Live There? [PAR] Many people          have the view that deserts are places forsaken by Mother Nature and          that no living thing would possibly want to set up camp in a place so          dry. Although it is tough to find anything living in the Atacama there          are isolated pockets and small patches of plants, which support life          for animals and insects. Some plant species have adapted well to this          dry environment by developing tap roots that run very deep into the          ground gathering water from below.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is an English Christmas carol that enumerates in the manner of a cumulative song a series of increasingly grand gifts given on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days after Christmas). The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin. \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68.

Subsequent versions have shown considerable variation: [PAR] * In the earliest versions, the word \"On\" is not present at the beginning of each verse\u2014for example, the first verse begins simply \"The first day of Christmas\".  \"On\" was added in Austin's 1909 version, and became very popular thereafter. [PAR] * In the early versions \"my true love sent\" me the gifts. However, a 20th-century variant has \"my true love gave to me\"; this wording has become particularly common in North America.  [PAR] * The 1780 version has \"four colly birds\"\u2014\"colly\" being a regional English expression for \"black\".   This wording must have been opaque to many even in the 19th century: \"canary birds\", \"colour'd birds\", \"curley birds\", and \"corley birds\" are found in its place.  Frederic Austin's 1909 version, which introduced the now-standard melody, also altered the fourth day's gift to four \"calling\" birds, and this variant has become the most popular, although \"colly\" is still found. [PAR] * The \"five gold rings\" may become \"five golden rings\", especially in North America. In the standard melody, this change enables singers to fit one syllable per musical note.  [PAR] * The gifts associated with the final four days are often reordered.  For example, the pipers may be on the ninth day rather than the eleventh.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit).

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Central AmericaCentral America () is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. It is sometimes considered part of South America. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate). [PAR] The Central American land mass has an area of 523780 km2, or almost 0.1% of the Earth's surface. It is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala through central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently; these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property. [PAR] In the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Soon after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 until 1821, most of the territory within Central America\u2014except for the lands that would become Belize and Panama\u2014was governed as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. After achieving independence from Spain in 1821, the former Captaincy General was annexed to the First Mexican Empire, but soon seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1823 to 1838. The seven states finally became independent autonomous nations, beginning with Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (1838), followed by El Salvador (1841), then Panama (1903), and finally Belize (1981). [PAR] Different definitions [PAR] \"Central America\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts: [PAR] * The United Nations geoscheme for the Americas defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States and specifically includes all of Mexico, but clearly this is only for statistical purposes. [PAR] * In Latin America (especially in Ibero-America) and also in Iberia, although it is agreed what Central America is, they also could consider the Americas a single continent, and Central America is considered a part of North America. [PAR] * In Brazil, Central America comprises all countries between Mexico and Colombia, including those in the Caribbean. [PAR] * Mexico, in whole or in part, is sometimes included by British people. [PAR] * Occasionally, regardless of correctness, the term \"Central America\" is used synonymously with \"Middle America\". [PAR] * For the people living in the 5 countries formerly part of the Federal Republic of Central America there is a distinction between the Spanish language terms \"Am\u00e9rica Central\" and \"Centroam\u00e9rica\".  While both can be translated into English as \"Central America\", \"Am\u00e9rica Central\" is generally used to refer to the geographical area of the 7 countries between Mexico and Colombia, while \"Centroam\u00e9rica\" is used when referring to the former members of the Federation emphasizing the shared culture and history of the region. [PAR] History [PAR] In the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area. [PAR] Following Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523.

On that day the United Kingdom changed from the centuries old tradition of using 12 pence to the shilling and 20 shillings to the pound to a new decimal 100 new pence to the pound. [PAR] Options considered [PAR] There had been much debate as to the best way of implementing the switch. [PAR] Australia used a dollar valued at ten old shillings, making the new cent equal to 1.2 old pence, a small change in value. [PAR] An alternative was to go to a pound-mil system, with a mil equal to 0.24 old pence, a latter-day successor to the farthing. [PAR] Another was to keep the penny and have a new unit at 100 pence (eight shillings and fourpence). [PAR] However, in the UK the pound was considered to be particularly important because of the UK's international trading status.  In addition, having a new penny worth 2.4 old pence was less of a problem as inflation had made its purchasing power insignificant.  As a temporary measure a half new penny was introduced, but as will be seen this had a short life.  There was even a pattern quarter penny made in aluminium, but this was not proceeded with. [PAR] It was realised at the time that the decision was made that the life of the halfpenny would be very short, but it was felt necessary despite the considerable extra cost of having to mint the coin.  Banks never accepted transactions involving an odd halfpenny. [PAR] The Timetable for the Change [PAR] The change was made gradually over three years, in a number of stages. [PAR] In 1968 new shillings and florins were issued as 5 new pence and 10 new pence coins.  The older shillings and florins continued to    circulate long after decimalisation until the size of the coins was reduced.  Theoretically    silver coins from 1816 could still have been found in change, but the active   withdrawal of silver in the years following the change in 1947, followed   by the combination of a dramatic rise in the price of silver with devaluation   in 1967 meant that silver coins rapidly vanished from circulation. [PAR] Blue plastic wallets containing the new 5p and 10p coins dated 1968, along with 1/2p, 1p and 2p   coins dated 1971 were put on sale. These wallets are still very common. [PAR] In October 1969 the 50 new pence piece replaced the 10 shilling note, which ceased to be legal tender on 22nd November 1970. [PAR] The old halfpenny was demonetised on 1st August 1969. [PAR] The half-crown was demonetised on 1st January 1970. [PAR] The remaining decimal coins became legal tender on 15th February 1971.   Maundy coins (and silver threepenny pieces of Maundy design, i.e. with   a crowned three on the reverse) were revalued as being in new pence at the same time. [PAR] The changeover was so rapid that the old penny and nickel brass threepence pieces   had been removed from circulation by the end of 1971, although I know   of one shop in the Yorkshire Dales which continued to use the old currency   for a long time on the basis that 'this new-fangled stuff will never catch on'. [PAR] The old penny and threepence coins ceased to be legal tender on 31st August 1971, just over six months after D-day.  It is no longer possible to exchange them for current coins at a bank.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] St Trinian's SchoolSt Trinian's was a British gag cartoon comic strip series, created and drawn by Ronald Searle from 1946 until 1952.  The cartoons all centre on a boarding school for girls, where the teachers are sadists and the girls are juvenile delinquents. The series was Searle's most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films that has outlived the short-running cartoon series. [PAR] Concept [PAR] The first cartoon appeared in 1941, but shortly afterwards Searle had to fulfil his military service. He was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 he started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was a lot darker in comparison with the previous years. [PAR] The school is the antithesis of the type of posh girls' boarding school depicted by Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil; its female pupils are bad and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the uniform of the school that Searle's daughter Kate attended, JAGS in Dulwich. The films implied that the girls were the daughters of gangsters, crooks, shady bookmakers, and other low-lifes and the institution is often referred to as a \"female borstal\". [PAR] The inspiration [PAR] During 1941 Searle had left for the artist's community in the village of Kirkcudbright in Edinburgh and it was whilst visiting the family Johnston there that he made a drawing to please their two schoolgirl daughters, C\u00e9cil\u00e9 and Pat, (their school had been evacuated to New Gala House in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders owing to the war), and Searle was puzzled as to why two schoolgirls should seem so keen to return to their school, an Academy for Young Ladies in Dalkeith Road \u2014 the name of their school was St Trinnean's.   [PAR] Searle's St. Trinian's was based on two independent girls' schools in Cambridge\u2014Perse School for Girls, now known as the co-educational Stephen Perse Foundation, and St Mary's School. Searle, growing up in Cambridge, saw the girls on their way to and from school on a regular basis and they were the original inspiration for the cartoons and the character. Testaments to this fact can be found in the Perse School for Girls' Archive area where there are several original  St Trinian's books, given to the school by Ronald Searle. He also based the school partly on the former Cambridgeshire High School for Girls (now Long Road Sixth Form College).

[PAR] In the films the school became embroiled in various shady enterprises, thanks mainly to Flash, and, as a result, was always threatened with closure by the Ministry.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Driest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile - Extreme ScienceDriest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Driest Place: Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Even the Driest Place on Earth has Water [PAR] These incredibly     dry mountains see an average of less than .004 inches/.01cm of     rain per year. Many times this area will go without rainfall at      all for years. Some places in the Atacama Desert have not      had rainfall for over 400 years.  The     Atacama desert is found along the coast of Chile, South America -      right next to the Pacific Ocean - the biggest body of water      in the world. Much of the desert extends up into the Andes mountains      and is very high in elevation. Unlike more familiar deserts, like     the Sahara desert in Africa and the Mojave in California, the Atacama      is actually a pretty cold place, with average daily temperatures ranging      between 0\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. The annual rainfall (or lack of it)      defines a desert, but that doesn't mean that it never rains in Atacama.     Every so often a warming effect over the Pacific Ocean around the      equator changes the weather the world over and even places like the      driest desert in the world can become doused with drenching storms.     Even though Atacama gets almost no rainfall, there is water in this      arid place and you'll find it in the following places: [PAR] Salt Lakes [PAR] During years     of heavy rainfall in the distant past, enough water accumulated in     basins found throughout the Andes to create lakes. Some of the lakes     got their water from melting glaciers at the end of the last ice age.      But in some lakes in the Andes mountains, such as Atacama, more water      is lost through evaporation than is replaced by rainfall so the lakes      are drying up. As the water evaporates, the mineral salts in the water      become more concentrated, creating very salty water. [PAR] Snow [PAR] In the higher          elevations when precipitation comes to Atacama snow falls instead          of rain. There are small patches of unmelted snow in the mountain          tops where in never gets warm enough to melt the snow. [PAR] Underground [PAR] Anywhere you      go in the world, regardless of how much or little it rains, there      is always water underground. After it rains, some of the rainwater      evaporates back into the air, but much of it trickles down into the      ground and stays there - even in the desert. How much water and where      depends on a number of things; soil composition, air and soil surface      temperature, amount and frequency of rainfall/precipitation, and drainage.      Since the Andes is a volcanically active mountain range, the magma      beneath the ground will heat the groundwater in certain places causing      geysers to erupt. [PAR] Fog and Dew [PAR] This mummy of a girl is from the Atacama Desert. Her remains are            estimated to be about 800 years old. Find out more about mummies. [PAR] Most of the precipitation that comes to the      Atacama is in the form of fog that blows in the from the Pacific.      Fog is essentially very low clouds, consisting of water vapor cooling      and beginning to condense. If you've ever been in fog you know that      it can leave you a little moist. When the air temperature reaches      dew point the water vapor in the air condenses to leave little droplets      of water behind. The few things that are able to survive in the Atacama live on the combined moisture from fog and dew. [PAR] Does Anything Live There? [PAR] Many people          have the view that deserts are places forsaken by Mother Nature and          that no living thing would possibly want to set up camp in a place so          dry. Although it is tough to find anything living in the Atacama there          are isolated pockets and small patches of plants, which support life          for animals and insects. Some plant species have adapted well to this          dry environment by developing tap roots that run very deep into the          ground gathering water from below.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  [PAR] In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. [PAR] Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

He gained a reputation as a swaggering militarist through his speeches and ill-advised newspaper interviews. While Wilhelm did not actively seek war, and tried to hold back his generals from mobilizing the German army in the summer of 1914, his verbal outbursts and his open enjoyment of the title of Supreme War Lord helped bolster the case of those who blamed him for the conflict. His role in the conduct of the war as well as his responsibility for its outbreak is still controversial. Some historians maintain that Wilhelm was controlled by his generals, while others argue that he retained considerable political power. In late 1918, he was forced to abdicate. He spent the rest of his life in exile in the Netherlands, where he died at age 82. [PAR] Google [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s Early Years [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was born in Potsdam, Germany, on January 27, 1859, the son of Prince Frederick Wilhelm of Prussia (1831-88) and Princess Victoria (1840-1901), the oldest daughter of Queen Victoria of England (1819-1901). The future monarch was the queen\u2019s firstborn grandchild and was genuinely fond of her; in fact, he was holding her in his arms when she died. His ties to Britain through its royal family would play an important part in his later political maneuvering. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was reportedly amused when he heard his cousin King George V (1865-1936) had changed the name of the British royal family from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor in 1917 as a result of anti-German sentiment in Britain during World War I. [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s childhood was shaped by two events, one medical and one political. His birth had been traumatic; in the course of a complicated delivery, the doctor permanently damaged Wilhelm\u2019s left arm. In addition to its smaller size, the arm was useless for such ordinary tasks as cutting certain foods with a knife at mealtime. [PAR] The political event that shaped Wilhelm was the formation of the German Empire under the leadership of Prussia in 1871. Wilhelm was now second in line after his father to become an emperor as well as king of Prussia. Twelve years old at the time, Wilhelm was filled with nationalistic enthusiasm. His later determination to win a \u201cplace in the sun\u201d for Germany had its roots in his childhood. [PAR] An intelligent young man who possessed a lifelong interest in science and technology, Wilhelm was educated at the University of Bonn. His quick mind, however, was combined with an even quicker temper and an impulsive, high-strung personality. He had dysfunctional relationships with both parents, particularly his English mother. Historians still debate the effects of the kaiser\u2019s complicated psychological makeup on his political decisions. [PAR] In 1881, Wilhelm married Princess Augusta Victoria (1858-1921) of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple would go on to have seven children. [PAR] Emperor and King: 1888 [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s father became Kaiser Frederick III of Germany in March 1888. Already ill with terminal throat cancer, he died after a reign of only several months. Wilhelm succeeded his father on June 15, 1888, at the age of 29. Within two years of his coronation, Wilhelm broke with Otto von Bismarck (1815-98), the \u201cIron Chancellor\u201d who had dominated German politics since the 1860s. The kaiser embarked on his so-called New Course, a period of personal rule in which he appointed chancellors who were upper-level civil servants rather than statesmen.

Many of these changes to city names were done to make those names reflect the linguistic systems in the various areas. [PAR] The following is a brief history of some of India's most famous name changes: [PAR] Mumbai vs. Bombay [PAR] Mumbai is one of the world's ten largest cities today and is located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. This world-class city wasn't always known by this name however. Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay, which has its origins in the 1600s with the Portuguese. During their colonization of the area, they began calling it Bombaim - Portuguese for \"Good Bay.\" In 1661 though, this Portuguese colony was given to King Charles II of England after he married the Portuguese princess Catherine de Braganza. When the British then took control of the colony, its name became Bombay- an anglicized version of Bombaim. [PAR] The name Bombay then stuck until 1996 when the Indian government changed it to Mumbai. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] It is believed that this was the name of a Kolis settlement in the same area because many Kolis communities were named after their Hindu deities. By the early 20th Century, one of these settlements was named Mumbadevi for a goddess of the same name. [PAR] Therefore the change to the name of Mumbai in 1996 was an attempt to use the previous Hindi names for a city that was once controlled by the British. The use of the name Mumbai reached a global scale in 2006 when the Associated Press announced it would refer to what was once Bombay as Mumbai. [PAR] Chennai vs. Madras [PAR] However, Mumbai was not the only newly named Indian city in 1996. In August of that same year, the former city of Madras, located in the state of Tamil Nadu, had its name changed to Chennai. [PAR] Both the names Chennai and Madras date back to 1639. In that year, the Raja of Chandragiri, (a suburb in South India), allowed the British East India Company to build a fort near the town of Madraspattinam. At the same time, the local people built another town close to the site of the fort. This town was named Chennappatnam, after the father of one of the early rulers. Later, both the fort and the town grew together but the British shortened their colony's name to Madras while the Indians changed theirs to Chennai. [PAR] The name Madras (shortened from Madraspattinam) also has links to the Portuguese who were present in the area as early as the 1500s. Their exact impact on the naming of the area is unclear however and many rumors exist as to how the name really originated. Many historians believe that it may have come from the Madeiros family who lived there in the 1500s. [PAR] No matter where it originated though, Madras is a much older name than Chennai. Despite that fact, the city was still renamed Chennai because it is in the language of the area\u2019s original inhabitants and Madras was seen as being a Portuguese name and/or was associated with the former British colony. [PAR] Kolkata vs. Calcutta [PAR] More recently, in January 2001, one of the world's 25 largest cities, Calcutta, became Kolkata.

[PAR] The awards ceremony was first broadcast to radio in 1930 and televised in 1953. It is now seen live in more than 200 countries and can be streamed live online.  The Oscars is the oldest entertainment awards ceremony; its equivalents, the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theatre, and the Grammy Awards for music and recording, are modeled after the Academy Awards.

The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.  The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($ in  dollars). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927\u201328 period. The ceremony ran for 15\u00a0minutes. [PAR] Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00\u00a0pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until an occasion when the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners. [PAR] Institutions [PAR] The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. [PAR] At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen English counties and cover 9.3% of England, with no national park in the central counties.

It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW.

Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.

Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

The 50 stars stand for the 50 states of the union, and the 13 stripes stand for the original 13 states. The flag\u2019s width-to-length ratio is 10 to 19. [PAR] Related Topics [PAR] Betsy Ross [PAR] After the American Revolution began, the first unofficial national flag\u2014known as the Continental Colours (or, incorrectly, as the Grand Union Flag or the Cambridge Flag)\u2014was hoisted at Prospect Hill in Charlestown (now in Somerville, Mass.) on Jan. 1, 1776; it was raised, it appears, at the behest of Gen. George Washington , whose headquarters were nearby. The flag had 13 horizontal stripes (probably of red and white or of red, white, and blue) and, in the canton, the first version of the British Union Flag ( Union Jack ). It was used at forts and on naval vessels. Another popular early flag, that of the Sons of Liberty , had the 13 stripes only. The various 18th-century \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flags had only local significance, but in the 20th century such designs were popularized by political protesters. [PAR] The first official national flag, formally approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, was the Stars and Stripes. The blue canton was to contain 13 stars, but the layout of the stars was left undefined, and several patterns are known. The designer of the flag, Congressman Francis Hopkinson , may have had a ring of stars in mind to symbolize (in the words of the flag law) \u201ca new constellation.\u201d Today that pattern is popularly known as the \u201c Betsy Ross flag,\u201d although the claims of her descendants that she made the first Stars and Stripes and that she used the ring pattern are unsubstantiated. Rows of stars (4-5-4 or 3-2-3-2-3) were common, but other variations also existed. The new Stars and Stripes formed part of the military colours carried on Sept. 11, 1777, at the Battle of the Brandywine , perhaps its first such use. [PAR] Similar Topics [PAR] flag of the Confederate States of America [PAR] The Stars and Stripes changed on May 1, 1795, when two more stars and two more stripes were added to reflect the admission to the union of Vermont (1791) and Kentucky (1792). (One such flag was the 1,260-square-foot [117-square-metre] \u201cStar-Spangled Banner,\u201d made by Mary Pickersgill, that Francis Scott Key saw at Fort McHenry in September 1814, inspiring his patriotic poem .) In 1818, after five more states had been admitted, Congress enacted legislation pertaining to a new flag, requiring that henceforth the number of stripes should remain 13, the number of stars should always match the number of states, and any new star should be added on the July 4 following a state\u2019s admission. This has been the system ever since. In all, from 1777 to 1960 (after the admission of Hawaii in 1959) there were 27 versions of the flag\u201425 involving changes in the stars only. An executive order of Oct. 29, 1912, standardized the proportions and relative sizes of the elements of the flag; in 1934 the exact shades of colour were standardized. [PAR] There is no official assignment of meaning or symbolism to the colours of the flag. However, Charles Thomson , secretary of the Continental Congress, in describing the proposed Great Seal, suggested the following symbolism: \u201cWhite signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valour, and Blue\u2026signifies vigilence, perseverence [sic] & justice.\u201d As with many other national flags, the Stars and Stripes has long been a focus of patriotic sentiment .

They include two Crown dependencies: the Bailiwick of Jersey, consisting of Jersey, the largest of the islands; and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, consisting of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and although they are not part of the United Kingdom,  it is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands.  They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198\u00a0km2.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Dartboard Sequence - MathPagesThe Dartboard Sequence [PAR] The Dartboard Sequence [PAR] The arrangement of the numbers around the circumference of a standard  dart board is as shown below         20 1 18 4 13 6 10 15 2 17 3 19 7 16 8 11 14 9 12 5   Oddly enough, no one seems to know for sure how this particular arrangement was selected.  It evidently dates back at least 100 years.  Some say the  pattern was devised by a carpenter named Brian Gamlin in 1896, while others attribute it to someone named Thomas William Buckle in 1913, but both of  these attributions are relatively recent, and neither can be traced back  to a contemporary source.  Also, although it's clear that the numbers are ordered to mix the large and small together, and possibly to separate numerically close values as far as possible (e.g., 20 is far from 19), no  one seems to know of any simple criterion that uniquely singles out this  particular arrangement as the best possible in any quantitative sense.   It may be just an accident of history that this particular arrangement  has been adopted as the standard dart board format.   It's interesting to consider various possible criteria for choosing a  circular arrangement of the first n positive integers.  In order to get  as \"flat\" a distribution as possible, we might try to minimize the  sum of the squares of each k consecutive terms.  For example, setting  k = 3, the standard dard board sequence gives    (20+1+18)^2 + (1+18+4)^2 + (18+4+13)^2 + ... + (5+20+1)^2  =  20478   Apparently the standard board layout described above is called the \"London\" dart board, and there is another, less common, version called the \"Manchester\" dart board, which has the sequence        20 1 16 6 17 8 12 9 14 5 19 2 15 3 18 7 11 10 13 4  for which the sum of squares of each set of three consecutive numbers is 20454, just slightly less than the London arrangement.  In contrast,  if we were to arrange the numbers by just inter-weaving the largest and  smallest numbers like this          20 1 19 2 18 3 17 4 16 5 15 6 14 7 13 8 12 9 11 10     the resulting sum of squares of each 3 consecutive elements is 20510, so the standard dart boards are, in this sense, more flat distributions.   Needless to say, all of these arrangements are much more flat than the  natural monotonic sequence         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   which has a sum of 24350.    By the way, note that if the sum of the squares of every sum of three  consecutive numbers for a given arrangement is S, then we can form another arrangement with the same sum simply by taking the \"21-complement\", i.e.,  subtracting each number from 21. For example, the complement of the  standard London arrangement is        1 20 3 17 8 15 11 6 19 4 18 2 14 5 13 10 7 12 9 16  which has the same sum (20478) as the London arrangement. This works because if we begin with an arrangement a,b,c,d,... having the sum     S = (a+b+c)^2 + (b+c+d)^2 + (c+d+e)^2 + ...  and replace each of the numbers a,b,c,... with 21-a, 21-b, 21-c,... respectively, the sum S' of this complementary arrangement is     S' = [(21-a)+(21-b)+(21-c)]^2 + [(21-b)+(21-c)+(21-d)]^2 + ...        = [63-(a+b+c)]^2 + [63-(b+c+d)]^2 + ...        = S + 20(63)^2 - 2(63)[(a+b+c)+(b+c+d)+...]  Each of the numbers from 1 to 20 appears three times in the summation inside the square brackets in the last term, so that summation equals 630, and hence S' = S.

Please visit our online store and go shopping at the number one imported food delivery service in the USA. England has a rich cheese making history. English cheese is known for its slow aged, intense flavors made from traditional recipes handed down through the generations.  While cheese has been produced in England for thousands of years, today England produces hundreds of varieties of cheeses.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar and Blue Stilton, England's first and second most famous cheeses, have both been given PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status which establishes traditional methods for its production.  English PDO Cheeses must be made with local ingredients within certain geographical locations related to the specific cheese.  PDO protection helps ensure that an English Cheese like Farmhouse Cheddar or Blue Stilton does not stray from original recipes and continues England's time tested cheesemaking traditions. England continues to create new and unique cheese blends such as Cotswold (Double Gloucester with Onions and Chives) and the best-selling English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions. [PAR] Types of English Cheese: [PAR] Cheddar: Cheddar cheese originated the 1100s, perhaps earlier, in the village of Cheddar in southwestern England near the geological feature called Cheddar Gorge. Cheddar Gorge is a series of caves that naturally maintain the ideal conditions (humidity, temperature, etc.) for cheese ripening. In the 1800s, Joseph Harding, known as the modern father of Cheddar Cheese, revolutionized the cheddar cheese making process with advanced technology.  He is responsible for launching the Cheddar cheese making industries of Scotland, Canada, America and Australia.  Today this most famous English Cheese is made throughout the world, but especially in past members of the British Empire.  Cheddar is naturally white or pale yellow in color, the yellow coming from naturally occuring carotene in grass eaten by dairy cows. Darker yellow to orange varieties are produced using a natural food colorant called annatto.  Almost synonymous today with the phrase English Cheese, Cheddar develops a stronger, sharper taste the longer it ages.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar has been given PDO (name protection) status from the EU, requiring that it be produced from the milk within Devon, Dorset, Cornwall or Somerset, England. [PAR] Cheshire: Cheshire is considered to be the original English Cheese. It is firm and crumbly in texture with a mild, slightly salty flavor.  This white, or more typically yellow-orange cheese, again colored by annatto, is great crumbled over salads. It is also delicious with fruit or as a dessert cheese. [PAR] Lancashire: Lancashire is another ancient English Cheese whose history dates back to the 1200s.  It is traditionally made in three varieties based on the cheese's maturity: Creamy, Tasty or Crumbly.  Creamy Lancashire is matured between 4 and 12 weeks, while Tasty is matured from 12 weeks to 24 months.  Crumbly Lancashire was first produced in the 1960s and is usually eaten at 6 to 8 weeks in age.  Crumbly Lancashire is mild and fresh-tasting with a firm, dry and crumbly texture. We sometimes think of it as England's answer to Feta. [PAR] Blue Stilton: Known as the \"The King Of English Cheeses,\" Blue Stilton is a blue-mold English Cheese with a rich and mellow flavor and a smooth and creamy consistency.  Blue Stilton is recognized by its striking blue-green veins, naturally crinkly rind (inedible), complex flavor and crumbly texture. While Blue Stilton is milder than other famous blues of the world like Roquefort and Gorgonzola, it is excellent for crumbling over salads or as a dessert cheese, famously served with a Port Wine. This traditional English Cheese has been awarded PDO status, which maintains that it can only be made in the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire or Leicestershire from locally produced pasteurized milk. [PAR] White Stilton: White Stilton is produced in the same manner as Blue Stilton, without blue mold added to the milk.

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. [PAR] Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623.

The Middle Welsh period is considered to have lasted from then until the 14th century, when the Modern Welsh period began, which in turn divided into Early and Late Modern Welsh.

[PAR] Origins [PAR] Welsh evolved from British, the Celtic language spoken by the ancient Britons. Alternatively classified as Insular Celtic or P-Celtic, it probably arrived in Britain during the Bronze Age or Iron Age and was probably spoken throughout the island south of the Firth of Forth.

[PAR] The Channel Tunnel, often called the Chunnel, is a railway tunnel that lies underneath the water of the English Channel and connects the island of Great Britain with mainland France. The Channel Tunnel , completed in 1994, is considered one of the most amazing engineering feats of the 20th century. [PAR] Dates: Officially opened on May 6, 1994 [PAR] Also Known As: The Chunnel, the Euro Tunnel [PAR] Overview of the Channel Tunnel: [PAR] For centuries, crossing the English Channel via boat or ferry had been considered a miserable task. The often inclement weather and choppy water could make even the most seasoned traveler seasick. It is perhaps not surprising then that as early as 1802 plans were being made for an alternate route across the English Channel. [PAR] Early Plans [PAR] This first plan, made by French engineer Albert Mathieu Favier, called for a tunnel to be dug under the water of the English Channel. This tunnel was to be large enough for horse-drawn carriages to travel through. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Although Favier was able to get the backing of French leader Napoleon Bonaparte , the British rejected Favier's plan. (The British feared, perhaps correctly, that Napoleon wanted to build the tunnel in order to invade England.) [PAR] Over the next two centuries, others created plans to connect Great Britain with France. Despite progress made on a number of these plans, including actual drilling, they all eventually fell through. Sometimes the reason was political discord, other times is was financial problems. Still other times it was Britain's fear of invasion. All of these factors had to be solved before the Channel Tunnel could be built. [PAR] A Contest [PAR] In 1984, French president Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher jointly agreed that a link across the English Channel would be mutually beneficial. However, both governments realized that although the project would create much needed jobs, neither country's government could fund such a massive project. Thus, they decided to hold a contest. [PAR] This contest invited companies to submit their plans to create a link across the English Channel. As part of the contest's requirements, the submitting company was to provide a plan to raise the needed funds to build the project, have the ability to operate the proposed Channel link once the project was completed, and the proposed link must be able to endure for at least 120 years. [PAR] Ten proposals were submitted, including various tunnels and bridges. Some of the proposals were so outlandish in design that they were easily dismissed; others would be so expensive that they were unlikely to ever be completed. The proposal that was accepted was the plan for the Channel Tunnel, submitted by the Balfour Beatty Construction Company (this later became Transmanche Link). [PAR] The Design for the Channel Tunnels [PAR] The Channel Tunnel was to be made up of two, parallel railway tunnels that would be dug under the English Channel. Between these two railway tunnels would run a third, smaller tunnel that would be used for maintenance, including drainage pipes, communication cables, drainage pipes, etc. [PAR] Each of the trains that would run through the Chunnel would be able to hold cars and trucks. This would enable personal vehicles to go through the Channel Tunnel without having individual drivers face such a long, underground drive. [PAR] The plan was expected to cost $3.6 billion. [PAR] Getting Started [PAR] Just getting started on the Channel Tunnel was a monumental task. Funds had to be raised (over 50 large banks gave loans), experienced engineers had to be found, 13,000 skilled and unskilled workers had to be hired and housed, and special tunnel boring machines had to be designed and built.

[PAR] Agatha Christie - An Autobiography [PAR] About Hercule Poirot [PAR] The Beginning [PAR] Hercule Poirot came into existence during World War I. Agatha Christie was working as a VAD in Torquay, and encountered on a daily basis Belgian refugees arriving in England from the continent. Searching for a detective for her first novel, she set upon the idea of creating a Belgian detective who had been \"a former shining light of the Belgian police force\", before being forced out of his country. [PAR] Christie completed The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, but it wasn\u2019t published until four years later. In the novel, Poirot is called upon by his old friend Lieutenant Hastings, who would come to be the Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Christie later wrote that Poirot's introduction to detective fiction was not at all how he himself would have liked. \"Hercule Poirot first,\" he would have said, \"and then a plot to display his remarkable talents to their best advantage.\" [PAR] A Great Man [PAR] Poirot would be the first to call himself a great man - he has never been known for his modesty - but with such success in his career, it is difficult to argue with him. He finishes each case with a dramatic d\u00e9nouement, satisfying his own ego and confirming to all that he is truly \"the greatest mind in Europe.\" His love of elegance, beauty, and precision, as well as his eccentric mannerisms are often ridiculed by the local bumbling policemen, but it is always Poirot who has the last word.

It was locked in a safe until 1974 when it was finally published, earning Poirot a well-deserved obituary in The New York Times; he is the only fictional character to have received such an honour.

[PAR] Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. After completing his undergraduate studies at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II. Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968 he ran again for the presidency and was elected when he defeated Hubert Humphrey. [PAR] Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home.

His administration generally transferred power from Washington to the states. He imposed wage and price controls for a period of ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was reelected by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history in 1972, when he defeated George McGovern.

The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In retirement, Nixon's work writing several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.

[PAR] Released 4/14/2014 [PAR] Herpes Zoster in People Who Received Varicella Vaccine [PAR] Herpes zoster, also known as zoster and shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). [PAR] Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Once the illness resolves, the virus remains dormant (latent) in the dorsal root ganglia. VZV can reactive later in a person\u2019s life and cause a painful, maculopapular rash called herpes zoster. [PAR] Anyone who has had varicella or gotten varicella vaccine can develop herpes zoster. Most people typically have only one episode of herpes zoster in their lifetime. However, second and even third episodes are possible. [PAR] Clinical Features [PAR] People with herpes zoster most commonly have a rash in one or two adjacent dermatomes (localized zoster). The rash most commonly appears on the trunk along a thoracic dermatome. The rash does not usually cross the body\u2019s midline. However, approximately 20% of people have rash that overlaps adjacent dermatomes. Less commonly, the rash can be more widespread and affect three or more dermatomes. This condition is called disseminated zoster. This generally occurs only in people with compromised or suppressed immune systems. Disseminated zoster can be difficult to distinguish from varicella. [PAR] The rash is usually painful, itchy or tingly. These symptoms may precede rash onset by days to weeks. Some people may also have headache, photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), and malaise in the prodromal phase. [PAR] The rash develops into clusters of clear vesicles. New vesicles continue to form over three to five days and progressively dry and crust over. They usually heal in two to four weeks. There may be permanent pigmentation changes and scarring on the skin. [PAR] Complications [PAR] Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster. It is a persistent pain in the area where the rash once was. PHN is diagnosed in people who have pain that persists after their rash has resolved. Some define PHN as any duration of pain after the rash resolves; others define it as duration of pain for more than 30 days, or for more than 90 days after rash onset. PHN can last for weeks or months and occasionally, for many years. [PAR] A person's risk of having PHN after herpes zoster increases with age. Older adults are more likely to have PHN and to have longer lasting and more severe pain. Approximately 13% (and possibly more) of people 60 years of age and older with herpes zoster will get PHN. PHN is rare in people younger than 40 years old. Other predictors of PHN include the level of pain a person has when they have the rash and the size of their rash.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] How the Channel Tunnel Was Built and DesignedHow the Channel Tunnel Was Built and Designed [PAR] Updated December 04, 2015. [PAR] What Is the Channel Tunnel? [PAR] The Channel Tunnel, often called the Chunnel, is a railway tunnel that lies underneath the water of the English Channel and connects the island of Great Britain with mainland France. The Channel Tunnel , completed in 1994, is considered one of the most amazing engineering feats of the 20th century. [PAR] Dates: Officially opened on May 6, 1994 [PAR] Also Known As: The Chunnel, the Euro Tunnel [PAR] Overview of the Channel Tunnel: [PAR] For centuries, crossing the English Channel via boat or ferry had been considered a miserable task. The often inclement weather and choppy water could make even the most seasoned traveler seasick. It is perhaps not surprising then that as early as 1802 plans were being made for an alternate route across the English Channel. [PAR] Early Plans [PAR] This first plan, made by French engineer Albert Mathieu Favier, called for a tunnel to be dug under the water of the English Channel. This tunnel was to be large enough for horse-drawn carriages to travel through. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Although Favier was able to get the backing of French leader Napoleon Bonaparte , the British rejected Favier's plan. (The British feared, perhaps correctly, that Napoleon wanted to build the tunnel in order to invade England.) [PAR] Over the next two centuries, others created plans to connect Great Britain with France. Despite progress made on a number of these plans, including actual drilling, they all eventually fell through. Sometimes the reason was political discord, other times is was financial problems. Still other times it was Britain's fear of invasion. All of these factors had to be solved before the Channel Tunnel could be built. [PAR] A Contest [PAR] In 1984, French president Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher jointly agreed that a link across the English Channel would be mutually beneficial. However, both governments realized that although the project would create much needed jobs, neither country's government could fund such a massive project. Thus, they decided to hold a contest. [PAR] This contest invited companies to submit their plans to create a link across the English Channel. As part of the contest's requirements, the submitting company was to provide a plan to raise the needed funds to build the project, have the ability to operate the proposed Channel link once the project was completed, and the proposed link must be able to endure for at least 120 years. [PAR] Ten proposals were submitted, including various tunnels and bridges. Some of the proposals were so outlandish in design that they were easily dismissed; others would be so expensive that they were unlikely to ever be completed. The proposal that was accepted was the plan for the Channel Tunnel, submitted by the Balfour Beatty Construction Company (this later became Transmanche Link). [PAR] The Design for the Channel Tunnels [PAR] The Channel Tunnel was to be made up of two, parallel railway tunnels that would be dug under the English Channel. Between these two railway tunnels would run a third, smaller tunnel that would be used for maintenance, including drainage pipes, communication cables, drainage pipes, etc. [PAR] Each of the trains that would run through the Chunnel would be able to hold cars and trucks. This would enable personal vehicles to go through the Channel Tunnel without having individual drivers face such a long, underground drive. [PAR] The plan was expected to cost $3.6 billion. [PAR] Getting Started [PAR] Just getting started on the Channel Tunnel was a monumental task. Funds had to be raised (over 50 large banks gave loans), experienced engineers had to be found, 13,000 skilled and unskilled workers had to be hired and housed, and special tunnel boring machines had to be designed and built. [PAR] As these things were getting done, the designers had to determine exactly where the tunnel was to be dug. Specifically, the geology of the bottom of the English Channel had to be carefully examined. It was determined that although the bottom was made of a thick layer of chalk, the Lower", "topic": "The geological considerations that influenced the selection of the tunnel's route, specifically the composition of the English Channel seabed.", "question": "Considering the geological composition of the English Channel seabed as described in the text, what primary characteristic of the dominant material facilitated the feasibility of the Channel Tunnel project?", "answer": "Relative ease of boring.", "explanation": "The text states the seabed is primarily chalk.
