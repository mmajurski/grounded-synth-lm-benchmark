{"context": "## 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed.

{"context": "## 6.1. False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine.

It has proven to be very scalable and is commonly\n\ndeployed in the enterprise environment (corporations, universities, schools, etc.)\n\nActive Directory relies upon the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for its communications. While AD is\n\nprobably the largest deployed user of LDAP other implementations for various operating systems exist, including Apple\n\nOpenDirectory, RH Directory Server, and OpenLDAP. LDAP is often used by internal applications and process.\n\nThe cornerstone of an AD environment is the Domain Controller (DC). DCs stores directory information about Users,\n\nGroups, Computers, Policies, and more. They respond to auth requests for the domain (network) they are supporting. A\n\nstandard network will have multiple DCs with fail-over in place in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor many environments, AD is the mechanism used for authentication, authorization, and accounting. As many services have\n\nmigrated to the web, the need to access AD from anywhere has become increasingly important. This has kindled the growth\n\nof Azure Active Directory, a cloud-based version of active directory. Increasingly we are seeing deployments that\n\nutilize cloud-based resources instead of local DCs.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.2.

However, since containers share the same kernel, a vulnerability in namespace isolation or cgroup enforcement can allow malicious containers to access or disrupt others, posing significant security risks.", "question_token_count": 37, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 7, "question_groundedness_score": 9, "avg_answer_token_count": 40, "choices": null}
{"context": "### 10.1.2. Containers {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__containers}\nA container simplifies the VM by using the same operating system kernel as the host. This is accomplished by using\n\nspecial features of the Linux kernel to isolate the container. [Linux\n\nnamespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html){.link} controlled by\n\n[cgroups](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html){.link} allow a daemon (Docker, podman, etc.) to make an\n\nenvironment where the application has limited access to the full system. Typically containers are used to run a single\n\napplication as if it were running all by itself on an actual host. This makes it easier to deploy the unique\n\nenvironments that some applications require.\n\nThe obvious security concern lies in the isolation. What happens if a container has access to another containers\n\nresources? Given that containers for rival companies may be running next to each other on the same machine in the cloud,\n\nwhat are the risks of having a malicious container access or disrupt another?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"10.1.3.

MitB {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mitb}\nMitB stands for man in the browser and is typically caused by a trojan installing malware that allows the attacker to\n\nintercept/modify communications between the browser and the server.

{"context": "## 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash.

Since the MAC to IP\n\naddress table is cached in several places, it can take a long time for all the caches to invalidate and resolve an issue\n\ncaused by malicious ARP frames.\n\nThere is a protocol designed to mitigate the issues with ARP. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) reaches across layers to work\n\nwith the DHCP lease database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a DHCP lease was granted.\n\nWhile this can solve many of the issues associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure higher-level\n\nprotocols such as HTTPS just in case.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.1.2.

A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers.

The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard.

{"context": "### 4.2.2. ICMP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__icmp}\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is largely used to send messages between systems when IP doesn't work. For\n\nexample, lets say we tried to connect to a host but our router doesn't know how to get there. Our router can send us an\n\nICMP *Destination Unreachable* message to let us know that something is going wrong. Because ICMP messages work at the\n\nnetwork layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue with the internet layer.\n\nThe most common use for ICMP is the `ping`{.literal} command. `ping`{.literal} sends an ICMP echo request to check to\n\nsee if a host is up.

Example `traceroute`{.literal} output is shown below:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n\n 1  ryan.njitdm.campus.njit.edu (172.24.80.1)  0.217 ms  0.200 ms  0.252 ms\n\n 2  ROOter.lan (192.168.2.1)  5.790 ms  5.765 ms  6.275 ms\n\n 3  * * * \u2460\n\n 4  B4307.NWRKNJ-LCR-21.verizon-gni.net (130.81.27.166)  19.166 ms  19.144 ms  21.097 ms\n\n 5  * * * \u2460\n\n 6  0.ae1.GW7.EWR6.ALTER.NET (140.222.2.227)  12.376 ms  14.634 ms 0.ae2.GW7.EWR6.ALTER.NET (140.222.2.229)  9.805 ms\n\n 7  209.85.149.208 (209.85.149.208)  9.782 ms  10.331 ms  9.192 ms\n\n 8  * * * \u2460\n\n 9  dns.google (8.8.8.8)  11.313 ms  9.761 ms  9.758 ms</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* Notice these routers not responding to ICMP packets\n\n:::\n\nDespite the usefulness of ICMP, ICMP packets from external sources are often ignored.

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).

{"context": "## 1.6. Tools of the Trade {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tools_of_the_trade}\nWith all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the question remains, \\\"What can be done?\\\" There\n\nare a few tools the security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture including: *user\n\nawareness*, *anti-malware software*, *backups*, and *encryption*.\n\n::: description-list\n\n[User Awareness]{.term}\n\n:   [A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform\n\n    other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure. While a backup does not solve the problem of the data being\n\n    sold or used by others, it does allow for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a security\n\n    plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Encryption]{.term}\n\n:   [At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to make it useful. Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key. Often,\n\n    encryption and backups complement each other and fill in the use cases that each lacks individually. As such,\n\n    encryption will show up multiple times and in multiple ways in an average security plan.]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.7.

{"context": "### 4.4.14. FTP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ftp}\nFile Transfer Protocol is a relatively simple, text-based protocol for sending files between machines. FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect.

{"context": "## Remote Shells\n::: content\n\nAs you have hopefully experienced by completing the labs, Linux systems traditionally have a powerful shell system that\n\nuses text commands to control the OS. Through the shell you can create, read, update, or delete files, make network\n\nconnections, configure kernel parameters, install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells that\n\ncan be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an\n\nattacker would need to have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is being able to interact\n\nwith a shell remotely on the exploited machine.\n\nIn this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect. In these instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out\n\nfrom the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the inside*. This is more compatible with the\n\nfirewalls/NAT routers that sit between most devices and the Internet.\n\nIn either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote connection allows an attacker to basically do\n\nanything they want. To that end, many tools have sprung up to provide remote shell access. A machine may already have a\n\nremote shell tool installed, such as an SSH server.

Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted.

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).

{"context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.

One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one.

{"context": "## Sony Rootkit\n::: content\n\nIn 2005 Sony released CDs for their music software with an application rootkit designed to run on Microsoft Windows\n\nsystems. The rootkit ran persistently in the background, slowing systems, and did not have an uninstaller to remove the\n\nprogram. It was designed to prevent the OS from copying information from audio CDs, but it also opened up several\n\nsecurity holes that could be exploited by other malware. Ultimately the rootkit led to several class-action lawsuits\n\nagainst Sony BMG and a led to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that required Sony to reimburse customers\n\nwho reported damages from the rootkit.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"3.3.6.

These hosts may be desktop computers, servers, or\n\neven internet of things (IoT) devices. Botnets are often used in large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS)\n\nattacks where the nature of the attack is to have many machines flooding a single machine with traffic. Botnets may also\n\nbe used to send spam emails as their access to SMTP email relay may vary depending on their internet service provider\n\n(ISP).\n\nBots are typically controlled through a command and control (C2, C&C) server. While this C2 server may use a custom\n\nprotocol, it is far more typical for modern botnets to rely on other infrastructure. C2 traffic can use SSH, HTTP,\n\nInternet Relay Chat (IRC), or even Discord to send commands to bots and receive data from bots.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"3.3.7.

The Smurf attack is an early\n\ntype of Distributed Denial of Service attack. An attacker would create an ICMP echo request with the victims IP address\n\nas the source address. This echo request would be directed at a broadcast IP address for a subnet. Many of the clients\n\non the subnet would respond the echo request, flooding the victim with responses. The asymmetric nature of this attack,\n\na single packet prompting possibly hundreds of responses, made it particularly hard to deal with. Using a Smurf attack,\n\nan attacker could keep a victim *pinned down* with minimal bandwidth required on their end. Modern clients no longer\n\nrespond to ICMP echo requests directed at the broadcast, mitigating the risk of this kind of attack.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"5.4.

This broadcast-based amplification combined with IP spoofing allows a single packet to generate many responses, overwhelming the victim. This reveals a fundamental vulnerability because the protocols were designed for diagnostic convenience without consideration for malicious amplification, and network configurations that allow ICMP replies to broadcasts further enable the attack.", "question_token_count": 43, "answer_correctness_score": 9, "explanation_validity_score": 9, "question_clarity_score": 8, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 56, "choices": null}
