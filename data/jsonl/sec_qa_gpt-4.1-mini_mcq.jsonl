Compliance {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__compliance}\nBoth business and legal standards have been established to ensure that all parts of the information security CIA triad\n\nare protected. Taking measures to follow these standards is known as *compliance*. This section will outline the details\n\nof many important policies and businesses comply with.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.2.1. Compliance Tools\"}\n\n\n### 8.2.1. Compliance Tools {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__compliance_tools}\nIn order to determine if systems are in compliance, compliance audits are performed. These may be automated, and may be\n\nas simple as endpoint software that periodically scans machines. They may be as complex as having an outside team\n\nperform penetration testing on a particular site. In either case, compliance audits are looking for situations that\n\nviolate security policies.\n\n*Risk assessment* is an important part of compliance that determines just how damaging one of the violations discovered\n\nmay be. Risk analysis reports are often generated as a second step in a compliance audit. These reports help the company\n\nmake an informed decision as to what actions should be taken.\n\nLastly *change controls* are used to ensure that changes that need to happen are put in place and to track down changes\n\nthat led to the violations of the security policies. By keeping track of how and why a system changes and requiring\n\napprovals systems can more from an insecure state to a secure one and hopefully stay that way. Change controls should be\n\nfound in all facets of cybersecurity work.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.2.2.

{"context": "## 2.8. Stream Ciphers {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__stream_ciphers}\nStream ciphers encode data one symbol at a time and produces one ciphertext symbol for each cleartext symbol. Given that\n\nyou can often use some sort of block encryption with a significantly small block size, stream encryption is not used as\n\noften. Technically the OTP example, when used one symbol at a time, is a stream cipher. The keys come in one symbol at a\n\ntime, the cleartext comes in one symbol at a time, and an operation is performed (addition in the case of the example)\n\nto create the ciphertext. Given a suitable keysize and a well-researched algorithm, stream ciphers can be just as secure\n\nas block ciphers. That being said a stream cipher is usually more consistent in its runtime characteristics and\n\ntypically consumes less memory Unfortunately there are not as many well-researched algorithms and widely used stream\n\nciphers.\n\n:::\n\n::::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.9.

It is very\n\npopular and there are many secure algorithms to choose from. Unfortunately if the input data doesn't fit neatly into\n\nblocks of the same size, padding may be required, which takes up more space/memory and reduces the speed of the cipher.\n\nAs such the block encryption is often less performant than stream encryption.\n\n:::::::::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"2.9.1.

SQL Injection {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__sql_injection}\nAs mentioned in the SSRF section, almost all web systems are supported by other servers running internally.

Many different groups offer IAM frameworks, the most famous of which may be Amazon Web Systems (AWS) which\n\nuse it for controlling access to the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) technologies they offer.\n\nIAM often makes use of PIM and PAM to accomplish these goals.

Unix File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__unix_file_permissions}\nFrom its inception, Unix was designed to be a multi-user environment, and as such, a lot of attention was paid to file\n\npermissions. Every file in a Unix system has an owner and a group. Each file also has permissions for owner, group, and\n\nall users. Permissions are set using octal numbers where each bit represents read (bit 0: 1), write (bit 1: 2), or\n\nexecute (bit 2: 4) permission.\n\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/permissions.svg\" alt=\"permissions\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nFor example, if you wanted a read and execute permission the number would be 5 (1 + 4). Read and write permission would\n\nbe 3 (1 + 2).\n\nPermissions are specified with the `chmod`{.literal} command, the first octal number is the permissions for the owner,\n\nthe second is for the group, and the third is for all user. So to change a file to have read, write, and execute\n\npermissions for the owner, read permissions for the group, and no permissions for everyone else, the command would be\n\n`chmod 710 <filename>`{.literal} where `<filename>`{.literal} is the name of your file.\n\nThe owner and group of a file can be set with the `chown`{.literal} command:\n\n`chown <owner>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. If `<group>`{.literal} is not specified only the owner is changed.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.6.

There is often a lot of overlap between solutions and while that may seem inefficient in other fields,\n\nin cybersecurity we consider it a benefit. By using multiple solutions, sometimes referred to as multi-layered security\n\nor defense in depth, you can build a more robust protection against breaches.\n\nLet's take a look at an example to see how layered security can help mitigate the effects of a real-world attack. Assume\n\nan SOC is supporting a web application on self-hosted machines. A malicious actor wishes to exfiltrate data from the web\n\napplication. They begin by testing to see if SQL several different SQL injection attacks yield any results.\n\nA well designed web application should sanitize its inputs and may prevent the queries from making it to the database.\n\nSimilarly an alert team may notice a sudden uptick in SQL queries, far beyond the usual baseline for the application. An\n\nIDS (Intrusion Detection System) may flag the queries as known SQL injection attacks. Assuming the attack makes it past\n\nthe application, team, and the IDS, it is possible that the database user is configured according to the principle of\n\nleast privilege and the queries will not be executed due to a lack of permissions.\n\nAs you can see, any one of these layers may be fail, but by having multiple layers the chance of an attack occurring is\n\ngreatly diminished.\n\n:::\n\n:::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.3.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network.

These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2.

Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering.

When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes.

The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).

Symmetric Encryption {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__symmetric_encryption}\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/symmetric.svg\" width=\"550\" alt=\"symmetric\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSymmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand in that it only uses a single key (in this case\n\nour key is labelled \\'A\\') to encrypt or decrypt data. Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7.

{"context": "## Remote Shells\n::: content\n\nAs you have hopefully experienced by completing the labs, Linux systems traditionally have a powerful shell system that\n\nuses text commands to control the OS. Through the shell you can create, read, update, or delete files, make network\n\nconnections, configure kernel parameters, install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells that\n\ncan be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an\n\nattacker would need to have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is being able to interact\n\nwith a shell remotely on the exploited machine.\n\nIn this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect. In these instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out\n\nfrom the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the inside*. This is more compatible with the\n\nfirewalls/NAT routers that sit between most devices and the Internet.\n\nIn either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote connection allows an attacker to basically do\n\nanything they want.
