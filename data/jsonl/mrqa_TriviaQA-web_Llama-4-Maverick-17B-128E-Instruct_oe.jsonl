{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] ColorColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, blue, yellow, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates. [PAR] Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance. [PAR] The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light). [PAR] Physics of color  [PAR] Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\". [PAR] Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called metamers of the color in question. [PAR] Spectral colors  [PAR] The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum \u2013 named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671 \u2013 include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see refractive index). [PAR] The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list \u2013 the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to perceive colors in the same way ). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today we call cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported at the time.  [PAR] The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive-green. [PAR] Color of objects  [PAR] The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contribute to the color.

When Virginia\u2019s troops were transferred to the Confederate service, he became, on May 14, 1861, a brigadier general, the highest rank then authorized. Soon after he was promoted to full general. [PAR] Lee\u2019s first field command was in the western part of the state, where he failed to hold back invading Union forces in an area of strong pro-Union sentiment. He was recalled to Richmond, and from March 1862 he was military adviser to President Davis. From this position he was able to influence some operations, notably those of General Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson in his Shenandoah Valley campaign. [PAR] When General Joseph E. Johnston was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, Lee took command of what became the Army of Northern Virginia. He successfully repulsed the efforts of Union general George McClellan in the Peninsular campaign, concluding with the Battles of Seven Days: Oak Grove, Mechanicsville, Gaine\u2019s Mill, Garnett\u2019s and Golding\u2019s Farms, Savage\u2019s Station and Allen\u2019s Farm, White Oak Swamp, and Malvern Hill. Victories were won through Lee\u2019s aggressiveness and daring in the face of McClellan\u2019s timidity rather than by any comprehensive generalship on Lee\u2019s part, for he was unable to exercise control over his subordinate commanders, and the individual battles could be considered tactical defeats.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] MinnesotaMinnesota (; locally ) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The name comes from the Dakota word for \"clear blue water\".  Owing to its large number of lakes, the state is informally known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    [PAR] Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. [PAR] Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non-native inhabitants. A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland. Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many first working in iron mines. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, Somalia, and Latin America has broadened the state's historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota has America's largest Somali population.  Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: Mnisota. The root mni (also spelled mini or minne) means \"water\" and \"t\u014d\" (\"ta\") means \"blue\".  Mnisota can be translated as clear blue water or clouded blue water depending on pronunciation.   Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it mnisota. Many places in the state have similar names, such as Minnehaha Falls (\"laughing water\" (waterfall)), Minneiska (\"white water\"), Minneota (\"much water\"), Minnetonka (\"big water\"), Minnetrista (\"crooked water\"), and Minneapolis, a combination of mni and polis, the Greek word for \"city\".  [PAR] Geography [PAR] Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state is part of the U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north.

There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe.

For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity.

[PAR] Bureau of Reclamation [PAR] Grand  Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River west of Spokane, Washington, is one of the  largest structures ever built by mankind--a mass of concrete standing 550 feet  high and 5,223 feet long, or just shy of a mile. Grand Coulee contains 12 million cubic yards  of concrete, or enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami. More massive than the Great Pyramid of Giza, Grand  Coulee is listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven  civil engineering wonders of the United States. Grand Coulee's reservoir,  Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, stretches 150  miles north, almost to the Canadian border. [PAR] A concrete gravity dam, Grand Coulee took  eight years to build, employed thousands of men during the Great Depression and,  when completed in 1942, provided the enormous electrical power necessary to  make aluminum, so essential for World War II production of planes and ships. It was  Grand Coulee, as well, that powered the production of plutonium at the nearby  Hanford Site, which figured prominently in the making of the atomic bomb. [PAR] So  grand was Grand Coulee Dam that in 1941 folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote \u201cThe  Song of the Grand Coulee Dam\u201d (though he was paid to do so under contract with  the Bonneville Power Administration.) \u201cBiggest  thing built by the hand of a Man,\u201d Guthrie sang. \u201cPower that sings, boys, turbines that whine.  Waters back up the Canadian Line.\u201d [PAR] Appropriate  as the word grand is for the dam, the  name Grand Coulee actually refers to a  unique geological feature created thousands of years ago when Ice Age glaciers  blocked the ancient riverbed of the Columbia River. When water eventually traveled under the ice  dam, great floods scoured out hundreds of miles of deep gulches, or coulees, in  the Columbia River Basin. One of these, the Grand  Coulee, is four miles wide and bordered on three sides by steep cliffs. [PAR] A local  proposal to dam the Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee dated to 1918, but  the idea faced strong competition from another proposal that called for an  irrigation canal to be built from the Pend Oreille River in northern Idaho. Proponents of this latter \u201cgravity plan\u201d argued that the hydroelectricity generated from the dam was not needed. Many studies followed, including one by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which took Grand Coulee\u2019s side, recommending a high dam  at the site and the pumping of irrigation water up to the surrounding  countryside. [PAR] This recommendation took hold with the Bureau  of Reclamation, which was promoting construction of multiple-use dams, through  which the production of hydroelectric power could produce revenue to help repay the construction cost of a project. (The Reclamation Act requires that beneficiaries of a project repay those costs, and a multi-purpose project reduced the payment burden on irrigators.) The recommendation found  traction with the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in a  time of great dust bowls and economic depression. Roosevelt launched federal program after  federal program in an attempt to spur the economy by \u201cpriming the pump\u201d and  providing jobs for out-of-work Americans.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south.

Please visit our online store and go shopping at the number one imported food delivery service in the USA. England has a rich cheese making history. English cheese is known for its slow aged, intense flavors made from traditional recipes handed down through the generations.  While cheese has been produced in England for thousands of years, today England produces hundreds of varieties of cheeses.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar and Blue Stilton, England's first and second most famous cheeses, have both been given PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status which establishes traditional methods for its production.  English PDO Cheeses must be made with local ingredients within certain geographical locations related to the specific cheese.  PDO protection helps ensure that an English Cheese like Farmhouse Cheddar or Blue Stilton does not stray from original recipes and continues England's time tested cheesemaking traditions. England continues to create new and unique cheese blends such as Cotswold (Double Gloucester with Onions and Chives) and the best-selling English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions. [PAR] Types of English Cheese: [PAR] Cheddar: Cheddar cheese originated the 1100s, perhaps earlier, in the village of Cheddar in southwestern England near the geological feature called Cheddar Gorge. Cheddar Gorge is a series of caves that naturally maintain the ideal conditions (humidity, temperature, etc.) for cheese ripening. In the 1800s, Joseph Harding, known as the modern father of Cheddar Cheese, revolutionized the cheddar cheese making process with advanced technology.  He is responsible for launching the Cheddar cheese making industries of Scotland, Canada, America and Australia.  Today this most famous English Cheese is made throughout the world, but especially in past members of the British Empire.  Cheddar is naturally white or pale yellow in color, the yellow coming from naturally occuring carotene in grass eaten by dairy cows. Darker yellow to orange varieties are produced using a natural food colorant called annatto.  Almost synonymous today with the phrase English Cheese, Cheddar develops a stronger, sharper taste the longer it ages.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar has been given PDO (name protection) status from the EU, requiring that it be produced from the milk within Devon, Dorset, Cornwall or Somerset, England. [PAR] Cheshire: Cheshire is considered to be the original English Cheese. It is firm and crumbly in texture with a mild, slightly salty flavor.  This white, or more typically yellow-orange cheese, again colored by annatto, is great crumbled over salads. It is also delicious with fruit or as a dessert cheese. [PAR] Lancashire: Lancashire is another ancient English Cheese whose history dates back to the 1200s.  It is traditionally made in three varieties based on the cheese's maturity: Creamy, Tasty or Crumbly.  Creamy Lancashire is matured between 4 and 12 weeks, while Tasty is matured from 12 weeks to 24 months.  Crumbly Lancashire was first produced in the 1960s and is usually eaten at 6 to 8 weeks in age.  Crumbly Lancashire is mild and fresh-tasting with a firm, dry and crumbly texture. We sometimes think of it as England's answer to Feta. [PAR] Blue Stilton: Known as the \"The King Of English Cheeses,\" Blue Stilton is a blue-mold English Cheese with a rich and mellow flavor and a smooth and creamy consistency.  Blue Stilton is recognized by its striking blue-green veins, naturally crinkly rind (inedible), complex flavor and crumbly texture. While Blue Stilton is milder than other famous blues of the world like Roquefort and Gorgonzola, it is excellent for crumbling over salads or as a dessert cheese, famously served with a Port Wine. This traditional English Cheese has been awarded PDO status, which maintains that it can only be made in the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire or Leicestershire from locally produced pasteurized milk.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] ColorColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, blue, yellow, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates. [PAR] Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance. [PAR] The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light). [PAR] Physics of color  [PAR] Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\". [PAR] Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called metamers of the color in question. [PAR] Spectral colors  [PAR] The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum \u2013 named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671 \u2013 include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see refractive index). [PAR] The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list \u2013 the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to perceive colors in the same way ). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today we call cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported at the time.  [PAR] The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive-green. [PAR] Color of objects  [PAR] The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contribute to the color.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] David CameronDavid William Donald Cameron (; born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016. He was the Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016, and has been Member of Parliament for Witney since 2001. Cameron identifies as a One-Nation Conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. [PAR] Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.  It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage. [PAR] Internationally, his government militarily intervened in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured a majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as Prime Minister leading a Conservative government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he chose to resign to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.  [PAR] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for reining in the United Kingdom's national debt. Conversely, he has been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of political opportunism and social elitism. Cameron appeared on the Forbes List of The World's Most Powerful People from 2010.  [PAR] Family [PAR] Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010), a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur,  Mount (born 1934), a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.  Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962. The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".  [PAR] Cameron was born in Marylebone, London,  and raised in Peasemore, Berkshire.  He has a brother, Alexander Cameron, QC (born 1963), a barrister,  and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).  [PAR] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;  Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,  who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.  [PAR] Cameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh.

Attempted to shake-off his \"Red Ed\" tag by talking about the \"squeezed middle\" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. [PAR] He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on \"refounding\" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. [PAR] The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. [PAR] ED BALLS - SHADOW CHANCELLOR [PAR] As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44 , became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. [PAR] YVETTE COOPER - SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITIES [PAR] Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. [PAR] DOUGLAS ALEXANDER - SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY [PAR] The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43 , he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson.

His adult works include Tales of the Unexpected. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Childhood  [PAR] Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (n\u00e9e Hesselberg).  Dahl's father had emigrated to the UK from Sarpsborg, Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s. His mother came over and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild and Else. Dahl and his sisters were raised in the Lutheran faith, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff, where their parents worshipped.  [PAR] In 1920, when Dahl was three years old, his seven-year-old sister, Astri, died from appendicitis. Weeks later, his father died of pneumonia at the age of 57. With the option of returning to Norway to live with relatives, Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales, because Harald had wished to have their children educated in British schools, which he considered the world's best.  [PAR] Dahl first attended the Cathedral School, Llandaff. At the age of eight, he and four of his friends (one named Thwaites) were caned by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of gobstoppers at the local sweet shop, which was owned by a \"mean and loathsome\" old woman called Mrs Pratchett. This was known among the five boys as the \"Great Mouse Plot of 1924\".  A favourite sweet among British schoolboys between the two World Wars, Dahl would later refer to gobstoppers in his literary creation, Everlasting Gobstopper.  [PAR] Thereafter, he transferred to a boarding school in England: St Peter's in Weston-super-Mare. Roald's parents had wanted him to be educated at an English public school and, because of a then regular ferry link across the Bristol Channel, this proved to be the nearest. His time at St Peter's was an unpleasant experience for him. He was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed to her his unhappiness. Only after her death in 1967 did he find out that she had saved every single one of his letters, in small bundles held together with green tape.  In 2016, to mark the centenary of Dahl's birth, his letters to his mother were abridged and broadcast as BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] MinnesotaMinnesota (; locally ) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The name comes from the Dakota word for \"clear blue water\".  Owing to its large number of lakes, the state is informally known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    [PAR] Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. [PAR] Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non-native inhabitants. A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland. Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many first working in iron mines. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, Somalia, and Latin America has broadened the state's historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota has America's largest Somali population.  Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: Mnisota.

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism. [PAR] Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election. [PAR] On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her re-election in 1983. [PAR] Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire, which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. After a series of small strokes in 2002, she was advised to withdraw from public speaking. Despite this, she managed to prerecord a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death, which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004.  In 2013, she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] ColorColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, blue, yellow, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates. [PAR] Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance. [PAR] The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light). [PAR] Physics of color  [PAR] Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\". [PAR] Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called metamers of the color in question. [PAR] Spectral colors  [PAR] The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum \u2013 named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671 \u2013 include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see refractive index). [PAR] The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list \u2013 the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to perceive colors in the same way ). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today we call cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported at the time.  [PAR] The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive-green. [PAR] Color of objects  [PAR] The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing.

As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. [PAR] Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College. His first of many books, The Naval War of 1812 (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the American West and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders, where he gained national fame for courage during the Spanish\u2013American War. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president as McKinley's running mate in the election of 1900. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley's re-election in a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism. [PAR] Following the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, succeeded to the office, becoming the youngest United States President in history. Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era, he championed his \"Square Deal\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Making conservation a top priority, he established a myriad of new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. [PAR] Elected in 1904 to a full term, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, William Howard Taft, to succeed him in the presidency. After leaving office, Roosevelt went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor. He tried but failed to win the presidential nomination in 1912. Roosevelt founded his own party, the Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split among Republicans enabled the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in 1912. The Democrats in the South had also gained power by having disenfranchised most blacks (and Republicans) from the political system from 1890 to 1908, fatally weakening the Republican Party across the region, and creating a Solid South dominated by their party alone.

We hope you find them useful. [PAR] Object of the Chess Game [PAR] It's rather simple, there are two players with one player having 16 black or dark color chess pieces and the other player having 16 white or light color chess pieces. The chess players move on a square chessboard made up of 64 individual squares consisting of 32 dark squares and 32 light squares. Each chess piece has a defined starting point or square with the dark chess pieces aligned on one side of the board and the light pieces on the other. There are 6 different types of chess pieces, each with it's own unique method to move on the chessboard. The chess pieces are used to both attack and defend from attack, against the other players chessmen. Each player has one chess piece called the king. The ultimate objective of the game is to capture the opponents king. Having said this, the king will never actually be captured. When either sides king is trapped to where it cannot move without being taken, it's called \"checkmate\" or the shortened version \"mate\". At this point, the game is over. The object of playing chess is really quite simple, but mastering this game of chess is a totally different story. [PAR] Chess Board Setup [PAR] Now that you have a basic concept for the object of the chess game, the next step is to get the the chessboard and chess pieces setup according to the rules of playing chess. Lets start with the chess pieces. The 16 chess pieces are made up of 1 King, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks, and 8 pawns. From the following diagram, you can identify the pieces and the general character of their shape and appearance and also the location or square the chess pieces start from according to the chess rules. Now the chessboard. The correct orientation, as per the chess rules, is with a black square on your left side as facing the chess board. One of the more common mistakes in setting up the chess board is reversing the king and queen chess pieces. Remember, as per the chess rules, the queen is always on her own color while the king is always on the opposite color.

[PAR] Chess piece - King [PAR] Having a king is mandatory even though he's pretty much worthless and really nothing more than a mere figure-head. But that's the rule of chess, like it or not, you have to have a king. The king is always the tallest piece on the chessboard and the king chess piece will usually have a cross-like object on top.\u00a0 By the rules of chess, his moves are pretty limited, he can only move one square at a time but he can move forward,\u00a0 backward, left, right and diagonally.\u00a0 Not to offer any particular strategy, but keep him safe and well protected! [PAR] Chess piece - Queen [PAR] Unlike the king, the queen is no figure-head. She's the most powerful chess piece you have on the chessboard.\u00a0 The queen usually looks like a queen in the sense that she'll have a crown, sometimes with nice sharp points.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] New ZealandNew Zealand () is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses \u2013 that of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu \u2013 and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. [PAR] Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand, and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture. In 1642, Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, became the first European to sight New Zealand.  In 1840, representatives of the British Crown and M\u0101ori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, making New Zealand a British colony. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.7 million is of European descent; the indigenous M\u0101ori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from M\u0101ori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant. [PAR] New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy. New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom and quality of life. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently John Key. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt, supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America.  In 1645, Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland.   British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand. [PAR] Aotearoa (often translated as \"land of the long white cloud\") is the current M\u0101ori name for New Zealand. It is unknown whether M\u0101ori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans, with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island. M\u0101ori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui (the fish of M\u0101ui) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) or Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki) for the South Island. Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island) and South (Stewart Island / Rakiura).  In 1830, maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907, this was the accepted norm.  The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013.  This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu.", "topic": "The development and significance of the M\u0101ori culture in New Zealand's history and identity.", "question": "What role did the Treaty of Waitangi play in shaping the contemporary relationship between the M\u0101ori people and the New Zealand government, and how has it impacted the preservation and promotion of M\u0101ori culture?", "answer": "The Treaty of Waitangi shaped the contemporary relationship by establishing a legal and moral framework for the government's interaction with M\u0101ori, impacting the preservation and promotion of M\u0101ori culture through recognition of M\u0101ori rights and cultural heritage.", "explanation": "The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840, was a foundational document that established New Zealand as a British colony.

Though the origins of curling are unclear, most people regard Scotland as curling\u2019s birthplace. Today, curling is played around the world, largely thanks to its introduction into the Olympics in 1988. Because curling can seem complicated if you don\u2019t know a lot about it, these articles help to explain the basics, from curling terminology and the roles of each position on a team, to how scoring and other elements of the game work, and why curling is such a great sport to play. [PAR] Curling Match Terminology [PAR] Curling, probably more than any other sport, has its own unique terminology (like hurry hard and burning a rock, among others). Here are the key curling words and phrases you need to know to blend in at your next bonspiel: [PAR] Blank end: An end where no points are scored. [PAR] Bonspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete. [PAR] Burning a rock: A rules infraction that happens when a player touches a stone as it\u2019s traveling down the sheet. [PAR] Button: The very center of the target rings or house. [PAR] Cashspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete for money. [PAR] Delivery: The action of throwing a stone to the other end of the playing surface. [PAR] Eight-ender: A perfect end where every one of the team\u2019s stones scores a point. [PAR] End: The way a curling game is divided. An end is like an inning in a baseball game. A curling game has either eight or ten ends. [PAR] Gripper: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you keep your footing on the ice. See slider. [PAR] Hammer: The last rock of the end. [PAR] Hack: The foothold in the ice you use to push off from when you deliver the stone. [PAR] House: Also known as the rings, this is the name of the giant bull\u2019s eye at either end of the sheet of ice. It consists of a set of concentric circles, called the 12-foot, 8-foot, 4-foot, and the Button. [PAR] Hurry hard: A directive given to sweepers by the skip or third, to begin sweeping. [PAR] Rink: A curling team; also the name of a curling facility [PAR] Rock: Also known as a stone, the granite playing utensil that a curler delivers. Regular-sized rocks weigh approximately 44 pounds. [PAR] Sheet: The frozen playing surface on which the game is played. [PAR] Slider: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you move or slide along the ice. [PAR] Tee line: The line on the playing surface that runs through the middle of the house. [PAR] Weight: The amount of force used to deliver a stone. [PAR] The Members of a Curling Team [PAR] In curling, the team you play on is called a rink. The rink is made up of four players: the lead, the second, the third (also called the vice, vice-skip, or mate), and the skip. Each player has specific duties: [PAR] Lead: The lead throws the first two rocks of the end and then sweeps the next six. The lead must be very good at throwing guards and a strong sweeper. [PAR] Second: The second throws the third and fourth stones of the end and should be strong at playing takeouts. The second sweeps the first two stones and then the final four of the end. The second and the lead need to be in sync when sweeping together. [PAR] Third: The third (or mate or vice), who throws the fifth and sixth rocks of the end, must be good at all shots, but especially draws. It is the third\u2019s job to set up the shots that will be thrown by the skip, and to help the skip discuss the strategy of the final two stones of the end.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Romulus and Remus - Ancient History EncyclopediaRomulus and Remus - Ancient History Encyclopedia [PAR] Romulus and Remus [PAR] by Brittany Garcia [PAR] published on 04 October 2013 [PAR] In Roman mythology , Romulus and his twin brother Remus were the children of Rhea Silvia and Mars (or in some variations the demi-god hero Hercules ). Romulus and Remus are best known for being the founders of the city of Rome . Their story is recorded by many authors including Virgil who claims their birth and adventures were fated in order for Rome to be founded. [PAR] The Birth & Parentage of Romulus & Remus [PAR] Romulus and Remus were the direct descendants of Aeneas, whose fate-driven adventures to discover Italy are described by Virgil in The Aeneid . Romulus and Remus were related to Aeneas through their mother's father, Numitor. Numitor was a king of Alba Longa, an ancient city of Latium in central Italy, and father to Rhea Silvia. Before Romulus' and Remus' conception, Numitor's reign was usurped by Nimitor's younger brother, Amulius. Amulius inherited control over Alba Longa's treasury with which he was able to dethrone Numitor and become king. Amulius, wishing to avoid any conflict of power, killed Nimitor's male heirs and forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin . Vestal Virgins were priestesses of Vesta , patron goddess of the hearth; they were charged with keeping a sacred fire that was never to be extinguished and to take vows of chastity. [PAR] Remove Ads [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] There is much debate and variation as to whom was the father of Romulus and Remus. Some myths claim that Mars appeared and lay with Rhea Silvia; other myths attest that the demi-god hero Hercules was her partner. However, the author Livy claims that Rhea Silvia was in fact raped by an unknown man, but blamed her pregnancy on divine conception. In either case, Rhea Silvia was discovered to be pregnant and gave birth to her sons. It was custom that any Vestal Virgin betraying her vows of celibacy was condemned to death; the most common death sentence was to be buried alive. However, King Amulius, fearing the wrath of the paternal god (Mars or Hercules) did not wish to directly stain his hands with the mother's and children's blood. So, King Amulius imprisoned Rhea Silvia and ordered the twins' death by means of live burial , exposure, or being thrown into the Tiber River. He reasoned that if the twins were to die not by the sword but by the elements, he and his city would be saved from punishment by the gods. He ordered a servant to carry out the death sentence, but in every scenario of this myth, the servant takes pity on the twins and spares their lives. The servant, then, places the twins into a basket onto the River Tiber, and the river carries the boys to safety. [PAR] The twins were first discovered by a she-wolf or lupa, who suckled them, and they were fed by a wood-pecker or picus. [PAR] The Discovery of Romulus & Remus [PAR] The river god Tibernus ensured their safety by calming the river, and he caused their basket to catch in the roots of a nearby fig tree. The tree was located at the base of the Palatine Hill in the Velabrum swamp. The twins were first discovered by a she-wolf or lupa, who suckled them and they were fed by a wood-pecker or picus. Eventually, they were discovered and cared for by a shepherd and his wife: Faustulus and Acca Larentia.The two boys grew up to be shepherds like their adoptive father. One day while they were herding their sheep, they were met by shepherds of King Amulius. These shepherds started a fight with Romulus and Remus in which Remus was captured and taken before King Amulius. Romulus gathered and incited a band of local shepherds to join him in rescuing his brother. King Amulius believed that Rhea Silvia's children were dead; he did not recognize Remus or Romulus.

The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.\u00a0 Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.\u00a0 The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.\u00a0 The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley\" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.\u00a0 He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real. But he did have fun playing in the clouds. He made Sir Basil suffer when he shot his tail off, as he pretended to be dead. Poor Sir Basil didn't know what to do, so as usual shouted for Lady Rosemary, who saw Parsley was faking it. His best friend is Dill the dog and both of them seem to get themselves into trouble. But once in a while Parsley does come up with a good idea, such as the time he persuaded Pashana Bedhi to use his snake charming skills to float Sage and his nest back in the tree. \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley with a tail for doing jobs of every kind but I mustn't treat it roughly or too harshly for it's such a useful thing to have behind\" His songs are: \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I am always very glad to see you wave but please don't shout or speak to me too harshly because I'm not particularly brave\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I really don't like climbing things at all so please don't shout or speak to me too harshly I am sure you wouldn't want to see me fall\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I'm supposed to pull this rope and ring the bell though I try to pull it gently never harshly I'm afraid that I'm not doing very well\" \"For today I", "topic": "The main premise and setting of \"The Herbs\" TV show.", "question": "What is the significance of the magic word \"Herbidacious\" in the context of accessing the magical herb garden in \"The Herbs\" TV show?", "answer": "It grants access to the magical herb garden.", "explanation": "The magic word \"Herbidacious\" is significant because it serves as the key to accessing the magical herb garden, a central setting for the show's adventures and narrative.", "question_token_count": 32, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 6, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 10, "choices": null}
{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Prime Minister of CanadaThe Prime Minister of Canada () is the primary minister of the Crown, chairman of the Cabinet, and thus head of government for Canada, charged with advising the Canadian monarch or federal viceroy on the exercise of the executive powers vested in them by the constitution.  Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists only as per long-established convention (originating in Canada's former colonial power, the United Kingdom) that stipulates the monarch's representative, the governor general, must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable (), a privilege maintained for life. [PAR] The current, and 23rd, Prime Minister of Canada is the Liberal Party's Justin Trudeau, who was appointed on November 4, 2015, by Governor General David Johnston, following the general election that took place that year. [PAR] Origin of the office [PAR] The position of prime minister is not outlined in any Canadian constitutional document and is mentioned only in passing in the Constitution Act, 1982,   and the Letters Patent, 1947 issued by King George VI.  The office and its functions are instead governed by constitutional conventions and modelled on the same office in the United Kingdom. [PAR] Qualifications and selection [PAR] The prime minister, along with the other ministers in cabinet, is appointed by the governor general on behalf of the monarch. However, by the conventions of responsible government, designed to maintain administrative stability, the viceroy will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support, or confidence, of a majority of the directly-elected members of the House of Commons;  as a practical matter, this is often the leader of a party whose members form a majority, or a very large plurality, of Members of Parliament (MPs).  There are no age or citizenship restrictions on the position of prime minister itself. [PAR] While there is no legal requirement for the prime minister to be a member of parliament, for practical and political reasons the prime minister is expected to win a seat very promptly.  However, in rare circumstances individuals who are not sitting members of the House of Commons have been appointed to the position of prime minister. Two former prime ministers\u2014Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell\u2014served in the 1890s while members of the Senate. Both, in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate, succeeded prime ministers who had died in office\u2014John A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894. That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario. [PAR] Prime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible.  For example, William Lyon Mackenzie King, after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election (that his party won), briefly \"governed from the hallway\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)The Speaker of the House of Commons is the presiding officer of the House of Commons, the United Kingdom's lower chamber of Parliament. The office is currently held by John Bercow, who was initially elected on 22 June 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin. He was returned as an MP in the 2010 general election and was re-elected as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2010. He was again returned as an MP in the 2015 general election and was re-elected, unopposed, as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2015.  [PAR] The Speaker presides over the House's debates, determining which members may speak. The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries, the Speaker remains strictly non-partisan, and renounces all affiliation with his or her former political party when taking office as well as when leaving the office. The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to Speaker Denison's rule). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions, and remains a constituency Member of Parliament (MP). The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker's House at the Palace of Westminster.  [PAR] History [PAR] The office of Speaker is almost as old as Parliament itself. The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258, when Peter de Montfort presided over the Parliament held in Oxford. Early presiding officers were known by the title parlour or prolocutor. The continuous history of the office of Speaker is held to date from 1376  when Sir Peter de la Mare spoke for the commons in the \"Good Parliament\" as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of the Crown and the most unpopular members of the king's household. Edward III was frail and in seclusion, his prestigious eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, terminally ill. It was left to the next son, a furious John of Gaunt, to fight back. He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics. In the next, \"Bad Parliament\", in 1377, a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt's steward, Thomas Hungerford, as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors' misdoings of the previous year. Gaunt evidently wanted a 'mirror-image' as his form of counter-coup and this notion, born in crisis, of one 'speaker', who quickly also became 'chairman' and organiser of the Commons' business, was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376-7. [PAR] On 6 October 1399, Sir John Cheyne of Beckford (Gloucester) was elected speaker. The powerful Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne's reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years. [PAR] Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament, with at least one contested election known, in 1420 (Roger Hunt prevailing by a majority of just four votes), in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted, indicating that the famous 'defence of the Commons' privilege' should not be seen in isolation as the principal thread in the office's evolution. Whilst the idea of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons' role, the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house's business and responses to the Crown's agenda, much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted.

He is a pompous, blustering figure with overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager, and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He believes in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. He is class conscious and a snob, considering himself upper-middle class and looking down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. His pretensions stand in contrast to Wilson , who is genuinely Upper Middle Class, Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's having attending public school, believing it made him 'wet', while his own state-school background is an attribute. Mainwaring and Wilson's relationship is mainly based on the fact that Mainwaring has always had to struggle and fight for everything in his life, whereas Wilson has just sat back and let it all come to him, (despite being a strong autocrat, Mainwaring fully believes that people should work and earn everything they get in life). Mainwaring is prudish and repressed, and can be judgemental about people who do not share his moral outlook. [PAR] Mainwaring [PAR] Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those he considers beneath him, and his arrogance is frequently punctured by circumstance and the people around him, such as Arthur Wilson , his chief clerk with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship, and Private Walker , a black-marketeer who interjects during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefitting from underhanded deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not, and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. [PAR] As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he is barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, and his plans result in chaos. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain of World War I. (In World War II, John Le Mesurier who played Wilson, had been a Captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major). He did, however, serve in the army of occupation in France, \"during the whole of 1919 \u2014 somebody had to clear up the mess.\" (He tried to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight; Arthur Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to World War II but was also rejected with poor eyesight.) [PAR] Despite his shortcomings as a leader, Mainwaring considers himself an excellent military tactician. His height and background is frequently demonstrated to show a Napoleon Complex; he is frequently referred to as 'Napoleon' by his nemesis Hodges . In one episode, A Soldier's Farewell , Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte , and is thwarted at the Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington looking like Wilson. His pomposity and conviction of his prowess see Mainwaring yearn to be in control of any situation, and he behaves in an arrogant manner; this is demonstrated by the first episode, in which he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience or qualifications (and had to wait until the episode Room at the Bottom before he received his commission). [PAR] In Command Decision he was prepared to relinquish control so the platoon could gain rifles, arguing defence of the country was more important than his ego. In addition he was prepared to \"march in the ranks as Private Mainwaring\" when he was briefly de-commissioned. This implied he was more overzealous than a control freak. [PAR] Mainwaring's patriotism can lead to xenophobia (he is not keen on the French because they are emotional, the Russians because their communism, and the Germans and the Italians because of them being such deadly enemies).

[PAR] The Football League, also known as the npower Football League for sponsorship reasons, is a league competition featuring professional association football clubs from England and Wales. [PAR] Founded in 1888, it is the oldest such competition in world football. It was the top level football league in England from its foundation until 1992. [PAR] Since 1995 it has had 72 clubs evenly divided into three divisions, which are currently known as The Championship, League One and League Two. Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest placed clubs in the Premier League. [PAR] A director of Aston Villa, William McGregor, was the first to set out to bring some order to a chaotic world where clubs arranged their own fixtures. On March 2, 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. [PAR] The first meeting was held at Anderson's Hotel in London on March 23, 1888, on the eve of the FA Cup Final. The Football League was formally created and named in Manchester at a further meeting on April 17 at the Royal Hotel. [PAR] In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League to take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal and on May 27, 1992, the Premier League as we know it today was formed. [PAR] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. [PAR] There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions. [PAR] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon. [PAR] A total of 43 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992 until the end of the 2009/10 season. Two other clubs (Luton Town and Notts County) were signatories to the original agreement that created the Premier League, but were relegated prior to the inaugural Premier League season and have not subsequently returned to the top flight. [PAR] Seven clubs have been members of the Premier League for every season since its inception. This group is composed of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Music Note Values - Essential Music TheoryMusic Note Values [PAR] Music Note Values [PAR] Each music note written on the stave has a duration (length) as well as pitch. It is the design of the note that tells you its duration, in the same way as the position on the staff tells you the pitch. So each music note on a stave gives  you two pieces of information, pitch and duration. This page focuses on  the duration of each note.

This is  known as a Double Whole note in the US. The double whole note (breve)  divides into 2 whole notes (semibreves) following the pattern of the  other notes in the Rhythm Tree. The Double Whole note (Breve) is  therefore worth 8 quarter notes (crotchets). The Double Whole note  (Breve) fell out of use as smaller value notes were invented by  composers. It can be notated as an open rectangle or a whole note with  bars either side. Click here to read more about the double whole note (breve) and how our modern system of music notation developed. Make sure you  have a few spare moments though as once you start reading the history of  the music note it's difficult to stop! [PAR] Whole Note (Semibreve) [PAR] The Whole note is the longest music note in general use today. It is an  open note with no stem. I always say to my students it looks like a  hole\u2026so it is easy to remember! The duration of the whole note is 4  quarter notes. [PAR] Half Note (Minim) [PAR] The Half note duration is 2 quarter notes. It differs from the whole  note in that it has a stem, although it is still open. For students I  liken this stem to the line in the middle of the \u00bd. This also helps them  remember that 1 half note is worth 2 beats (in 4/4 timing, which is  what they are usually working in when learning this). [PAR] Quarter Note (Crotchet) [PAR] The quarter note has become the  de facto standard 1 beat music note.  This has happened as the 4/4 time signature is the most popular (with  3/4 and 2/4 following close behind) and quarter notes have a duration of  1 in these time signatures. It is also roughly in the middle of the  most used notes in the Rhythm Tree ,  making the quarter note the ideal candidate for ensuring whole notes  don't become too long to count, and shorter, popular notes such as  eighth and sixteenth notes aren't impossible to count in terms of them  being fractions of a note. The quarter note changes from the half note  as it is filled in, as opposed to empty. [PAR] Eighth Note (Quaver) [PAR] The eighth note is worth \u00bd of a Quarter note. It may also be considered  as a one beat note in 3/8 and similar timings, the 8 on the bottom of  the time signature giving the clue that you are counting in eighth  notes. This is the first note in the rhythm tree to have a flag.  The flag is the name for the 'tail' added to the eighth note. Eighth  notes may be a single as shown on the left, or joined together with beams. [PAR] It is common to see eighth notes joined into sets of 2 to make one beat.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson.

Titov made 17 orbits and spent more than 25 hours in space. [PAR] To Soviet propagandists, the Soviet conquest of space was evidence of the supremacy of communism over capitalism. However, to those who worked on the Vostok program and earlier on Sputnik (which launched the first satellite into space in 1957), the successes were attributable chiefly to the brilliance of one man: Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Because of his controversial past, Chief Designer Korolev was unknown in the West and to all but insiders in the USSR until his death in 1966. [PAR] Born in the Ukraine in 1906, Korolev was part of a scientific team that launched the first Soviet liquid-fueled rocket in 1933. In 1938, his military sponsor fell prey to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges, and Korolev and his colleagues were also put on trial. Convicted of treason and sabotage, Korolev was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. The Soviet authorities came to fear German rocket advances, however, and after only a year Korolev was put in charge of a prison design bureau and ordered to continue his rocketry work. [PAR] In 1945, Korolev was sent to Germany to learn about the V-2 rocket, which had been used to devastating effect by the Nazis against the British. The Americans had captured the rocket\u2019s designer, Wernher von Braun, who later became head of the U.S. space program, but the Soviets acquired a fair amount of V-2 resources, including rockets, launch facilities, blueprints, and a few German V-2 technicians. By employing this technology and his own considerable engineering talents, by 1954 Korolev had built a rocket that could carry a five-ton nuclear warhead and in 1957 launched the first intercontinental ballistic missile. [PAR] That year, Korolev\u2019s plan to launch a satellite into space was approved, and on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 was fired into Earth\u2019s orbit. It was the first Soviet victory of the space race, and Korolev, still technically a prisoner, was officially rehabilitated. The Soviet space program under Korolev would go on to numerous space firsts in the late 1950s and early \u201960s: first animal in orbit, first large scientific satellite, first man, first woman, first three men, first space walk, first spacecraft to impact the moon, first to orbit the moon, first to impact Venus, and first craft to soft-land on the moon. Throughout this time, Korolev remained anonymous, known only as the \u201cChief Designer.\u201d His dream of sending cosmonauts to the moon eventually ended in failure, primarily because the Soviet lunar program received just one-tenth the funding allocated to America\u2019s successful Apollo lunar landing", "topic": "The details and technological aspects of the Vostok 1 spacecraft that enabled Gagarin's historic flight.", "question": "What was notable about the guidance system of the Vostok 1 spacecraft during Yuri Gagarin's historic flight?", "answer": "It was entirely automatic.", "explanation": "The Vostok 1 spacecraft was guided entirely by an automatic control system during its flight, marking a significant technological achievement.", "question_token_count": 24, "answer_correctness_score": 10, "explanation_validity_score": 10, "question_clarity_score": 9, "question_groundedness_score": 10, "avg_answer_token_count": 6, "choices": null}

George Washington , whose headquarters were nearby. The flag had 13 horizontal stripes (probably of red and white or of red, white, and blue) and, in the canton, the first version of the British Union Flag ( Union Jack ). It was used at forts and on naval vessels. Another popular early flag, that of the Sons of Liberty , had the 13 stripes only. The various 18th-century \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flags had only local significance, but in the 20th century such designs were popularized by political protesters. [PAR] The first official national flag, formally approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, was the Stars and Stripes. The blue canton was to contain 13 stars, but the layout of the stars was left undefined, and several patterns are known. The designer of the flag, Congressman Francis Hopkinson , may have had a ring of stars in mind to symbolize (in the words of the flag law) \u201ca new constellation.\u201d Today that pattern is popularly known as the \u201c Betsy Ross flag,\u201d although the claims of her descendants that she made the first Stars and Stripes and that she used the ring pattern are unsubstantiated. Rows of stars (4-5-4 or 3-2-3-2-3) were common, but other variations also existed. The new Stars and Stripes formed part of the military colours carried on Sept. 11, 1777, at the Battle of the Brandywine , perhaps its first such use. [PAR] Similar Topics [PAR] flag of the Confederate States of America [PAR] The Stars and Stripes changed on May 1, 1795, when two more stars and two more stripes were added to reflect the admission to the union of Vermont (1791) and Kentucky (1792).

In 1818, after five more states had been admitted, Congress enacted legislation pertaining to a new flag, requiring that henceforth the number of stripes should remain 13, the number of stars should always match the number of states, and any new star should be added on the July 4 following a state\u2019s admission. This has been the system ever since. In all, from 1777 to 1960 (after the admission of Hawaii in 1959) there were 27 versions of the flag\u201425 involving changes in the stars only.

[PAR] Pink Marble: A piece of pink marble about four inches (ten centimeters) across. The pink color is most likely derived from iron. Image by NASA. [PAR] What is Marble? [PAR] Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism.  It is composed primarily of the mineral calcite (CaCO3) and usually contains other minerals, such as clay minerals, micas, quartz , pyrite , iron oxides, and graphite . Under the conditions of metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone recrystallizes to form a rock that is a mass of interlocking calcite crystals. A related rock, dolomitic marble, is produced when dolostone is subjected to heat and pressure.

This specimen is a piece of white marble with a large red ruby crystal from Afghanistan. Specimen is about 1 1/4 inches across (about 3 centimeters). Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] How Does Marble Form? [PAR] Most marble forms at convergent plate boundaries where large areas of Earth's crust are exposed to regional metamorphism.  Some marble also forms by contact metamorphism when a hot magma body heats adjacent limestone or dolostone. [PAR] Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris.   During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes.  In the early stages of the  limestone-to-marble transformation, the calcite crystals in the rock are very small.  In a freshly-broken hand  specimen, they might only be recognized as a sugary sparkle of light reflecting from their tiny cleavage faces when the rock is played in the light. [PAR] As metamorphism progresses, the crystals grow larger and become easily recognizable as interlocking crystals of calcite.   Recrystallization obscures the original fossils and sedimentary structures of the limestone. It also occurs without forming  foliation, which normally is found in rocks that are altered by the directed pressure of a convergent plate boundary. [PAR] Recrystallization is what marks the separation between limestone and marble.  Marble that has been exposed to low levels of metamorphism will have very small calcite crystals.  The crystals become larger as the level of metamorphism progresses. Clay minerals within the marble will alter to micas and more complex silicate structures as the level of metamorphism increases. [PAR] Marble Dimension Stone: Marble cut into blocks and slabs of specific size is known as \"dimension stone.\"  Photo \u00a9 iStockphoto / Thomas Lehmann. [PAR] Physical Properties and Uses of Marble [PAR] Marble occurs in large deposits that can be hundreds of feet thick and geographically extensive.  This allows it to be  economically mined on a large scale, with some mines and quarries producing millions of tons per year. [PAR] Most marble is made into either crushed stone or dimension stone. Crushed stone is used as an aggregate in highways, railroad beds, building foundations, and other types of construction. Dimension stone is produced by sawing marble into  pieces of specific dimensions.   These are used in monuments, buildings, sculptures, paving and other projects.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Family GuyFamily Guy is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture. [PAR] The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series, with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005. [PAR] Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons. [PAR] Many tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation. [PAR] A spin-off series, The Cleveland Show, featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. \"The Simpsons Guy\", a crossover episode with The Simpsons, aired on September 28, 2014.  Family Guy is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.  In 2013, TV Guide ranked Family Guy the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.  [PAR] As of May 15, 2016, Family Guy was renewed for a fifteenth season.  [PAR] Premise [PAR] Characters [PAR] The show revolves around the adventures of the Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, a bumbling yet well-intentioned blue-collar worker; Lois, a stay-at-home mother and piano teacher who is a member of the wealthy Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their awkward teenage daughter who is constantly ridiculed and ignored by the family; Chris, their teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and a younger version of his father in many respects; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is their witty, smoking, martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic dog Brian, though he is still considered a pet in many respects.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Washington (state)Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States located north of Oregon, west of Idaho, and south of the Canadian province of British Columbia on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Named after George Washington, the first President of the United States, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which had been ceded by Britain in 1846 in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon Boundary Dispute.  It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital.  Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State or the State of Washington to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington. [PAR] Washington is the 18th largest with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people.  Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west, mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast and far southeast, and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.  Mount Rainier is the state's highest elevation at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 m). [PAR] Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. [PAR] Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The Washington Territory was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The area was originally part of a region called the Columbia District after the Columbia River. Incidentally, the area was renamed Washington in order to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, which contains the city of Washington.  [PAR] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president. To distinguish it from the U.S. capital, which is also named for George Washington, Washington is sometimes referred to as \"Washington State\", or, in more formal contexts, as \"the State of Washington\". Washingtonians and other residents of the Pacific Northwest refer to the state simply as \"Washington\", calling the nation's capital \"Washington, D.C.\" or, more often, simply \"D.C.\". [PAR] Geography [PAR] Washington is the northwestern-most state of the contiguous United States. Its northern border lies mostly along the 49th parallel, and then via marine boundaries through the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait and Strait of Juan de Fuca, with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. Washington is bordered by Oregon to the south, with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the southern boundary. [PAR] To the east, Washington borders Idaho, bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the confluence of the Snake River and Clearwater River (about 116\u00b057' west), except for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River.

Their coalition was re-elected by a landslide following the Armistice.  Law persuaded the Conservatives to end the coalition, and work as an independent party. Conservative withdrawal forced Lloyd George to resign. The King then invited Law to form a new administration in 1922. Law's 'Tranquility Manifesto' was an attempt to allow Britain to recover from war damage. Though elected, he lasted just 209 days in office. He resigned in May 1923 due to ill health. [PAR] Stanley Baldwin, Conservative Prime Minister from 1923, 1924-9, 1935-7, played a leading part in a Conservative rebellion which overthrew the coalition government and the premiership of Lloyd George. In Bonar Law's Conservative government he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. When Bonar Law retired through illness in May 1923, Baldwin became prime minister. Determined to help reduce unemployment, in November he called a general election to seek support for a policy of trade protection. Failing to retain a majority, his government resigned in January 1924. Its replacement, the first Labour government also lacked an overall majority, and after it was defeated in another general election in October 1924, Baldwin returned as prime minister. [PAR] James Ramsay MacDonald, Labour Prime Minister from 1924 and 1929-35, became chairman of the parliamentary Labour group in 1911. As the Labour Party grew, however, he was criticised as being too moderate. His opposition to the Great War made him more unpopular still. In 1924 was asked by George V to form a government when Stanley Baldwin's small Conservative majority proved ungovernable. In his second minority government in 1929, the economic crises, including the doubling of unemployment levels, persuaded him to include the opposition leaders in a cross-party National Government. [PAR] During the 1931 financial and political crisis, Baldwin contributed to the formation of a 'National' coalition government, led by the former Labour prime minister, MacDonald. As Lord President of the Council, Baldwin at first sought to promote international disarmament, warning of the difficulty of defence against air attack: 'the bomber will always get through'. But as the threat from Nazi Germany became obvious, he accepted the need for rearmament and introduced new defence programmes each year from 1934 to 1937, against Labour and Liberal opposition. [PAR] Baldwin became prime minister of the National government in June 1935. In the autumn he won a general election, promising to continue to strengthen national defences. When seeking to avoid war with Mussolini's Italy over Abyssinia in order to focus effort against Hitler's Germany, his Cabinet was embarrassed by premature disclosure of a compromise settlement ('the Hore-Laval pact'). In retrospect the National Government's policy of combining armed deterrence with efforts to bind Hitler and Mussolini into a general European settlement seemed insufficient, and after the Second World War broke out in 1939 Baldwin became a leading target for those - especially Churchill - who thought more could have been done to accelerate rearmament and prevent war. [PAR] Neville Chamberlain, Conservative Prime Minister from 1937-40,  succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister in May 1937. War was brewing in Europe, and had already exploded in Spain. Chamberlain was unwilling to go down in history as responsible for an inevitably destructive war without doing everything possible to prevent it. Neville Chamberlain, as with many in Europe who had witnessed the horrors of the First World War and its aftermath, was committed to peace at almost any price. Chamberlain famously met German chancellor Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938 the result of which was an agreement that Britain and Germany would never again go to war. \"I believe,\" he declared on his return to the UK, \"it is peace for our time.\" However, the success of 'appeasement' was shortlived, as Hitler occupied Prague the following year.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Lord Peter WimseyLord Peter Death  Bredon Wimsey is the fictional protagonist in a series of detective novels and short stories by Dorothy L. Sayers (and their continuation by Jill Paton Walsh) in which he solves mysteries\u2014usually murders. A dilettante who solves mysteries for his own amusement, Wimsey is an archetype for the British gentleman detective. Lord Peter is often assisted by his valet and former batman Mervyn Bunter, his good friend and later brother-in-law  Inspector/Chief Inspector Charles \"Parker Bird\" Parker, and later by his future wife Harriet Vane. [PAR] Born in the year 1890 and aging in real time, Wimsey is described as being of average height, with straw-coloured hair, a beaked nose, and a vaguely foolish face. Reputedly his looks were patterned after those of academic and poet Roy Ridley, whom Sayers briefly met in a relationship after witnessing him read his Newdigate Prize-winning poem \"Oxford\" at the Encaenia ceremony in July 1913. He also possessed considerable intelligence and athletic ability, evidenced by his playing cricket for Oxford University while earning a First. He created a spectacularly successful publicity campaign for Whifflet cigarettes while working for Pym's Publicity Ltd, and at age 40 was able to turn three cartwheels in the office corridor, stopping just short of the boss's open office door (Murder Must Advertise). [PAR] Among Lord Peter's hobbies, in addition to criminology, is collecting incunabula, books from the earliest days of printing. He is an expert on matters of food (especially wine), male fashion, and classical music. He excels at the piano, including Bach's works for keyboard instruments. One of Lord Peter's cars is a 12-cylinder (\"double-six\") 1927 Daimler four-seater, which (like all his cars) he calls \"Mrs Merdle\" after a character in Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit who \"hated fuss\". [PAR] Biography [PAR] Background [PAR] Lord Peter Wimsey's (fictional) ancestry begins with the 12th-century knight Gerald de Wimsey, who went with King Richard The Lion Heart on the Third Crusade and took part in the Siege of Acre.  This makes the Wimseys an unusually ancient family, since \"Very few English noble families go that far in the first creation; rebellions and monarchic head choppings had seen to that\" (as reviewer Janet Hitchman noted in the introduction to Striding Folly). The family coat of arms is blazoned as \"Sable, 3 mice courant, argent; crest, a domestic cat couched as to spring, proper\". The family motto, displayed under its coat of arms, is \"As my Whimsy takes me.\"  [PAR] Early life [PAR] Lord Peter was the second of the three children of Mortimer Wimsey, 15th Duke of Denver, and Honoria Lucasta Delagardie, who lives on throughout the novels as the Dowager Duchess of Denver. The Dowager Duchess is witty and intelligent, and strongly supports her younger son, whom she plainly prefers over his less intelligent, more conventional older brother, Gerald, the 16th Duke. Gerald's snobbish wife, Helen, who detests Wimsey, and their devil-may-care heir, Viscount St. George (Wimsey's nephew, who likes him), also make appearances in the novels. So does Lady Mary, the younger sister of the Duke and Lord Peter, who  leans strongly to the political left and scandalizes her family by marrying a policeman of working class origins. [PAR] Lord Peter Wimsey is called \"Lord\" by courtesy as the son of a Duke. He is not a peer and has no right to sit in the House of Lords, nor does this courtesy usage pass on to any offspring he may have. [PAR] As a boy, the young Peter Wimsey was, to the great distress of his father, strongly attached to an old, smelly poacher living at the edge of the family estate.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Last of the Summer WineLast of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke that was originally broadcast on the BBC. Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series.

Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). [PAR] States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. [PAR] States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  [PAR] States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. [PAR] States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state.  [PAR] The Constitution grants to Congress  the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. [PAR] The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw from) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v.

[PAR] In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.  [PAR] Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066\u20131154,  Plantagenet 1154\u20131485,  Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of  1649\u20131660).

Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558\u20131603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World.

Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the  execution of Charles I in 1649.

He has virtually no emotional life, or at least no awareness of it, and his comments are strictly factual. Indeed, sometimes his obsession with the facts of navigation, for example, becomes unbearable for us, as his fictional editor, Richard Sympson, makes clear when he explains having had to cut out nearly half of Gulliver\u2019s verbiage.

However, the farmer puts Gulliver on display around Brobdingnag, which clearly shows that he would rather profit from his discovery than converse with him as an equal. His exploitation of Gulliver as a laborer, which nearly starves Gulliver to death, seems less cruel than simpleminded. Generally, the farmer represents the average Brobdingnagian of no great gifts or intelligence, wielding an extraordinary power over Gulliver simply by virtue of his immense size.

When the queen discovers that no one at court is suited to care for Gulliver, she invites Glumdalclitch to live at court as his sole babysitter, a function she performs with great seriousness and attentiveness.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] OtterOtter is a common name for a carnivorous mammal in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the weasel family Mustelidae, which also includes badgers, honey badgers, martens, minks, polecats, weasels and wolverines. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This, and cognate words in other Indo-European languages, ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European language root *w\u00f3dr\u0325, which also gave rise to the English word \"water\".   [PAR] Terminology [PAR] An otter's den is called a holt or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars, females are called bitches or sows, and their offspring are called pups.  The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp (being descriptive of their often playful nature) or, when in water, raft.   [PAR] The feces of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish;[http://archive.today/20120908081151/http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm Spraint Analysis]. ottersite.btinternet.co.uk these are known as spraints.  [PAR] Life cycle [PAR] The gestation period in otters is about 60 to 86 days.  The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog and older offspring.  Bitch otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years.  The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland.  It is lined with moss and grass. [PAR] After one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim.  The pup lives with its family for approximately one year.  Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups.  Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds. [PAR] Characteristics [PAR] Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from  in length and 1 to in weight. The Oriental small-clawed otter is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water. [PAR] Several otter species live in cold waters and have high metabolic rates to help keep them warm. European otters must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and sea otters 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as 10 \u00b0C, an otter needs to catch 100 g of fish per hour to survive. Most species hunt for three to five hours each day and nursing mothers up to eight hours each day. [PAR] For most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, crayfish and crabs.  Some otters are expert at opening shellfish, and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of clams, sea urchins and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their stomachs. This skill must be learned by the young.  [PAR] Otters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged.

There they encountered William Shaw, headmaster of Bowes Academy,        in whose school several boys had died or went blind from mistreatment and        neglect. [PAR] Visiting a cemetery in the area Dickens found the graves of many of the        students of these schools and one in particular Dickens said \"put Smike        into my head\". Smike was the abused inmate of Dotheboys Hall, the fictional        school he based on Shaw's Bowes Academy in Nicholas Nickleby. The        fictional headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, Wackford Squeers, was based on William        Shaw. [PAR] The ignorance of the schoolmaster Squeers is more than a comic exaggeration.

In the preface to the Cheap Edition              of Nicholas Nickleby in 1848 Dickens claimed that the brothers              were based on real persons \"with whom I never interchanged any communication              in my life\".

The journey towards choosing our own national anthem was no exception. [PAR] The move to replace God Save the Queen with an anthem unique to Australia began as early as the 1820s. Over the decades, public opinion has been constantly canvassed and numerous competitions held to find a suitable song. [PAR] Peter Dodds McCormick's Advance Australia Fair was officially declared Australia's national anthem by the Governor-General on 19 April 1984, close to 160 years after the first alternative anthems were put forward.

[PAR] Review [PAR] The Wire: The Complete First Season [PAR] After one episode of The Wire you'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of  its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series'  remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American  masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter  from The Baltimore Sun who cowrote the book that inspired TV's Homicide ,  and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable  street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece to The Corner )  that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on  institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil  police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price  (especially Clockers), the series opens as maverick Detective  Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a  vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's  deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a  haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex  investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance. [PAR] The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so  breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to  life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description.  Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the  unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson,  helmer of The Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to  the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable,  complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention, The Wire is \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy  answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate  in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the  cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to  the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving  you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in  season 2. --Jeff Shannon [PAR] The Wire: The Complete Second Season [PAR] It hardly seems possible, but The Wire's second season is even better than the first .  The \"visual novel\" concept of this masterful HBO series is taken even  further in a rich, labyrinthine plot revolving around the longshoremen  of Baltimore's struggling cargo docks, where corruption, smuggling, and  murder draw the attention of detective McNulty (Dominic West). What  follows is a series of events which at first seem unrelated (including  13 bodies found in a cargo container), and then the ongoing effort to  topple the drug empire of \"Stringer\" Bell (Idris Elba) and the  imprisoned Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris), whose business is suffering  from short supply, high demand, and disruption of distribution. The  dutiful diligence of a Marine Police Patrol Officer and the moral  outrage of the longshoremen's union leader are also factored into the  suspicious goings-on at the loading docks, and what unfolds in these 12  episodes is an American crime epic easily on par with the Godfather saga.

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus.

In 1917, 18-year-old Al Capone went to work for Yale at the Harvard Inn as a bartender and as a waiter and bouncer when needed. Capone watched and learned as Yale used violence to maintain control over his empire. [PAR] One day while working at the Harvard Inn, Capone saw a man and woman sitting at a table. After his initial advances were ignored, Capone went up to the good-looking woman and whispered in her ear, \"Honey, you have a nice ass and I mean that as a compliment.\" The man with her was her brother, Frank Gallucio. [PAR] Defending his sister's honor, Gallucio punched Capone. However, Capone didn't let it end there; he decided to fight back. Gallucio then took out a knife and slashed at Capone's face, managing to cut Capone's left cheek three times (one of which cut Capone from ear to mouth). The scars left from this attack led to Capone's nickname of \"Scarface,\" a name he personally hated. [PAR] Family Life [PAR] Not long after this attack, Al Capone met Mary (\"Mae\") Coughlin, who was pretty, blonde, middle-class, and came from a respectable Irish family. A few months after they started dating, Mae became pregnant. Al Capone and Mae got married on December 30, 1918, three weeks after their son (Albert Francis Capone, a.k.a. \"Sonny\") was born. Sonny was to remain Capone's only child. [PAR] Throughout the rest of his life, Al Capone kept his family and his business interests completely separate. Capone was a doting father and husband, taking great care in keeping his family safe, cared for, and out of the spotlight. [PAR] However, despite his love for his family, Capone did have a number of mistresses over the years. Plus, unknown to him at the time, Capone contracted syphilis from a prostitute before he met Mae. Since the symptoms of syphilis can disappear quickly, Capone had no idea that he still had the sexually transmitted disease or that it would so greatly affect his health in later years. [PAR] Capone Moves to Chicago [PAR] About 1920, Capone left the East Coast and headed to Chicago. He was looking for a fresh start working for Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio. Unlike Yale who used violence to run his racket, Torrio was a sophisticated gentleman who preferred cooperation and negotiation to rule his crime organization.

[PAR] Ascending to the throne at only 18\u00a0years old, Queen Victoria ruled the United Kingdom for nearly 64 years -- the longest of any British monarch. During her reign, Great Britain became a powerful industrial nation and boasted an empire that stretched across the globe. [PAR] Despite the early loss of her beloved husband, Queen Victoria provided a reassuring stability during much of the 19th century - an era of great social and technological change. The years of her reign are referred to as the Victorian Era.

Although Victoria was fifth in line to the throne - unlikely to become monarch - the duke feared that any future claim to the throne might be challenged if she were born abroad. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Profile of Queen Victoria [PAR] He ensured that his daughter was born on British soil, moving with his pregnant wife from Germany to England. [PAR] Christened Alexandrina Victoria at birth, the child came to be called Victoria. Despite being born into royalty, she did not grow up surrounded by wealth. Edward's spendthrift ways had left him with many debts. [PAR] The duke and duchess, in an attempt to reduce expenses, moved with their infant daughter to a modest home. Not long after the move, Edward became ill and died of pneumonia on January 23, 1820 (Victoria was just eight months old). Six days later, King George III died as well, thus making George IV King of England. [PAR] Victoria was now third in line to the throne behind her two uncles, who had failed to produce heirs. [PAR] Victoria's Less Than Royal Childhood [PAR] King George IV , whose only legitimate child had died in childbirth, was resentful of his brother's daughter. He begrudgingly allowed Victoria and her mother to move into an apartment at Kensington Palace, but would only approve a small allowance. The duchess\u2019s brother, Prince Leopold (later King Leopold I\u00a0of Belgium ), agreed to pay for Victoria's upbringing and education. [PAR] Tutors were hired to school Victoria in history, math, drawing, and languages. Raised by a German mother who spoke little English, Victoria spoke mostly German the first few years of her life, but readily learned both English and French. [PAR] In 1827, when Victoria was eight, her Uncle Frederick, the Duke of York, died, placing her one step closer to the throne. [PAR] A Scheming Pair [PAR] When newly widowed, Victoria's mother had turned for advice to John Conroy, a colleague of her late husband. In the years following the duke's death, the self-serving Conroy convinced the duchess that she should have herself declared Victoria's regent (an agent acting on behalf of an incapacitated or underage monarch) in the event that Victoria became queen while still a minor. In this way, Conroy - through the duchess - could essentially control the throne. [PAR] When King George IV (who loathed Conroy and the duchess) died in 1830, the pair believed they could easily persuade newly-crowned King William IV to name the duchess as Victoria's regent. But King William did not trust the duchess and refused her request. The duchess petitioned Parliament, winning approval as Victoria's sole regent in 1831. [PAR] The regency proved unnecessary.

Unable to afford to go to university, he worked in an insurance office until he was 27, when he joined Preston repertory company and made his professional stage debut in The Gay Dog. After Preston, he starred in productions at Wolverhampton, Salisbury and The Old Vic Company at Bristol's Theatre Royal. In 1962 he made his first big-screen appearance in A Kind of Loving, followed by other films throughout the 1960s, including Billy Liar, King Rat and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and TV appearances such as Z Cars, The Avengers and Steptoe and Son. His portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the 1969 play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui made him a West End star. His roles as Rigsby in Rising Damp and the title role in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin made him a household name, and his Cinzano commercials with Joan Collins were comic masterpieces.

[PAR] Bible Question: [PAR] It sounds as if Moses was the first born son according to Exodus 2:1-2, but then in Exodus 6:20 it lists Aaron and then Moses as brothers. Aaron is listed first so he would be the oldest. Where was Aaron when Moses was put in the basket by his mother? Did Moses and Aaron have the same parents? The Bible also mentions Miriam as Aaron's sister (Exodus 15:20) but why not Moses as well? Could you explain the family relationship of these three? [PAR] Bible Answer: [PAR] The three passages you refer to are presented below. [PAR] Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months. (NASB) Exodus 2:1-2 [PAR] And Amram married his father\u2019s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram\u2019s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. (NASB) Exodus 6:20 [PAR] And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron\u2019s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.Ex. 15:20 [PAR] First, we want to notice that the Bible does not provide any details about Aaron in the account of Moses in the basket (Exodus 2). Scripture never tries to give us all of the details because it is more interested in sending us a message. In both of the passages above, we are told that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam are the children of one father. His name was Amram. He was a Levite. [PAR] Other Proof? There are two other passages in the Old Testament that clearly tell us these three are brothers and a sister. The first passage is found in Numbers 26 and the second one is found in 1 Chronicles. [PAR] And the name of Amram\u2019s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. (NASB) Numbers 26:59 [PAR] And the children of Amram were Aaron, Moses, and Miriam . . . (NASB) 1 Chronicles 6:3 [PAR] The first passage says that their father was named Amram and their mother was Jochebed. From Exodus 2:1 we discovered that Amram was a Levite and from Numbers 26 we discover that Jochebed was a Levite too! Together Amram and Jochebed had two sons named Aaron and Moses and one daughter named Miriam. The second passage confirms the statement of the first one. [PAR] Moses and Aaron. From both of those passages, we discover that Aaron was the older brother, since he was listed first in each geneaology. It was customary in the Old Testament to list the first born son first. This is great news. God is more concerned about the heart of a person than about their lineage. I wonder how Moses felt when God told him that he was going to let his older brother speak for him, and how Aaron felt when Moses became the leader of Israel. [PAR] Conclusion: [PAR] The answer to that first question may be found in this verse, [PAR] Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth. (NASB) Numbers 12:3 [PAR] Moses was a very humble man. I believe that Moses did not react negatively to his brother\u2019s speaking for God before Moses. What a wonderful example to us. God calls us to serve Him and not worry about the other person. Praise the Lord.

It is said that the two most well-known political parties in American are the Democrats and Republicans. Surprising to some, the two parties are represented by the symbols of a donkey and an elephant (respectively). [PAR] Initially these animal symbols were used on campaign  banners, but over the years they have become two of the most outstanding logos  in American politics allowing candidates to introduce their US political  logo designs . Let\u2019s take a look at the brief history behind these two political logos. We\u2019ll also review how these two animal symbols came to represent the two of the biggest political parties of US. [PAR] The Democratic Donkey [PAR] The Democrats were first to use the donkey as their representative symbol. The donkey represents the Democrats\u2019 beginning 1828.\u00a0 The running President of 1828 was President Andrew Jackson and he was labeled as a \u201cjackass\u201d due to his populist views and stubborn nature. His main slogan was, \u201cLet the people rule.\u201d Although the cartoon was depicted to mock him, it was later adopted by Jackson himself to represent his Democratic party in 1837. [PAR] The Republican Elephant [PAR] Some believe that being a Republican influenced Thomas Nast on choosing a bull elephant to represent his party. However, the Republican elephant was not as intentional as Jackson\u2019s donkey. It was formed through a series of events involving New York\u2019s two popular magazines, The Herald and The Harper\u2019s Weekly. The Herald once ran a story of zoo animals being let loose and roaming in New York\u2019s Central Park looking for prey. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a cartoon of a donkey wearing lion\u2019s skin, chasing away all the animals (given below). This cartoon was a metaphor for President Ulysses S. Grant whom was running for third term presidency and there was a significant amount of conflict in the Democratic Party. This was one reason that the cartoon included a panicked elephant bearing the label, \u201cRepublican Vote.\u201d \u00a0Ever since then, the elephant became the Republican Party\u2019s its main symbol.However such attacks on political campaign branding are not isolated  incidents of the past. We witness Republican  logo design goof ups today as well. [PAR] Discussion and Meaning of these Symbols [PAR] The Democratic donkey represents hard work, diligence, humbleness and a dedication to the USA. The Republicans however, strongly disagree and consider the donkey a symbol of stubbornness. [PAR] On the other hand, the Republican elephant represents intelligence, dignity and is considered as the symbol of strength (as it is seen as the only animal that stood up to a lion). In contrast to this, the Democrats see the elephant as comparable to a circus animal. [PAR] Both of these symbols found firm foundation in the growing American pop culture and were copyrighted to represent the two political parties. The political logos have the prominent standardized colors and stars of the American flag. Generally, the Republican elephant logo upholds 3 stars while the Democratic donkey logo design has 4. However, the donkey can also been seen with a variation of 3 stars. [PAR] The Man Behind the Logo Designs [PAR] Thomas Nast was a political cartoonist, who usually drew satirical cartoons depicting the state of American politics. It was his idea to use the two animals for representing the Democratic and Republican parties. Thomas Nast was born in 1840 and had a great career being a caricaturist, an illustrator and a painter.

During the flight, the 27-year-old test pilot and industrial technician also became the first man to orbit the planet, a feat accomplished by his space capsule in 89 minutes. Vostok 1 orbited Earth at a maximum altitude of 187 miles and was guided entirely by an automatic control system. The only statement attributed to Gagarin during his one hour and 48 minutes in space was, \u201cFlight is proceeding normally; I am well.\u201d [PAR] After his historic feat was announced, the attractive and unassuming Gagarin became an instant worldwide celebrity. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and given the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Monuments were raised to him across the Soviet Union and streets renamed in his honor. [PAR] The triumph of the Soviet space program in putting the first man into space was a great blow to the United States, which had scheduled its first space flight for May 1961. Moreover, Gagarin had orbited Earth, a feat that eluded the U.S. space program until February 1962, when astronaut John Glenn made three orbits in Friendship 7. By that time, the Soviet Union had already made another leap ahead in the \u201cspace race\u201d with the August 1961 flight of cosmonaut Gherman Titov in Vostok 2. Titov made 17 orbits and spent more than 25 hours in space. [PAR] To Soviet propagandists, the Soviet conquest of space was evidence of the supremacy of communism over capitalism. However, to those who worked on the Vostok program and earlier on Sputnik (which launched the first satellite into space in 1957), the successes were attributable chiefly to the brilliance of one man: Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Because of his controversial past, Chief Designer Korolev was unknown in the West and to all but insiders in the USSR until his death in 1966. [PAR] Born in the Ukraine in 1906, Korolev was part of a scientific team that launched the first Soviet liquid-fueled rocket in 1933. In 1938, his military sponsor fell prey to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges, and Korolev and his colleagues were also put on trial. Convicted of treason and sabotage, Korolev was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. The Soviet authorities came to fear German rocket advances, however, and after only a year Korolev was put in charge of a prison design bureau and ordered to continue his rocketry work. [PAR] In 1945, Korolev was sent to Germany to learn about the V-2 rocket, which had been used to devastating effect by the Nazis against the British. The Americans had captured the rocket\u2019s designer, Wernher von Braun, who later became head of the U.S. space program, but the Soviets acquired a fair amount of V-2 resources, including rockets, launch facilities, blueprints, and a few German V-2 technicians. By employing this technology and his own considerable engineering talents, by 1954 Korolev had built a rocket that could carry a five-ton nuclear warhead and in 1957 launched the first intercontinental ballistic missile. [PAR] That year, Korolev\u2019s plan to launch a satellite into space was approved, and on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 was fired into Earth\u2019s orbit. It was the first Soviet victory of the space race, and Korolev, still technically a prisoner, was officially rehabilitated. The Soviet space program under Korolev would go on to numerous space firsts in the late 1950s and early \u201960s: first animal in orbit, first large scientific satellite, first man, first woman, first three men, first space walk, first spacecraft to impact the moon, first to orbit the moon, first to impact Venus, and first craft to soft-land on the moon.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] NATO phonetic alphabetThe International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet and also known as the ICAO radiotelephonic, phonetic or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet. Although often called \"phonetic alphabets\", spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel. [PAR] The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot,  Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu. [PAR] International adoption [PAR] After the phonetic alphabet was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  (see history below) it was adopted by many other international and national organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). [PAR] It is a subset of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which originally included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound signals by whistle, siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases.  The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...).  In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages. [PAR] NATO [PAR] A common name for this spelling alphabet, \"NATO phonetic alphabet,\" exists because it appears in Allied Tactical Publication ATP-1, Volume II: Allied Maritime Signal and Maneuvering Book used by all allied navies of NATO, which adopted a modified form of the International Code of Signals. Because the latter allows messages to be spelled via flags or Morse code, it naturally named the code words used to spell out messages by voice its \"phonetic alphabet\". The name NATO phonetic alphabet became widespread because the signals used to facilitate the naval communications and tactics of NATO have become global.  [PAR] However, ATP-1 is marked NATO Confidential (or the lower NATO Restricted) so it is not available publicly. Nevertheless, a NATO unclassified version of the document is provided to foreign, even hostile, militaries, even though they are not allowed to make it available publicly. The spelling alphabet is now also defined in other unclassified international military documents.  [PAR] The NATO alphabet appeared in some United States Air Force Europe publications during the Cold War. A particular example was the Ramstein Air Base, Telephone Directory published between 1969 and 1973 (currently out of print). The American and NATO versions had differences and the translation was provided as a convenience. Differences included Alfa, Bravo and Able, Baker for the first two letters.

[PAR] Pink Marble: A piece of pink marble about four inches (ten centimeters) across. The pink color is most likely derived from iron. Image by NASA. [PAR] What is Marble? [PAR] Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism.  It is composed primarily of the mineral calcite (CaCO3) and usually contains other minerals, such as clay minerals, micas, quartz , pyrite , iron oxides, and graphite . Under the conditions of metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone recrystallizes to form a rock that is a mass of interlocking calcite crystals. A related rock, dolomitic marble, is produced when dolostone is subjected to heat and pressure.

This specimen is a piece of white marble with a large red ruby crystal from Afghanistan. Specimen is about 1 1/4 inches across (about 3 centimeters). Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] How Does Marble Form? [PAR] Most marble forms at convergent plate boundaries where large areas of Earth's crust are exposed to regional metamorphism.  Some marble also forms by contact metamorphism when a hot magma body heats adjacent limestone or dolostone. [PAR] Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris.   During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes.  In the early stages of the  limestone-to-marble transformation, the calcite crystals in the rock are very small.  In a freshly-broken hand  specimen, they might only be recognized as a sugary sparkle of light reflecting from their tiny cleavage faces when the rock is played in the light. [PAR] As metamorphism progresses, the crystals grow larger and become easily recognizable as interlocking crystals of calcite.   Recrystallization obscures the original fossils and sedimentary structures of the limestone. It also occurs without forming  foliation, which normally is found in rocks that are altered by the directed pressure of a convergent plate boundary. [PAR] Recrystallization is what marks the separation between limestone and marble.  Marble that has been exposed to low levels of metamorphism will have very small calcite crystals.  The crystals become larger as the level of metamorphism progresses. Clay minerals within the marble will alter to micas and more complex silicate structures as the level of metamorphism increases. [PAR] Marble Dimension Stone: Marble cut into blocks and slabs of specific size is known as \"dimension stone.\"  Photo \u00a9 iStockphoto / Thomas Lehmann. [PAR] Physical Properties and Uses of Marble [PAR] Marble occurs in large deposits that can be hundreds of feet thick and geographically extensive.  This allows it to be  economically mined on a large scale, with some mines and quarries producing millions of tons per year. [PAR] Most marble is made into either crushed stone or dimension stone. Crushed stone is used as an aggregate in highways, railroad beds, building foundations, and other types of construction. Dimension stone is produced by sawing marble into  pieces of specific dimensions.   These are used in monuments, buildings, sculptures, paving and other projects.

[PAR] Bureau of Reclamation [PAR] Grand  Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River west of Spokane, Washington, is one of the  largest structures ever built by mankind--a mass of concrete standing 550 feet  high and 5,223 feet long, or just shy of a mile. Grand Coulee contains 12 million cubic yards  of concrete, or enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami. More massive than the Great Pyramid of Giza, Grand  Coulee is listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven  civil engineering wonders of the United States. Grand Coulee's reservoir,  Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, stretches 150  miles north, almost to the Canadian border. [PAR] A concrete gravity dam, Grand Coulee took  eight years to build, employed thousands of men during the Great Depression and,  when completed in 1942, provided the enormous electrical power necessary to  make aluminum, so essential for World War II production of planes and ships. It was  Grand Coulee, as well, that powered the production of plutonium at the nearby  Hanford Site, which figured prominently in the making of the atomic bomb. [PAR] So  grand was Grand Coulee Dam that in 1941 folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote \u201cThe  Song of the Grand Coulee Dam\u201d (though he was paid to do so under contract with  the Bonneville Power Administration.) \u201cBiggest  thing built by the hand of a Man,\u201d Guthrie sang. \u201cPower that sings, boys, turbines that whine.  Waters back up the Canadian Line.\u201d [PAR] Appropriate  as the word grand is for the dam, the  name Grand Coulee actually refers to a  unique geological feature created thousands of years ago when Ice Age glaciers  blocked the ancient riverbed of the Columbia River. When water eventually traveled under the ice  dam, great floods scoured out hundreds of miles of deep gulches, or coulees, in  the Columbia River Basin. One of these, the Grand  Coulee, is four miles wide and bordered on three sides by steep cliffs. [PAR] A local  proposal to dam the Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee dated to 1918, but  the idea faced strong competition from another proposal that called for an  irrigation canal to be built from the Pend Oreille River in northern Idaho. Proponents of this latter \u201cgravity plan\u201d argued that the hydroelectricity generated from the dam was not needed. Many studies followed, including one by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which took Grand Coulee\u2019s side, recommending a high dam  at the site and the pumping of irrigation water up to the surrounding  countryside. [PAR] This recommendation took hold with the Bureau  of Reclamation, which was promoting construction of multiple-use dams, through  which the production of hydroelectric power could produce revenue to help repay the construction cost of a project. (The Reclamation Act requires that beneficiaries of a project repay those costs, and a multi-purpose project reduced the payment burden on irrigators.) The recommendation found  traction with the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in a  time of great dust bowls and economic depression. Roosevelt launched federal program after  federal program in an attempt to spur the economy by \u201cpriming the pump\u201d and  providing jobs for out-of-work Americans.  Unprecedented funds flowed to the Bureau of Reclamation as it became a  key player in the New Deal\u2019s Public Works Administration (PWA), which spent \u201cbig bucks on big projects,\u201d Grand Coulee Dam among them.

The escape from the court changes the characters and creates a space of sexual freedom and chaos, where women take control and men learn lessons in romance. In the comedies, the forest becomes a distorted version of the court where social rules are broken, creating a sense of jovial confusion before a return to civilisation in the final act. [PAR] \u2018Gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time [PAR] carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\u2019 Act 1.1 [PAR] The forest can be defined as a 'pastoral space\u2019 that represents the opposite of urban life in the play, representing the division between the city and the country that was beginning to emerge in Shakespeare\u2019s time. The country was often seen as a place of nostalgia for a simpler time, as shown in Duke Senior\u2019s forest court that echoes tales of Robin Hood. The merry court of the forest is an inversion of the court at the beginning of the play, far from the threats of violence and cruel treatment of Duke Frederick. Danger in the forest of As You Like It is never truly life-threatening but, when considering the role of the forest in other plays such as Titus Andronicus, the possibility of violence draws a long shadow over the plot. [PAR] 'Alas, what danger will it be to us, [PAR] Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\u2019 Act 1.3 [PAR] When Rosalind and Celia decide to enter the forest, they must put on disguises as 'beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\u2019 (1.3) The threat of displaying beauty is underscored by the reputation forests had during Shakespeare\u2019s time as spaces where vagrants lived outside society, presenting a danger of sexual violence for women who wandered there alone. For wealthy women, such as Rosalind and Celia, the threat would be even more pronounced as they would be visibly affluent in a place of extreme poverty, fuelling Celia\u2019s decision to dress in 'poor and mean attire\u2019. (1.3) The forest of Arden is a place of comedy but underlying the play is a sense of unspoken danger, drawing on the role of the forest as a place of tragedy and violence that it assumes in Shakespeare\u2019s other plays.

By leaving the court she leaves behind the pressures of being a noblewoman and is able to express her desire for Orlando, albeit while dressed as a man. That Rosalind must cross-dress in order to express her desires is evidence that the forest can only allow so much freedom: the woman may take control, but only while others believe she is male. Rosalind engages with Orlando in a way that can be seen as homoerotic, creating both the sexual and gender confusion that permeates the forest. Her disguise frees her from womanhood but entraps her in masculinity, meaning she cannot marry Orlando unless she returns to presenting as female. Gender never truly breaks down in the forest, showing how the pastoral space is still linked to societal values that render women subordinate, values that Rosalind plays into when declaring women 'apish, shallow, inconstant.\u2019 (3.2) [PAR] 'The duke hath put on a religious life", "topic": "The contrast between the court and the Forest of Arden in terms of societal norms and character behavior.", "question": "How does the Forest of Arden serve as a liminal space that both subverts and reinforces the societal norms of the court in \"As You Like It,\" particularly in relation to gender roles and character behavior?", "answer": "The Forest of Arden subverts court norms by allowing cross-dressing and gender role inversion, yet reinforces them by limiting the freedom of female characters.", "explanation": "The Forest of Arden is portrayed as a space where characters can escape the strictures of court life, adopting new identities and challenging societal norms.

Although it took the ship over two and a half hours to sink, the vast majority of the crew and passengers perished due to a significant lack of lifeboats and improper use of those that did exist. The lifeboats could have held over 1,100 people, but only 705 people were saved; nearly 1,500 perished the night the Titanic sank.

Ballard had grown up in San Diego, California, near the ocean, where he began his life-long fascination with the ocean and learned to scuba dive. After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965 with degrees in both chemistry and geology, Ballard signed up for the Army. Two years later, in 1967, Ballard transferred to the Navy, where he was assigned to the Deep Submergence Group at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Research Institution in Massachusetts, thus beginning his illustrious career with submersibles. [PAR] By 1974, Ballard had received two doctoral degrees (marine geology and geophysics) from the University of Rhode Island and had spent a lot of time conducting deep water dives in a manned submersible he helped design, called Alvin.

An additional 22\u00a0countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15\u00a0other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70 percent of the global total.  Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2 percent of GDP. [PAR] NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion\u2014doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the organization was drawn into the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004. [PAR] Article\u00a05 of the North Atlantic treaty, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks,  after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations  and in 2011 enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. The less potent Article 4, which merely invokes consultation among NATO members, has been invoked five times: by Turkey in 2003 over the Iraq War; twice in 2012 by Turkey over the Syrian Civil War, after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F-4 reconnaissance jet, and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria;  in 2014 by Poland, following the Russian intervention in Crimea;  and again by Turkey in 2015 after threats by the Islamic State to its territorial integrity.  [PAR] History  [PAR] Beginnings  [PAR] The Treaty of Brussels, signed on 17\u00a0March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. The treaty and the Soviet Berlin Blockade led to the creation of the Western European Union's Defence Organization in September 1948. However, participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the military power of the USSR and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism, so talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately resulting in the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4\u00a0April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was \"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.\" Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949. The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called Atlanticism which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010.

For the time being, they have the fairly clunky Latin and Greek numerical names ununtium (Uut), ununpentium (Uup), ununseptium (Uus), and ununoctium (Uuo), but, by IUPAC rules, their discovers now get the chance to officially name them.

Whether these two petitions will come to fruition remains to be seen\u2014the final names are not likely to be announced until later in the spring\u2014but as IUPAC rules demand all new elements be named after either a mythological concept or character, a mineral, a place, a property of the element itself, or a scientist [ PDF ], it seems unlikely we\u2019ll be seeing lemmium on the walls of chemistry classes any time soon. The stories behind 20 other chemical element names are explained here.\u00a0 [PAR] 1. LITHIUM (3) [PAR] Despite being the least dense metal, lithium takes its name from the Greek word for \u201cstone,\u201d lithos, because it was discovered in a rock (as opposed to the other alkali metals potassium and sodium, which were discovered in plants and animals).\u00a0 [PAR] 2. CARBON (6) [PAR] The name carbon comes from the Latin word carbo, meaning \u201ccoal\u201d or \u201ccharcoal.\u201d A small carbo, incidentally, was a carbunculus, which is the origin of carbuncle.\u00a0 [PAR] 3. NEON (10) [PAR] Neon takes its name from neos, the Greek word for \u201cnew\u201d (it was \u201cnewly\u201d discovered in 1898). [PAR] 4. PHOSPHORUS (15) [PAR] Phosphorus literally means \u201clight-bearer\u201d or \u201clight-bringing,\u201d as the first compound of the element glowed in the dark. A century before it became the name of element 15 in the late 1600s, Phosphorus was an alternative name for the planet Venus, whose appearance in the sky was once believed to strengthen the light and heat of the Sun.

VANADIUM (23) [PAR] One of the transition metals, pure vanadium is a harsh steel-grey color, but four of its oxidation states produce a rainbow of solutions, colored purple, green, blue, and yellow . Because he was so impressed with how beautiful and varied these solutions were, the Swedish chemist Nils Sefstr\u00f6m chose to name vanadium after Vanad\u00eds, an alternate name for the Norse goddess of beauty, Freya.

If the skin of a typical 150-pound (68-kilogram) adult male were stretched out flat, it would cover about 2 square yards (1.7 square meters) and weigh about 9 pounds (4 kilograms). Our skin protects the network of muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and everything else inside our bodies. Our eyelids have the thinnest skin, the soles of our feet the thickest. [PAR] Hair is actually a modified type of skin. Hair grows everywhere on the human body except the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips. Hair grows more quickly in summer than winter, and more slowly at night than during the day. [PAR] Like hair, nails are a type of modified skin. Nails protect the sensitive tips of fingers and toes. Human nails aren't necessary for living, but they do provide support for the tips of the fingers and toes, protect them from injury, and aid in picking up small objects. Without them, we'd have a hard time scratching an itch or untying a knot. Nails can be an indicator of a person's general health, and illness often affects their growth. [PAR] continue [PAR] Skin Basics [PAR] Skin is essential in many ways. It forms a barrier that prevents harmful substances and microorganisms from entering the body. It protects body tissues against injury. It also controls the loss of life-sustaining fluids like blood and water, helps regulate body temperature through perspiration (sweating), and protects from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays. [PAR] Without the nerve cells in skin, people couldn't feel warmth, cold, or other sensations. For instance, goosebumps form when the erector pili muscles contract to make hairs on the skin stand up straight when someone is cold, excited,\u00a0or frightened \u2014 the blood vessels keep the body from losing heat by narrowing as much as possible and keeping the warm blood away from the skin's surface, offering insulation and protection. [PAR] Every square inch of skin contains thousands of cells and hundreds of sweat glands, oil glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels. Skin is made up of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous tissue. [PAR] The upper layer of our skin, the epidermis, is the tough, protective outer layer. It's about as thick as a sheet of paper over most parts of the body. The epidermis has four layers of cells that are constantly flaking off and being renewed. In these four layers are three special types of cells: [PAR] Melanocytes produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. All people have roughly the same number of melanocytes; the more melanin that is produced, the darker the skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the production of melanin, which is why people get suntanned or freckled. [PAR] Keratinocytes produce keratin, a type of protein that is a basic component of hair, skin, nails, and helps create an intact barrier. [PAR] Langerhans cells help protect the body against infection. [PAR] Because the cells in the epidermis are completely replaced about every 28 days, cuts and scrapes heal quickly. [PAR] Below the epidermis is the next layer of our skin, the dermis, which is made up of blood vessels, nerve endings, and connective tissue. The dermis nourishes the epidermis. Two types of fibers in the dermis \u2014 collagen and elastin \u2014 help the skin stretch when we bend and reposition itself when we straighten up. Collagen is strong and hard to stretch, and elastin, as its name suggests, is elastic. In older people, some of the elastin-containing fibers degenerate, which is one reason why the skin looks wrinkled. [PAR] The dermis also contains a person's sebaceous glands. These glands, which surround and empty into hair follicles and pores, produce the oil sebum that lubricates the skin and hair. Sebaceous glands are found mostly in the skin on the face, upper back, shoulders, and chest.

(2003).\u00a0 (Photo by Michel Boutefeu/Getty Images) [PAR] By Jennifer L. Goss, Contributing Writer [PAR] Updated February 03, 2016. [PAR] After the sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, the great ship slumbered on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean for over 70 years before its wreckage was discovered. On September 1, 1985, a joint American-French expedition, headed by famous American oceanographer Dr. Robert Ballard, found the Titanic over two miles below the ocean\u2019s surface by using an unmanned submersible called Argo. This discovery gave new meaning to the Titanic\u2019s sinking and gave birth to new dreams in ocean exploration. [PAR] The Titanic\u2019s Journey [PAR] Built in Ireland from 1909 to 1912 on behalf of the British-owned White Star Line, the Titanic officially left its final European port of Queenstown, Ireland on April 11, 1912. Carrying over 2,200 passengers and crew, the Titanic began its maiden voyage across the Atlantic, headed for New York. [PAR] The Titanic carried passengers from all walks of life. Tickets were sold to first, second, and third class passengers; the latter group largely consisting of immigrants seeking a better life. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Famous first class passengers included the Astors, the Strausses, J. Bruce Ismay, and Benjamin Guggenheim. [PAR] The Sinking of the Titanic [PAR] Only three days after setting sail, the Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on April 14, 1912, somewhere in the North Atlantic. Although it took the ship over two and a half hours to sink, the vast majority of the crew and passengers perished due to a significant lack of lifeboats and improper use of those that did exist. The lifeboats could have held over 1,100 people, but only 705 people were saved; nearly 1,500 perished the night the Titanic sank. [PAR] People around the world were shocked when they heard that the \u201cunsinkable\u201d Titanic had sunk. They wanted to know the details of the disaster. Yet, however much the survivors could share, theories about how and why the Titanic sank would remain unsubstantiated until the wreckage of the great ship could be found. There was just one problem -- no one was sure exactly where the Titanic had sunk. [PAR] Robert Ballard [PAR] Robert Ballard wanted to find the wreckage of the Titanic. Ballard had grown up in San Diego, California, near the ocean, where he began his life-long fascination with the ocean and learned to scuba dive. After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965 with degrees in both chemistry and geology, Ballard signed up for the Army. Two years later, in 1967, Ballard transferred to the Navy, where he was assigned to the Deep Submergence Group at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Research Institution in Massachusetts, thus beginning his illustrious career with submersibles. [PAR] By 1974, Ballard had received two doctoral degrees (marine geology and geophysics) from the University of Rhode Island and had spent a lot of time conducting deep water dives in a manned submersible he helped design, called Alvin. During subsequent dives in 1977 and 1979 near the Galapagos Rift, Ballard helped discover hydrothermal vents . More importantly, though, were the amazing plants that grew around these vents; it was the scientific study of these plants that led to the discovery of chemosynthesis , a process in which plants use chemical reactions rather than sunlight to get energy. [PAR] Yet, however many shipwrecks Ballard explored and however much of the ocean floor he mapped, Ballard never forgot about the Titanic. Ballard has said, \u201cI always wanted to find the Titanic.

{"context": "[DOC] [TLE] Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)The Speaker of the House of Commons is the presiding officer of the House of Commons, the United Kingdom's lower chamber of Parliament. The office is currently held by John Bercow, who was initially elected on 22 June 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin. He was returned as an MP in the 2010 general election and was re-elected as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2010. He was again returned as an MP in the 2015 general election and was re-elected, unopposed, as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2015.  [PAR] The Speaker presides over the House's debates, determining which members may speak. The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries, the Speaker remains strictly non-partisan, and renounces all affiliation with his or her former political party when taking office as well as when leaving the office. The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to Speaker Denison's rule). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions, and remains a constituency Member of Parliament (MP). The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker's House at the Palace of Westminster.  [PAR] History [PAR] The office of Speaker is almost as old as Parliament itself. The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258, when Peter de Montfort presided over the Parliament held in Oxford. Early presiding officers were known by the title parlour or prolocutor. The continuous history of the office of Speaker is held to date from 1376  when Sir Peter de la Mare spoke for the commons in the \"Good Parliament\" as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of the Crown and the most unpopular members of the king's household. Edward III was frail and in seclusion, his prestigious eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, terminally ill. It was left to the next son, a furious John of Gaunt, to fight back. He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics. In the next, \"Bad Parliament\", in 1377, a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt's steward, Thomas Hungerford, as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors' misdoings of the previous year. Gaunt evidently wanted a 'mirror-image' as his form of counter-coup and this notion, born in crisis, of one 'speaker', who quickly also became 'chairman' and organiser of the Commons' business, was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376-7. [PAR] On 6 October 1399, Sir John Cheyne of Beckford (Gloucester) was elected speaker. The powerful Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne's reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years. [PAR] Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament, with at least one contested election known, in 1420 (Roger Hunt prevailing by a majority of just four votes), in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted, indicating that the famous 'defence of the Commons' privilege' should not be seen in isolation as the principal thread in the office's evolution. Whilst the idea of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons' role, the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house's business and responses to the Crown's agenda, much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted.
