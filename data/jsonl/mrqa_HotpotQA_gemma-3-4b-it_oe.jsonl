{"context": "[PAR] [TLE] Wendell Tucker [SEP] Wendell Edward Tucker (born September 4, 1943) is a former professional American football player who played wide receiver for four seasons for the Los Angeles Rams.  Tucker spent most of his first season on the \"taxi-squad\" while learning behind the Rams' starting flanker Bernie Casey.  Tucker saw action in 10 of the team's 14 games in 1968 (catching only 7 passes but 4 of them went for touchdowns), and then became the starting flanker after Casey's retirement.  The 1969 season would prove to be his most productive as, playing opposite wide receiver Jack Snow, he caught 38 passes for 629 yards and 7 touchdowns, including a 93 yarder vs. the 49ers for the Coastal Division champion Rams.  Tucker returned in 1970 but was hampered by injuries and caught only 12 passes in 12 games.  In May 1971, Tucker was traded along with Billy Truax to the Dallas Cowboys for receiver Lance Rentzel.

{"context": "[PAR] [TLE] Music for Electric Metronomes [SEP] Music for Electric Metronomes is an avant-garde aleatoric composition written in 1960 by Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi for any number of performers between three and eight.  The piece involves the manipulation of electric metronomes, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions.  It is a very theatrical piece, and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with Fluxus, an experimental art movement from the sixties.  The only true scored \"instrument\" is an electric metronome for each individual player, though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer.  Because the graphic notation of score (which is a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths) leaves a lot of room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced.  There is no conductor for the performance.  It has been recorded on the album \"Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's & 1990's\".  In a review of a performance by the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1992 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the music critic of \"The New York Times\", Alex Ross, described the piece as \"merely a timid, spastic prelude to Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's monumental \"Po\u00e8me symphonique\" for 100 metronomes\".
