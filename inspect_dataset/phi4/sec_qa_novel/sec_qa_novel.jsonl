Digital Certificates {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__digital_certificates}\nA digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company or an individual. Since asymmetric encryption\n\nrequires know a party's public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of the owner. The question\n\nthen becomes how do you trust that the public key is *actually* for the alleged owner? That's where the issuing\n\nauthority comes in. A *certificate authority (CA)* signs the certificate indicating that the ID and public_key are\n\ncorrect. Certificates can be self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often only used in\n\ntesting. Since most certificates are used for encrypting web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is\n\nusing a self-signed certificate.\n\nGiven how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not\n\nissues by root CAs, but are actually issued by intermediate CAs. Root CAs delegate the work to Intermediate CAs and\n\nindicate their trust in them by signing the intermediate CAs keys. This creates a *chain of trust* from the issued\n\ncertificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA (signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by\n\nthe browser). Tools that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and update them from the companies\n\nthat issue them as needed.\n\nThe certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact with it is often possible to install root CAs\n\nmanually. [This is can be used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for\n\ndebugging](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert){.link} or for more nefarious\n\npurposes.

A bonus of 25 points is awarded for every post that is a prime number. However, if a post's position in the sequence is divisible by 7, a 17-point penalty is applied. After a sequence of 100 posts, calculate the total points a member has earned. How many net points does the member have if we consider the bonuses and penalties?\n\n# bob\nTo determine the total points a member earns after 100 posts, we need to consider the points earned for each post, the bonus points for prime-numbered posts, and the penalty points for posts whose positions are divisible by 7.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the base points for each post\nThe points for each post follow an arithmetic sequence where the first post earns 1 point, the second post earns 2 points, and so on. The \\( n \\)-th post earns \\( n \\) points.\n\nThe total base points for the first 100 posts can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\nFor \\( n = 100 \\):\n\\[\nS_{100} = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} = 5050\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the bonus points for prime-numbered posts\nWe need to identify the prime numbers between 1 and 100 and sum the bonuses for these posts. The prime numbers in this range are:\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nThere are 25 prime numbers in this range. Each prime-numbered post earns an additional 25 points. Therefore, the total bonus points are:\n\\[\n25 \\times 25 = 625\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the penalty points for posts divisible by 7\nWe need to identify the posts whose positions are divisible by 7 within the first 100 posts. These positions are:\n7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98\n\nThere are 14 such posts. Each of these posts incurs a 17-point penalty. Therefore, the total penalty points are:\n\\[\n14 \\times 17 = 238\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the net points\nThe net points are calculated by adding the base points and the bonus points, then subtracting the penalty points:\n\\[\n\\text{Net points} = 5050 + 625 - 238\n\\]\n\nPerform the arithmetic:\n\\[\n5050 + 625 = 5675\n\\]\n\\[\n5675 - 238 = 5437\n\\]\n\nThus, the total net points the member has earned after 100 posts, considering the bonuses and penalties, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5437}\n\\]<!-- Customer -->\nThe following is a primary school math problem: Xiao Ming has 8 pieces of chocolate, and he wants to share them with his 4 friends. How many pieces of chocolate can each friend get?\n\n<!-- Support -->\nTo solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of chocolates Xiao Ming has by the number of friends he wants to share them with.\n\nHere are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. Start with the total number of chocolates Xiao Ming has, which is 8.\n2. Count the number of friends Xiao Ming wants to share his chocolates with, which is 4.\n3. To find out how many pieces of chocolate each friend can get, we divide the total number of chocolates by the number of friends.\n4. Perform the division: 8 chocolates \u00f7 4 friends = 2 chocolates per friend.\n\nSo, each of Xiao Ming's friends can get 2 pieces of chocolate.### exercise\nWhat are the implications of using the term \"power sharing\" instead of \"democracy\" when discussing the concept of consociationalism, and how does this choice of terminology affect the perception of the model?\n\n### answer\nThe term \"power sharing\" as used in the context of consociationalism carries a more neutral connotation compared to \"democracy.\" It suggests a focus on the distribution and management of power among different groups within a society, rather than emphasizing the broader democratic principles of majority rule and individual rights.

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at.

Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

Least Privilege {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__least_privilege}\nThe principle of least privilege states that an actor should only be given access to resources as necessary and with the\n\npermissions necessary to complete their task. These resources may be processes, programs, or even user accounts. This\n\nprinciple reduces an attack surface and helps stop the spread of malware as a single compromised account will not have\n\naccess to all of the resources.\n\nLeast privilege is also an important concept for compliance purposes. For example, laws may require and audit of all\n\naccounts that have Internet access. By limiting accounts that have Internet access to only the accounts of actors that\n\nrequire Internet access to complete their tasks, it makes it easier to be in compliance.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.1.2.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__multi_factor_authentication_mfa}\nMulti-factor authentication is a technique that requires actors to provide two or more pieces of information to be used\n\nas identification. Some examples of identification would be usernames and passwords, token codes, a physical token, or\n\nbiometric data. Typically it is suggested to use \\\"something you have and something you know\\\" for example the code in\n\nan SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password (you know your password).\n\nThere are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the time based creation of a code.

    "response": "```markdown\n<document_analysis>\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination:** The context revolves around using `nmap` for network scanning, exploring core concepts of cybersecurity, and understanding the implications of data gathered from scans. Key themes include network security, the potential vulnerabilities of open ports, and the importance of precise network mapping.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration:** \n   - The central idea is the use of `nmap` to perform detailed network scans. The nuances include understanding the role of open ports, implications of network security breaches, and the strategic importance of port scanning in identifying vulnerabilities.\n   - Implicit in this context is the assumption that the expert should know how to interpret the results of network scans and understand the potential impact on network security.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration:** \n   - The difficulty is rated at 9/10 due to the need for deep technical knowledge about network security, implications of different network scanning techniques, and the ability to interpret scan results in a meaningful way.\n   \n4. **Intentional Question Planning:** \n   - The question must challenge the expert's understanding of network protocols, implications of specific scans, and their potential misuse or misinterpretation.\n   \n### Thought Process\n1. **Central Ideas and Nuances:**\n   - Core themes: Network scanning, security implications, and interpretation of scan results.\n   - Subtle details: The ability to predict network behavior and potential vulnerabilities based on scan results.\n   \n2. **Conceptual Understanding and Implications:**\n   - The question should involve deep technical knowledge about the implications of specific network scans and potential misconfigurations.\n   \n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration:**\n   - The question must require a synthesis of knowledge on network security, implications of findings, and potential network vulnerabilities.\n\n## Output\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of network security, how would you leverage the information obtained from an nmap scan to enhance the security of a network while ensuring minimal disruption to services?\n\nA: By implementing a firewall rule to block all traffic to specific ports identified as vulnerable, thereby preventing unauthorized access.\nB: By configuring a network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor and log suspicious activities, enhancing security without disrupting service.\nC: By using a VPN to obscure network activity, ensuring data privacy and minimizing exposure to external threats.\nD: By disabling unnecessary services and ports to reduce the attack surface, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. By configuring a network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to actively monitor and log suspicious activities, we can enhance the security of a network while minimizing service disruptions. This approach is proactive, allowing for real-time detection and response to potential security breaches without disrupting normal operations.\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>\n\n### Explanation:\n- **A** is incorrect because simply blocking all traffic to a specific port can result in service disruption and may not address the root cause of a vulnerability.\n- **B** is correct because the correct implementation of IDS ensures network security without disrupting services. The IDS actively monitors traffic and logs suspicious activities, enabling real-time response to potential security breaches without disrupting normal operations.\n- **C** is incorrect because using a VPN to obscure network activity does not directly enhance security by protecting data in transit. While VPNs ensure data privacy, they do not replace the need for active monitoring of network traffic for security threats.\n- **D** is incorrect because disabling unnecessary services and ports to reduce the attack surface is a good security practice, but it does not directly relate to the specific network security measures like those provided by IDS, which can log and respond to threats in real-time without disrupting services.\n\n### Rationale:\n- **Conceptual Understanding:** This question demands an in-depth understanding of network security concepts, the functionality of IDS, and the implications of gathered scan data.\n- **Complexity:** The complexity is high (9/10), requiring the expert to apply theoretical knowledge to practical network security, understanding the implications of each scan result, and the strategic placement of IDS for network security.\n- **Implications:** The correct answer is B, as implementing IDS allows for proactive monitoring and immediate response to potential security breaches without disrupting services, which is essential for maintaining network security.\n- **In-Depth Analysis:** The question challenges the expert to think beyond basic port scanning. It requires an understanding of how to interpret the results of network scans and their implications for network security.\n- **Educational Impact:** This question requires an understanding of the importance of maintaining network security while ensuring minimal disruption to services. It encourages the expert to think about the broader implications of the scan results, the potential vulnerabilities exposed, and the appropriate responses to mitigate risks.",

It involves understanding how the permissions (user, group, others), the special permissions, and mask interact to affect system security and usability. It requires understanding how these permissions work together to form a comprehensive security model.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\nGiven the context, the question should challenge the understanding of how specific permission settings can influence system security and functionality, requiring a nuanced understanding of the interplay between these elements.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\nThe question should encourage a deep engagement with the content, focusing on the subtleties of how the mask and special permissions work together in a real-world scenario, reflecting the need for domain expertise in system security.\n\n### Question Generation\n\n**Question:**\nThe question will focus on the implications of the mask on file permissions in a Linux environment and how it interacts with the other elements mentioned in the context.\n\n<document_analysis>\nThe given context discusses the concept of file permissions in a Linux system. Key aspects to analyze include:\n1. How the mask influences the effective permissions.\n2. The role of the mask in determining access and security implications.\n3. The significance of the file system permissions and their impact on security, focusing on the nuanced application of these permissions in real-world scenarios.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<question_topic>\nThe question should be related to file permissions in a Linux environment, specifically focusing on how the mask value impacts the effective permissions of a file or directory.\n</question_topic>\n\n<context>\n# file permissions\n\n## Overview\nIn this section, we cover the basics of file permissions in Linux, including special permissions, which are often used in security contexts. Understanding how these permissions interact is crucial for system administrators and developers.\n\n## User, Group, and Others\nFile permissions are critical to securing a system. Each permission has a specific role, and they must be correctly set to `rwx` for users, groups, and others. The mask determines what permissions are enforceable by the system, ensuring that users cannot access files with the incorrect permissions. It is essential to understand the file structure's and their application in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a file with the following attributes:\n\n- User: alice\n- Group: developers\n- File: permissions.txt\n\nFile permissions are represented in a file system with the following permissions:\n\n- user (owner): rwx\n- group: ---\n- user: r-x\n\nIn this case, the owner and group permissions interact to define the user's and group's ability to modify the file.\n\nThe permissions are represented in a format that showcases the allowed operations. For example, the file permissions can be represented as a combination of several attributes that determine the actions allowed or denied to users.\n\n### Permissions Syntax\n\nThe permissions are structured in the format:\n- User (user): user permissions are defined in a mask that controls their access rights.\n- Group (group): permissions determine the group's ability to read and write files or directories.\n- Global (others): these permissions define what actions are allowed for the general public or external users.\n\n### Example\nHere is a representation of the permissions in a Linux system:\n\n```\n# group: system user\nuser: root\nrole: user\n\n# file permissions\nuser::rwx\ngroup::---rwx\nmask::rwx\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\n<document_analysis>\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nThe context discusses the concept of file permissions in Linux, focusing on the Mask, which is a filter for what a user can do to a file or directory. The analysis should consider the interaction of different file permissions, how these permissions relate to the Mask, and what additional factors such as group permissions and file system attributes are crucial for understanding.\n\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n\n1. **Central Ideas and Nuanced Themes:**\n   - The central theme is understanding file permissions in a Linux environment, specifically how the mask affects file permissions.\n   - The mask serves as a filter for permissions, limiting what permissions are enforceable by the system.\n   - Permissions are represented in a structured format, indicating user, group, and others' rights.\n   - Special permissions like setuid, setgid, and sticky bits can modify the basic permissions, affecting how files and directories are accessed.\n\n2. **Implicit Assumptions and Subtle Details:**\n   - The text assumes a basic understanding of Linux file permissions, including read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions.\n   - The mask's role is crucial in determining effective permissions, acting as a filter that limits enforceable permissions.\n   - Special permissions and the mask interact to form a comprehensive security model, impacting system security and functionality.\n\n3. **Underlying Theories and Potential Applications:**\n   - The mask is a fundamental concept in Linux security, ensuring that permissions are enforced correctly.\n   - Understanding the mask's impact on file permissions is essential for system administrators to secure a system effectively.\n   - The interaction between permissions and the mask can be applied to real-world scenarios to enhance system security and manage access control.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nGiven the context, the question should challenge the understanding of how specific permission settings can influence system security and functionality, requiring a nuanced understanding of the interplay between these elements.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nThe question should encourage a deep engagement with the content, focusing on the nuances of how the mask and special permissions work together in a real-world scenario, reflecting the need for domain expertise in system security.\n\n### Irrelevant or Bogus Information\n\nNo irrelevant or bogus information was identified in the context. The content is coherent and educationally valuable, providing a solid basis for generating a challenging question.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does the `mask` in a Linux file permission setting affect the effective permissions for a file, and what potential security implications could arise from its incorrect configuration?\n\nA: It sets the maximum permissions that can be granted, potentially allowing unauthorized access if misconfigured.\nB: It overrides user and group permissions, ensuring that only the owner can access the file.\nC: It specifies the default permissions for new files, impacting how they are accessed by different users.\nD: It determines the special permissions like setuid and setgid, affecting the execution rights of files.\n\nExplanation: The mask is a filter that limits the permissions enforceable by the system, acting as a ceiling for user and group permissions. Incorrect configuration of the mask can lead to unauthorized access if it allows higher permissions than intended.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>\n```",

Business Continuity {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__business_continuity}\nThe concept of continuity is central to the steps taken to respond to an incident. Remember that the goal is to keep\n\nthings running and keep services available. Business Continuity has three main parts: Business Continuity Planning\n\n(BCP), Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP).\n\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) is a methodology for keeping things running. With BCP threats are identified in\n\nadvance and critical business processes are prioritized. Recovery procedures for these processes have been developed and\n\ntested. In response to an incident, these procedures are followed as practiced.\n\nBusiness Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies business functions and rates the impact of an outage on these functions. BIA\n\nmeasures the impact of an outage on:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Property (tangible assets)]{.principal}\n\n- [Finance (monetary funding)]{.principal}\n\n- [Safety (physical protection)]{.principal}\n\n- [Reputation (status)]{.principal}\n\n- [Life (well being)]{.principal}\n\n- [Customers]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nBIA can help pinpoint mission-essential functions and single points of failure. This allows SOCs to determine where\n\nthere resources should go in terms of having the best chance of maintaining business continuity.\n\nFinally having a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) makes it easier to recover in the case of a large-scale issue. Disaster\n\nRecovery (DR) entails policies, tools, and procedures to recover from an outage.

Your task is to determine the habitat of each creature using the following clues:\n\n1. The habitats are: Enchanted Forest, Crystal Cave, Mystic Lake, Whispering Meadow, Shadowy Swamp, and Blazing Volcano.\n2. The creatures are: Phoenix, Griffin, Basilisk, Unicorn, Dragon, and Pegasus.\n3. Each habitat has a unique environmental trait: magical, luminous, serene, mystical, gloomy, and fiery.\n4. The habitats are: Forest of Whispers, Glimmering Cavern, Shimmering Lagoon, Tranquil Glade, Murky Bog, and Scorching Mountain.\n5. The habitats have the following environmental traits: magical, luminous, serene, mystical, gloomy, and fiery.\n\nClues:\n- The Phoenix is reborn from flames and resides in a habitat with a fiery trait.\n- The Griffin, known for its keen eyesight, prefers the luminous environment of the Glimmering Cavern.\n- The Basilisk, with its stone-like skin and petrifying gaze, resides in a habitat with a gloomy trait.\n- The Unicorn, with its healing horn, is found in a habitat known for its mystical qualities.\n- The Dragon, with its fiery breath, lives in a habitat with a fiery trait.\n- The Pegasus, with its majestic wings, is found in a habitat known for its serenity.\n- The habitat of the Phoenix and the habitat of the Pegasus are adjacent.\n- The Phoenix's habitat is adjacent to the Unicorn's habitat.\n- The habitat of the Dragon is adjacent to the habitat of the Pegasus.\n- The habitat of the Basilisk and the habitat of the Phoenix are not the same.\n- The Unicorn's habitat is known for its mystical qualities.\n- The Pegasus and Griffin are neighbors, but the Basilisk's habitat is not adjacent to the Unicorn's habitat.\n- The habitat of the Phoenix and the habitat of the Basilisk are adjacent.\n\nUsing the clues provided, determine the habitat of each creature.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to determine the habitat of each creature based on the given clues. We'll proceed step-by-step to deduce the correct habitat for each creature.\n\nLet's summarize the key points and constraints:\n\n1. **Habitats:**\n   - Enchanted Forest\n   - Crystal Cave\n   - Mystic Lake\n   - Whispering Meadow\n   - Murky Bog\n   - Blazing Volcano\n\n2. **Creatures:**\n   - Phoenix\n   - Griffin\n   - Basilisk\n   - Unicorn\n   - Dragon\n\n**Given Clues:**\n\n1. Phoenix is reborn from flames and resides in a fiery habitat.\n2. The Griffin prefers the luminous environment of the Crystal Cave.\n3. The Basilisk is a creature with a petrifying gaze, residing in a habitat with a gloomy trait.\n4. The Unicorn is found in a habitat known for its mystical qualities.\n5. The habitat of the Phoenix and the habitat of the Basilisk are adjacent.\n6. The Phoenix's habitat is known for its fiery trait.\n7. The Unicorn is in a habitat known for its serenity and mystical qualities.\n8. The habitat of the Dragon is adjacent to the habitat of the Pegasus.\n9. The Pegasus is found in a habitat known for its serenity.\n10. The habitat of the Basilisk and the habitat of the Phoenix are not the same.\n11. The habitat of the Unicorn is known for its mystical qualities.\n12. The Pegasus and Griffin are neighbors, but the Basilisk's habitat is not adjacent to the Unicorn's habitat.\n\n**Logical deductions:**\n\n1. **Phoenix:**\n   - Has a fiery trait.\n   - Possible habitats: Blazing Volcano (since it's the only habitat with a fiery trait).\n\n2. **Dragon:**\n   - Has a fiery trait (adjacent to Pegasus).\n   - Since Phoenix is in Blazing Volcano, Dragon can only be in another habitat with a fiery trait. However, since the Phoenix is in a fiery habitat, the Dragon must be adjacent to Pegasus.\n   - Possible habitats: Enchanted Forest, Crystal Cave, Mystic Lake, Whispering Meadow, Murky Bog (not Blazing Volcano).\n\n3. **Unicorn:**\n   - Known for mystical qualities.\n   - Possible habitats: Enchanted Forest (magical), Whispering Meadow (serene and mystical), Mystic Lake (mystical).\n\n4. **Pegasus:**\n   - Known for serenity.\n   - Possible habitats: Whispering Meadow (serene).\n\n5. **Griffin:**\n   - Prefers a luminous environment.\n   - Possible habitats: Crystal Cave (luminous).\n\n6. **Basilisk:**\n   - Resides in a gloomy habitat.\n   - Possible habitats: Murky Bog (gloomy).\n\n**Assigning Habitats:**\n\n- **Phoenix:** Blazing Volcano (fiery)\n- **Pegasus:** Whispering Meadow (serene)\n- **Dragon:** Must be adjacent to Whispering Meadow, so it can be in Enchanted Forest or Mystic Lake.\n- **Griffin:** Crystal Cave (luminous)\n- **Unicorn:** Must be in a mystical habitat, leaving Enchanted Forest or Mystic Lake. Since the Dragon is adjacent, it must be Mystic Lake (mystical).\n- **Basilisk:** Murky Bog (gloomy)\n\nSince the Dragon's habitat must be adjacent to the Pegasus, and the Pegasus is in Whispering Meadow, the Dragon must be in Enchanted Forest.\n\nFinally:\n\n- **Phoenix:** Blazing Volcano",

    "context": "### 4.4.14. FTP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ftp}\nFile Transfer Protocol is a relatively simple, text-based protocol for sending files between machines. FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended. SFTP uses an SSH connection to send and receive files over an encrypted\n\nchannel. SFTP also supports all SSH authentication methods.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.4.15. SNMP\"}\n",

A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses\n\noften determine how and if an attack will occur.

Worms, Viruses, and Trojans {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__worms_viruses_and_trojans}\nWorms are self-propagating programs that spread without user interaction. Their code is typically stored within an\n\nindependent object, such as a hidden executable file. Worms often do not severely damage their host, as they are\n\nconcerned with rapid, exponential spreading.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nStuxnet\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nStuxnet was a 2010 worm that specifically targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. The worm used an unprecedented four\n\nzero-day attacks and was designed to spread via USB flash drives and Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). In this way it\n\ndidn't just rely on networks to propagate. Ultimately Stuxnet's payload targeted the code used to program PLC devices\n\nthat control motors and make them spin too fast, destroying the centrifuges. Stuxnet also employed an impressive rootkit\n\nto cover its tracks. Given the level of sophistication Stuxnet is believed to have been developed by the US and Israel.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nViruses typically require user interaction, such as copying and infected file from one machine to another, and store\n\ntheir code inside another file on a machine. An executable file may be infected by having the virus code added a\n\nseparate page that executes before the standard program code. Viruses can be quite damaging to the host as they may take\n\nsignificant resources to spread locally. The term virus is also an unfortunately overloaded one. Due to it's popularity\n\nit is often used by some lower-skill threat actors to refer to many different types of malware.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nConcept Virus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nThe Concept virus was the first example of a Microsoft Word macro virus. The virus hid itself inside Microsoft Word\n\nfiles and used Word's embedded macro language to perform its replication tasks. Viruses were later created for Excel and\n\nother programs that had sufficiently sophisticated yet ultimately insecure internal scripting languages.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nA trojan is a form of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software. It does not have to rely on a software\n\nexploit as much as it exploits users into installing, running, or giving extra privileges to the malicious code. Trojans\n\nare the most popular kind of malware as they can be used as an attack vector for many other payloads. The name comes\n\nfrom Greek mythology, where a Trojan horse was disguised as a gift and given to a besieged town. Within the large horse\n\nwere secret troops who came out in the middle of the night and opened the town gates.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nEmotet\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nEmotet is a banking trojan from 2014 that spread through emails.

Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information.

This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1. CVEs\"}\n",

    "response": "```markdown\n<document_analysis>\nThe provided context involves a detailed exploration of using Scapy for a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack via ARP spoofing. The text discusses setting up an environment for packet interception using tools like `tcpdump` and `Scapy`, and focuses on ARP spoofing to reroute traffic through a controlled interface. It touches on the necessity of understanding how ARP works, how to send and receive ARP packets, and the intricacies of IP networking for successful MitM attacks. The context emphasizes the importance of understanding ARP cache poisoning, ARP spoofing, and the use of tools like `scapy` for network manipulation. The analysis reveals concepts such as ARP cache poisoning and the technicalities of packet forwarding to intercept data. The question aims to test the expert's grasp on implications and applications of the information related to ARP cache poisoning and network security.\n\n## Output\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What are the potential network security implications of ARP spoofing in the context of IPv6 networks, and how could it affect future networking protocols?\n\nA: It could lead to network address conflicts and traffic routing issues, potentially affecting network stability and security.\n\nB: It might allow unauthorized access to sensitive information, compromising data integrity.\n\nC: It could result in IP address conflicts, causing network disruptions.\n\nD: It may cause a breakdown in data encryption processes, leading to security vulnerabilities.\n\nExplanation: ARP spoofing allows attackers to intercept traffic by sending gratuitous ARP responses, which are used to update the ARP cache. In the context of IPv6 networks, similar vulnerabilities could be exploited through Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) spoofing, where attackers could send unsolicited NDP messages, leading to potential security breaches. The correct understanding involves recognizing that ARP spoofing in IPv4 networks can be extended to NDP in IPv6, affecting how NDP spoofing could affect network security in IPv6 networks. This requires a deep understanding of network protocols and the potential for exploitation in emerging technologies.\n\nCorrect Answer: A: It could lead to unauthorized data interception and potential network disruption.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of ARP spoofing, how can ARP cache poisoning be mitigated in modern network environments to prevent such security vulnerabilities, considering the potential for ARP spoofing?\n\nA: By implementing dynamic ARP updates and leveraging intrusion detection systems.\nB: By using static ARP entries to prevent dynamic updates.\nC: Through the use of static ARP entries and frequent network resets.\nD: By employing a combination of DNSSEC and DNSSEC measures.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer involves understanding that ARP cache poisoning can be mitigated with security solutions that provide dynamic ARP cache updates based on legitimate network traffic, making it difficult for attackers to exploit ARP cache poisoning. This requires a nuanced understanding of how to maintain network integrity in the face of ARP spoofing attempts. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>\n``` \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Question Analysis**: The question should provoke thought on the implications of ARP spoofing within the context of ARP cache poisoning.

The other options are designed to test a nuanced understanding of ARP cache poisoning's broader context within network security protocols, making them plausible but subtly incorrect.\n\n- **Answer A**: ARP spoofing\n- **Correct Answer**: ARP spoofing is a technique used to intercept, modify, or stop data packets in a network. The explanation emphasizes the importance of understanding ARP spoofing's role in enabling ARP spoofing, which is crucial for network security and defense strategies.\n\n- **Explanation**: This answer is correct because ARP spoofing is a technique used to intercept, modify, or stop data packets in a network. Understanding ARP poisoning in the context of this text is essential for understanding the technical aspects of ARP spoofing, making ARP cache poisoning a relevant topic in network security.\n\n- **A**: ARP spoofing is used to intercept and modify data packets in a network, enabling ARP cache poisoning to intercept, modify, or stop data packets.

Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

The document emphasizes the complexity of email protocols, highlighting that while SPF and DKIM are important for security, they have limitations and are often paired with DMARC for comprehensive security. This is particularly important for understanding the underlying principles that support the integrity and security of email communications. The document analysis will focus on the nuanced interplay between these methods and their implications for email security.\n</document_analysis>\n\nThe context provides a detailed explanation of DKIM, a cryptographic method used to validate the integrity of emails by signing the messages. DKIM, which uses public and private key cryptography to sign emails, plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of email communications. The document highlights the importance of verifying senders in the email protocol, pointing out the limitations and potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not properly configured. Therefore, the question crafted will require an understanding of the complexities of email security and the specific roles of DKIM and other protocols in maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of email communications.\n\nThe question should challenge an expert to think about the detailed interplay between these methods and their application in ensuring email integrity, particularly focusing on how DKIM fits within the broader framework of email security, which involves SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc. The question will require a synthesis of the document\u2019s content and a broader understanding of the layered security protocols that ensure email integrity, emphasizing the nuanced roles of each method in a layered security approach.\n\n### Strategic Question Design\n\nThe question should:\n\n1. Challenge the expert to think about the nuanced implications of DKIM in the broader context of email security.\n2. Require the synthesis of high-level understanding of DKIM, including how it integrates with other protocols.\n3. Avoid making the answer obvious by ensuring all options are plausible, requiring a deep understanding of the topic.\n4.

DKIM alone ensures full security of email communications.\nB. DKIM, when combined with SPF alone, provides comprehensive security against all forms of email-based attacks.\nC. DKIM, SPF, and DMARC collectively enhance email security by verifying sender identity, reducing but not eliminating the risk of spoofing by integrating multiple layers of defense.\nD. DKIM alone is sufficient to prevent all types of email phishing attacks.\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. **Complexity and Nuance**: The question is designed to be challenging by requiring the expert to integrate knowledge of DKIM, SPF, and DMARC protocols and their roles within a layered security approach. This necessitates a synthesis of knowledge about how each protocol interacts with one another to create a robust security posture.\n2. **Subtlety and Depth**: The incorrect answers are crafted to be plausible but subtly misleading. Answer A suggests that DKIM alone is sufficient, which it is not, while B suggests an incorrect level of security by implying SPF alone with DKIM provides comprehensive security, which it does not. Answer D implies a completeness that is incorrect.\n3. **Correct Answer**: C is the correct answer as it recognizes that DKIM, SPF, and DMARC collectively enhance security by creating multiple layers of defense against spoofing and other threats.\n4. **Educational Impact**: The question requires an understanding of how these protocols work together to enhance the overall security posture against APTs, thus encouraging a deep understanding of their application and implications.\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does the integration of DKIM with SPF and DMARC protocols enhance the security of email communications in mitigating the risk of advanced persistent threats (APTs) in an organization?\n\nA.

Protocols\"}\n\n\n# 4. Protocols {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__protocols}\nProtocols can be though of as rules that dictate communication. A protocol may include information about the syntax\n\nused, error correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication occurs in the context of that\n\nsituation. In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses\n\noften determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed\n\nvia individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for\n\nComments (RFCs). You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. [Some of the earliest web\n\nprotocols are detailed in RFCs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616){.link} More often than not, large\n\nprotocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the [Institute of Electrical and\n\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/){.link} which handles WiFi protocols. These groups publish papers\n\ndetailing how the protocols work.\n\nThis chapter will give a brief description of important protocols following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important\n\nto note that some of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks. In this case they will be grouped\n\naccording to which layer they largely function within.\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"4.1. Network Access Layer\"}\n",

SSH Keys\"}\n\n\n### 7.3.7. SSH Keys {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ssh_keys}\nSecure Shell Server (SSH) supports the use of asymmetric encryption keys for authentication. Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data. This bit of data is useless to the MitM.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.8. Sessions and Cookies\"}\n",

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed.

The woods were known for their enchanting beauty, but they also harbored mysteries that were both alluring and daunting. Elara, with her curious nature, was drawn to the woods more than anyone else in the village of Elderglen.\n\nElara was not like the other children; she had an innate ability to understand the language of the woods. As a child, she would spend hours talking to the trees, listening to the leaves rustle with the stories of the past. Her parents, though worried at first, came to appreciate her unique gift.\n\nOne crisp autumn morning, as the leaves painted the ground in shades of amber and gold, Elara ventured deeper into the woods than she ever had before. A peculiar whisper had caught her attention\u2014a soft, urgent plea that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest.\n\nFollowing the sound, she found herself standing before a massive oak tree, its bark twisted and gnarled, with a hollow that seemed to beckon her closer. Inside, nestled among the roots, lay a small, ornate box. Elara reached out and opened it, revealing a delicate silver locket that glowed faintly with an ethereal light.\n\nAs she touched the locket, a vision flooded her mind\u2014a memory not her own. It was of a young woman, much like herself, who had once been the guardian of the Whispering Woods. This guardian had been entrusted with protecting the heart of the forest, a magical crystal that balanced nature's forces.\n\nThe vision revealed that the crystal had been stolen by a shadowy figure, plunging the woods into a state of unrest. The trees whispered of their suffering, their leaves no longer vibrant, their branches brittle. The forest was in peril, and only the rightful guardian could restore balance.\n\nElara felt a surge of determination. She closed the locket, now understanding her purpose. She had to find the crystal and return it to its rightful place. With the locket around her neck, she set off on a quest, guided by the whispers of the woods.\n\nHer journey took her through dense thickets, across babbling brooks, and into the depths of the forest where light seldom touched the ground. Along the way, she encountered various creatures\u2014some helpful, others hindering. A wise old owl provided her with riddles that hinted at the crystal's location, while a mischievous fox attempted to lead her astray.\n\nAs Elara delved deeper, she began to notice changes within herself. The locket seemed to amplify her connection to the woods, allowing her to communicate more clearly with its inhabitants. She felt their gratitude and hope, and it fueled her resolve.\n\nFinally, she reached a hidden glade, bathed in moonlight, where the crystal was kept. But guarding it was the shadowy figure from her vision, a being of darkness and malice. It was the spirit of greed, seeking to harness the crystal's power for its own gain.\n\nA fierce battle ensued, with Elara using her newfound abilities to outwit and outmaneuver the shadow. She called upon the creatures of the woods for aid, and together, they overwhelmed the spirit, binding it once more to the shadows from whence it came.\n\nWith the crystal restored to its rightful place, the woods began to heal. The trees stood tall and proud, their leaves a vibrant green, and the air was filled with the songs of birds. Elara had fulfilled her destiny, becoming the new guardian of the Whispering Woods.\n\nAs she returned to Elderglen, the villagers noticed the change in the woods and marveled at their restored beauty. Elara, now a young woman, continued to live in harmony with the forest, her heart forever intertwined with its secrets and wonders.\n\nAnd so, the Whispering Woods remained a place of enchantment, protected by the courage and love of its guardian, Elara, who had answered the call of the woods and become one with its eternal whisper.",

When the ransom is paid, typically via cryptocurrency,\n\nthe threat actor can decrypt the symmetric key using their private key and the user can use the symmetric key to decrypt\n\nthe files.\n\nRansomware is considered a data breach in the data is often exfiltrated as well. It is also worth noting that when the\n\nransom is paid, there is no guarantee that the threat actor will actually begin the decryption process. Typical targets\n\nof ransomware include corporate infrastructure and health care systems although ransomware may also be spread\n\nindeterminately.

Every file in a Unix system has an owner and a group. Each file also has permissions for owner, group, and\n\nall users. Permissions are set using octal numbers where each bit represents read (bit 0: 1), write (bit 1: 2), or\n\nexecute (bit 2: 4) permission.\n\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/permissions.svg\" alt=\"permissions\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nFor example, if you wanted a read and execute permission the number would be 5 (1 + 4). Read and write permission would\n\nbe 3 (1 + 2).\n\nPermissions are specified with the `chmod`{.literal} command, the first octal number is the permissions for the owner,\n\nthe second is for the group, and the third is for all user. So to change a file to have read, write, and execute\n\npermissions for the owner, read permissions for the group, and no permissions for everyone else, the command would be\n\n`chmod 710 <filename>`{.literal} where `<filename>`{.literal} is the name of your file.\n\nThe owner and group of a file can be set with the `chown`{.literal} command:\n\n`chown <owner>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. If `<group>`{.literal} is not specified only the owner is changed.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.6. ACLs\"}\n",

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

They tend to be based on a\n\nsimple characteristic and either deny access to anyone not on the list, *allowlist*, or deny access to anyone who *is*\n\non the list, *denylist*.\n\nACLs used in networking and typically filter based on IP address. You can find examples of ACLs in most firewall\n\nproducts as well as in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).\n\nFilesystem ACLs apply the same concept to files. Linux uses fileystem ACLs to permit or deny access in a more nuanced\n\nway than possible with [Unix File\n\nPermissions](#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__unix_file_permissions){#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml_xref-_unix_file_permissions\n\n.xref}.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.7.

Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data. This bit of data is useless to the MitM.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.8. Sessions and Cookies\"}\n",

    "context": "## Remote Shells\n::: content\n\nAs you have hopefully experienced by completing the labs, Linux systems traditionally have a powerful shell system that\n\nuses text commands to control the OS. Through the shell you can create, read, update, or delete files, make network\n\nconnections, configure kernel parameters, install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells that\n\ncan be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an\n\nattacker would need to have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is being able to interact\n\nwith a shell remotely on the exploited machine.\n\nIn this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect. In these instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out\n\nfrom the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the inside*. This is more compatible with the\n\nfirewalls/NAT routers that sit between most devices and the Internet.\n\nIn either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote connection allows an attacker to basically do\n\nanything they want. To that end, many tools have sprung up to provide remote shell access. A machine may already have a\n\nremote shell tool installed, such as an SSH server. Barring that [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/){.link} can be\n\nused with any executable to provide access to it over a network. [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/){.link} (a\n\nvery popular pentesting framework) comes with many payloads, most of which are shells of various types. Programs also\n\nexist to run shells over ICMP, Discord, IRC, or even DNS!\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n:::::::::\n\n::::::::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"5.7. Lab: MitM with Scapy\"}\n",

This is due largely to its popularity as\n\na desktop operating system. The second largest target is web browsers, which afford malware a unique cross-platform\n\nreach. The third largest target is the Android mobile operating system, which while technically Linux runs mostly on\n\nmobile phones. Both Linux and Mac do not receive as much malware attention. While this may be partially due to the\n\nopen-source nature of Linux and the BSD kernel used by Macs, it is also partially due to the lack of popularity of each\n\nof these operating systems. Malware is often widely distributed, meaning it can target only the most popular/possibly\n\nweakest links and still be successful.\n\n:::\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Zero Days\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n",
