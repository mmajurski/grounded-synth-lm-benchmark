    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Jungle BookThe Jungle Book (1894) is a collection of stories by English author Rudyard Kipling. The stories were first published in magazines in 1893\u201394. The original publications contain illustrations, some by the author's father, John Lockwood Kipling. Kipling was born in India and spent the first six years of his childhood there. After about ten years in England, he went back to India and worked there for about six-and-a-half years. These stories were written when Kipling lived in Naulakha, the home he built in Dummerston, Vermont (just north of Brattleboro), in the United States.  There is evidence that the collection of stories was written for his daughter Josephine, who died in 1899 at six years of age by pneumonia; a rare first edition of the book with a poignant handwritten note by the author to his young daughter was discovered at the National Trust's Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire in 2010.  [PAR] The tales in the book (as well as those in The Second Jungle Book which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. The verses of The Law of the Jungle, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families, and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or \"heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle.\"  Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time.  The best-known of them are the three stories revolving around the adventures of Mowgli, an abandoned \"man cub\" who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. The most famous of the other four stories are probably \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\", the story of a heroic mongoose, and \"Toomai of the Elephants\", the tale of a young elephant-handler. As with much of Kipling's work, each of the stories is followed by a piece of verse. [PAR] The Jungle Book came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts, a junior element of the Scouting movement. This use of the book's universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author's permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement, the name being traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack. [PAR] Chapters [PAR] The complete book, having passed into the public domain, is on-line at Project Gutenberg's official website and elsewhere. Each of the even-numbered items below is an epigrammatic poem related to the preceding story. [PAR] # \"Mowgli's Brothers\": A boy is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle with the help of Baloo the bear and Bagheera the black panther, and then has to fight the tiger Shere Khan. This story has also been published as a short book in its own right: Night-Song in the Jungle. [PAR] # \"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\". [PAR] # \"Kaa's Hunting\": This story takes place before Mowgli fights Shere Khan. When Mowgli is abducted by monkeys, Baloo and Bagheera set out to rescue him with the aid of Chil the kite and Kaa the python. Maxims of Baloo. [PAR] # \"Road Song of the Bandar-Log\". [PAR] # \"Tiger! Tiger!\": Mowgli returns to the human village and is adopted by Messua and her husband who believe him to be their long-lost son Nathoo.

[PAR] Background [PAR] Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) was born in the village of Sontsovka in the Donets region of the Ukraine.\u00a0 He was a child prodigy on the order of Mozart, composing for piano at age five and writing an opera at nine.\u00a0 His first teacher was his mother, a talented pianist.\u00a0 He attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory from 1904 to 1914, winning the Anton Rubinstein prize for best student pianist when he graduated.\u00a0 He traveled widely, spending many years in London and Paris, and toured the United States five times. [PAR] In 1936, Prokofiev returned to settle permanently in the Soviet Union.\u00a0 One of his first compositions after his return was Peter and the Wolf, written in just two weeks in April of 1936 for a children's theater in Moscow.\u00a0 Prokofiev invented the story and wrote the narration himself, drawing on memories of his own childhood.\u00a0 He constructed the music as a child's introduction to the orchestra, with each character in the story represented by a different instrument or group of instruments: Peter by the strings, the bird by the flute, the duck by the oboe, the cat by the clarinet, the wolf by the horn section, and so on. [PAR] Peter and the Wolf was an immediate success and has been loved by children all over the world.\u00a0 The music is sophisticated enough to be enjoyed by adults, even through repeated hearings.\u00a0 And its moral \u0097 you can't be a hero if you don't take risks \u0097 delights children as it must have cheered the composer. [PAR] Musical Themes [PAR] Prokofiev's Original Story [PAR] Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and walked out into the big green meadow. [PAR] On a branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend. \"All is quiet\" chirped the bird happily. [PAR] Just then a duck came waddling round. She was glad that Peter had not closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow. [PAR] Seeing the duck, the little bird flew down upon on the grass, settled next to her and shrugged his shoulders. \"What kind of bird are you if you can't fly?\" said he. To this the duck replied \"What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?\" and dived into the pond. [PAR] They argued and argued, the duck swimming in the pond and the little bird hopping along the shore. [PAR] Suddenly, something caught Peter's attention. He noticed a cat crawling through the grass. [PAR] The cat thought; \"That little bird is busy arguing, I'll just grab him. Stealthily, the cat crept towards him on her velvet paws. [PAR] \"Look out!\" shouted Peter and the bird immediately flew up into the tree, while the duck quacked angrily at the cat, from the middle of the pond. The cat walked around the tree and thought, \"Is it worth climbing up so high?\u00a0 By the time I get there the bird will have flown away.\" [PAR] Just then grandfather came out. He was upset because Peter had gone in the meadow. \"It's a dangerous place.

Though the origins of curling are unclear, most people regard Scotland as curling\u2019s birthplace. Today, curling is played around the world, largely thanks to its introduction into the Olympics in 1988. Because curling can seem complicated if you don\u2019t know a lot about it, these articles help to explain the basics, from curling terminology and the roles of each position on a team, to how scoring and other elements of the game work, and why curling is such a great sport to play. [PAR] Curling Match Terminology [PAR] Curling, probably more than any other sport, has its own unique terminology (like hurry hard and burning a rock, among others). Here are the key curling words and phrases you need to know to blend in at your next bonspiel: [PAR] Blank end: An end where no points are scored. [PAR] Bonspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete. [PAR] Burning a rock: A rules infraction that happens when a player touches a stone as it\u2019s traveling down the sheet. [PAR] Button: The very center of the target rings or house. [PAR] Cashspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete for money. [PAR] Delivery: The action of throwing a stone to the other end of the playing surface. [PAR] Eight-ender: A perfect end where every one of the team\u2019s stones scores a point. [PAR] End: The way a curling game is divided. An end is like an inning in a baseball game. A curling game has either eight or ten ends. [PAR] Gripper: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you keep your footing on the ice. See slider. [PAR] Hammer: The last rock of the end. [PAR] Hack: The foothold in the ice you use to push off from when you deliver the stone. [PAR] House: Also known as the rings, this is the name of the giant bull\u2019s eye at either end of the sheet of ice. It consists of a set of concentric circles, called the 12-foot, 8-foot, 4-foot, and the Button. [PAR] Hurry hard: A directive given to sweepers by the skip or third, to begin sweeping. [PAR] Rink: A curling team; also the name of a curling facility [PAR] Rock: Also known as a stone, the granite playing utensil that a curler delivers. Regular-sized rocks weigh approximately 44 pounds. [PAR] Sheet: The frozen playing surface on which the game is played. [PAR] Slider: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you move or slide along the ice. [PAR] Tee line: The line on the playing surface that runs through the middle of the house. [PAR] Weight: The amount of force used to deliver a stone. [PAR] The Members of a Curling Team [PAR] In curling, the team you play on is called a rink. The rink is made up of four players: the lead, the second, the third (also called the vice, vice-skip, or mate), and the skip. Each player has specific duties: [PAR] Lead: The lead throws the first two rocks of the end and then sweeps the next six. The lead must be very good at throwing guards and a strong sweeper. [PAR] Second: The second throws the third and fourth stones of the end and should be strong at playing takeouts. The second sweeps the first two stones and then the final four of the end. The second and the lead need to be in sync when sweeping together. [PAR] Third: The third (or mate or vice), who throws the fifth and sixth rocks of the end, must be good at all shots, but especially draws. It is the third\u2019s job to set up the shots that will be thrown by the skip, and to help the skip discuss the strategy of the final two stones of the end. The third also posts the score at the conclusion of the end",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Tower BridgeTower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built in 1886\u20131894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets. [PAR] The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. [PAR] The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway. The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge. [PAR] History [PAR] Inception [PAR] In the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the East End of London led to a requirement for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London. [PAR] A Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect (who was also one of the judges),  was approved. [PAR] Jones' engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry, devised the idea of a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. [PAR] Construction [PAR] Construction started in 1887 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.  \u2013 and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. [PAR] Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance. [PAR] Jones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa\u00e7ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was \u00a31,184,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ). [PAR] Opening [PAR] The bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife, The Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark).

And he should be brainy \u2013 he should have little grey cells of the mind. [PAR] Agatha Christie - An Autobiography [PAR] About Hercule Poirot [PAR] The Beginning [PAR] Hercule Poirot came into existence during World War I. Agatha Christie was working as a VAD in Torquay, and encountered on a daily basis Belgian refugees arriving in England from the continent. Searching for a detective for her first novel, she set upon the idea of creating a Belgian detective who had been \"a former shining light of the Belgian police force\", before being forced out of his country. [PAR] Christie completed The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, but it wasn\u2019t published until four years later. In the novel, Poirot is called upon by his old friend Lieutenant Hastings, who would come to be the Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Christie later wrote that Poirot's introduction to detective fiction was not at all how he himself would have liked. \"Hercule Poirot first,\" he would have said, \"and then a plot to display his remarkable talents to their best advantage.\" [PAR] A Great Man [PAR] Poirot would be the first to call himself a great man - he has never been known for his modesty - but with such success in his career, it is difficult to argue with him. He finishes each case with a dramatic d\u00e9nouement, satisfying his own ego and confirming to all that he is truly \"the greatest mind in Europe.\" His love of elegance, beauty, and precision, as well as his eccentric mannerisms are often ridiculed by the local bumbling policemen, but it is always Poirot who has the last word. [PAR] My name is Hercule Poirot, and I am probably the greatest detective in the world. [PAR] Hercule Poirot, The Mystery of the Blue Train [PAR] Agatha Christie never imagined how popular Poirot would become, nor how many stories she would write about him. He stars in 33 novels and 54 short stories, including some of Christie's most successful such as Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile . [PAR] Poirot and Christie [PAR] One of Christie\u2019s later regrets was that Hercule Poirot began his literary life too mature: \"the result is that my fictional detective is well over a hundred by now.\" And it is no secret that character and author did not always see eye to eye. [PAR] \u201cThere are moments when I have felt: \u2018Why-why-why did I ever invent this detestable, bombastic, tiresome little creature?\u2019\u2026. But now, I must confess it, Hercule Poirot has won. A reluctant affection has sprung up for him\u2026\u201d Agatha Christie\u2019s introduction to the serialisation of Appointment With Death in the Daily Mail, 1938. [PAR] Christie grew tired of Poirot's idiosyncrasies so much so that she wrote Curtain: Poirot's Last Case in the 1940s. It was locked in a safe until 1974 when it was finally published, earning Poirot a well-deserved obituary in The New York Times; he is the only fictional character to have received such an honour. [PAR] Playing Poirot [PAR] The first actor to take on the role of the little Belgian was Charles Laughton in 1928 in the theatrical debut of Alibi. Austin Trevor was the first Poirot on screen in 1931, and went on to star in three films. There was Tony Randall in 1965 and Academy Award nominee Albert Finney in the all-star classic Murder on the Orient Express in 1974. The great Peter Ustinov, winner of two Academy Awards, played Poirot in six films and despite not physically resembling the character is still much loved worldwide. There was even a Japanese anim\u00e9 version of Poirot, broadcast in 2004. [PAR] Perhaps, however, the actor most synonymous with Hercule Poirot is David Suchet, who first took on the role in 1989.

[PAR] Background [PAR] Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) was born in the village of Sontsovka in the Donets region of the Ukraine.\u00a0 He was a child prodigy on the order of Mozart, composing for piano at age five and writing an opera at nine.\u00a0 His first teacher was his mother, a talented pianist.\u00a0 He attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory from 1904 to 1914, winning the Anton Rubinstein prize for best student pianist when he graduated.\u00a0 He traveled widely, spending many years in London and Paris, and toured the United States five times. [PAR] In 1936, Prokofiev returned to settle permanently in the Soviet Union.\u00a0 One of his first compositions after his return was Peter and the Wolf, written in just two weeks in April of 1936 for a children's theater in Moscow.\u00a0 Prokofiev invented the story and wrote the narration himself, drawing on memories of his own childhood.\u00a0 He constructed the music as a child's introduction to the orchestra, with each character in the story represented by a different instrument or group of instruments: Peter by the strings, the bird by the flute, the duck by the oboe, the cat by the clarinet, the wolf by the horn section, and so on. [PAR] Peter and the Wolf was an immediate success and has been loved by children all over the world.\u00a0 The music is sophisticated enough to be enjoyed by adults, even through repeated hearings.\u00a0 And its moral \u0097 you can't be a hero if you don't take risks \u0097 delights children as it must have cheered the composer. [PAR] Musical Themes [PAR] Prokofiev's Original Story [PAR] Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and walked out into the big green meadow. [PAR] On a branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend. \"All is quiet\" chirped the bird happily. [PAR] Just then a duck came waddling round. She was glad that Peter had not closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow. [PAR] Seeing the duck, the little bird flew down upon on the grass, settled next to her and shrugged his shoulders. \"What kind of bird are you if you can't fly?\" said he. To this the duck replied \"What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?\" and dived into the pond. [PAR] They argued and argued, the duck swimming in the pond and the little bird hopping along the shore. [PAR] Suddenly, something caught Peter's attention. He noticed a cat crawling through the grass. [PAR] The cat thought; \"That little bird is busy arguing, I'll just grab him. Stealthily, the cat crept towards him on her velvet paws. [PAR] \"Look out!\" shouted Peter and the bird immediately flew up into the tree, while the duck quacked angrily at the cat, from the middle of the pond. The cat walked around the tree and thought, \"Is it worth climbing up so high?\u00a0 By the time I get there the bird will have flown away.\" [PAR] Just then grandfather came out. He was upset because Peter had gone in the meadow. \"It's a dangerous place. If a wolf should come out of the forest, then what would you do?\" [PAR] But Peter paid no attention to his grandfather's words. Boys like him are not afraid of wolves. [PAR] But",

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for females, and this section will discuss about the 3 main types of female voices, their respective note ranges, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One point to note: There is a difference between the 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type; The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that the voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas Voice Type refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to learn how to find the full range of your voice, as well as understand more about the various voice classification criteria and learn how to determine your own voice type! [PAR] Now, the 3 main types of female voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Soprano [PAR] Let us look at each of these voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. SOPRANO [PAR] As many of us would know, the Soprano voice is the highest of the female voices, and many of us would be familiar with this voice type. I am sure many ladies out there would be envious of their Soprano friends who seem to be able to hit the high notes with such ease! [PAR] A typical Soprano vocal range would probably be from the A note below middle C (A3) to the F or G note 2 octaves above (F6 or G6), making it a range of 2 plus to 3 octaves. Of course, this is not to be taken as an exact measurement but more as a rough guideline for soprano voices, and proper breath support must be used when measuring vocal ranges during singing. [PAR] The Soprano Tessitura is also usually higher than the other female voice types, considering that the overall vocal range is the highest among the female voices. [PAR] A Soprano would also probably transition out of her chest voice around the E flat note above middle C (E4) and shift into her head voice around the F sharp note one octave above the middle C (F5). [PAR] The soprano voice usually has a bright tone, and she would usually have a strong head voice, but a relatively weaker middle voice. Sopranos are also able to sing more high notes and sustain at a high pitch better than a mezzo soprano can, and they are also most often the lead role for operas or shows. [PAR] 2. MEZZO SOPRANO [PAR] For most ladies out there, you would probably belong to this voice type as the Mezzo Soprano voice is the most common female voice type out of the 3 main types, and it lies between the higher Soprano voice and the lower Contralto voice. [PAR] The vocal range for the Mezzo Soprano voice would be likely between the G note below middle C (G3) to the C note more than 2 octaves above (C6), making it also a range of around slightly",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak. As Tex, his horse, and dog are very thirsty, Kalamakooya",

The series was originally broadcast from 1964 to 1971 on  ORTF (Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise). [PAR] Having originally rejected the series as \"charming... but difficult to dub into English\", the BBC later produced a version of the series using the original stop motion animation footage with new English-language scripts, written and narrated by Eric Thompson, which bore little relation to the original storylines. This version, broadcast in 441 five-minute-long episodes from 18 October 1965 to 25 January 1977, was a great success and attained cult status, and when in 1967 it was moved from the slot just before the evening news to an earlier children's viewing time, adult viewers complained to the BBC. [PAR] Characters [PAR] Although the characters are common to both versions, they were given different names and personalities depending on the language. [PAR] The main character is Dougal (Pollux in the original French-language version) who was a drop-eared variety of the Skye Terrier. [PAR] In the French version, Pollux is a British character who speaks somewhat broken French with an outrageous English accent as a result of Ivor Wood's role as co-creator. His sweet tooth, shown through his fondness for sugar lumps, was based on a French belief that one of the traits of the English is a liking for sweets. [PAR] Other characters include Zebedee (Z\u00e9bulon), a jack-in-the-box; Brian (Ambroise), a snail; Ermintrude (Azal\u00e9e), a cow, and Dylan (named after Bob Dylan[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/591175/ Magic Roundabout, The (1965\u201377)] BFI Screenonline. Retrieved 23 August 2013.) (Flappy) a rabbit, who in the French version was Spanish. There are two notable human characters: Florence (Margote), a young girl; and Mr Rusty (le P\u00e8re Pivoine), the elderly moustachioed operator of the roundabout (making him the second character to sport primarily a moustache, after Zebedee). Other less well known human characters, only seen on the roundabout itself during the credits, are Basil, Paul and Rosalie. There is also an adult character, old Mr McHenry (Jouvence Pio) the gardener who is seen only a couple of times. He is the only bearded character in the show and, despite his name and appearance, is Irish, not Scottish. [PAR] The show has a distinctive visual style. The set is a brightly coloured and stylised park containing the eponymous roundabout (a fairground carousel). The programmes were created by stop motion animation, which meant that Dougal was made without legs to make him easier to animate. Zebedee was created from a giant pea which was available in the animation studio and was re-painted. The look of these characters was the responsibility of British animator Ivor Wood, who was working at Danot's studio at the time (and who subsequently animated The Herbs, Paddington Bear and Postman Pat). [PAR] English-language version [PAR] The British (BBC) version was especially distinct from the French version in that the narration was entirely new, created by Eric Thompson from just the visuals, and not based on the script by Serge Danot. A former BBC employee, interviewed on BBC Radio in 2008, maintained that the original contract with the French owners did not include the scripts that accompanied the original animations (contrary to BBC assumptions). The BBC, instead of making a further payment to acquire the scripts, which would have required translation, decided to commission its own version\u00a0\u2013 without access to the original French, and the English-language version therefore bears no resemblance to it. [PAR] The first British broadcasts were shown just before the 5.55\u00a0pm news every weekday on BBC 1, This was the first time an entertainment programme had been transmitted in this way in the UK.

Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927\u201328 period. The ceremony ran for 15\u00a0minutes. [PAR] Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00\u00a0pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until an occasion when the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.

He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. [PAR] At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award. [PAR] The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Jungle BookThe Jungle Book (1894) is a collection of stories by English author Rudyard Kipling. The stories were first published in magazines in 1893\u201394. The original publications contain illustrations, some by the author's father, John Lockwood Kipling. Kipling was born in India and spent the first six years of his childhood there. After about ten years in England, he went back to India and worked there for about six-and-a-half years. These stories were written when Kipling lived in Naulakha, the home he built in Dummerston, Vermont (just north of Brattleboro), in the United States.  There is evidence that the collection of stories was written for his daughter Josephine, who died in 1899 at six years of age by pneumonia; a rare first edition of the book with a poignant handwritten note by the author to his young daughter was discovered at the National Trust's Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire in 2010.  [PAR] The tales in the book (as well as those in The Second Jungle Book which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. The verses of The Law of the Jungle, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families, and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or \"heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle.\"  Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time.  The best-known of them are the three stories revolving around the adventures of Mowgli, an abandoned \"man cub\" who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. The most famous of the other four stories are probably \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\", the story of a heroic mongoose, and \"Toomai of the Elephants\", the tale of a young elephant-handler. As with much of Kipling's work, each of the stories is followed by a piece of verse. [PAR] The Jungle Book came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts, a junior element of the Scouting movement. This use of the book's universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author's permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement, the name being traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.

Fortunately for Leto her first child, Artemis, was birthed without any pain. However Leto had twins so her labor continued, and as weak as she was the newborn Artemis quickly took the roll as midwife and helped birth her twin brother Apollo.

Nokia builds bridges between people--both when they are far apart and face-to-face--and also bridges the gap between people and the information they need. [PAR] History of Nokia Corporation [PAR] Nokia Corporation is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, serving customers in 130 countries. Nokia is divided into four business groups: Mobile Phones, Multimedia, Enterprise Solutions, and Networks. The Mobile Phones group markets wireless voice and data products in consumer and corporate markets. The Multimedia segment sells mobile gaming devices, home satellite systems, and cable television set-top boxes. The Enterprise Solutions group develops wireless systems for use in the corporate sector. Wireless switching and transmission equipment is sold through the company's Networks division. Nokia operates 15 manufacturing facilities in nine countries and maintains research and development facilities in 12 countries. [PAR] 19th-Century Origins [PAR] Originally a manufacturer of pulp and paper, Nokia was founded as Nokia Company in 1865 in a small town of the same name in central Finland. Nokia was a pioneer in the industry and introduced many new production methods to a country with only one major natural resource, its vast forests. As the industry became increasingly energy-intensive, the company even constructed its own power plants. But for many years, Nokia remained an important yet static firm in a relatively forgotten corner of northern Europe. Nokia shares were first listed on the Helsinki exchange in 1915. [PAR] The first major changes in Nokia occurred several years after World War II. Despite its proximity to the Soviet Union, Finland has always remained economically connected with Scandinavian and other Western countries, and as Finnish trade expanded Nokia became a leading exporter. [PAR] During the early 1960s Nokia began to diversify in an attempt to transform the company into a regional conglomerate with interests beyond Finnish borders. Unable to initiate strong internal growth, Nokia turned its attention to acquisitions. The government, however, hoping to rationalize two underperforming basic industries, favored Nokia's expansion within the country and encouraged its eventual merger with Finnish Rubber Works, which was founded in 1898, and Finnish Cable Works, which was formed in 1912, to form Nokia Corporation. When the amalgamation was completed in 1966, Nokia was involved in several new industries, including integrated cable operations, electronics, tires, and rubber footwear, and had made its first public share offering. [PAR] In 1967 Nokia set up a division to develop design and manufacturing capabilities in data processing, industrial automation, and communications systems. The division was later expanded and made into several divisions, which then concentrated on developing information systems, including personal computers and workstations, digital communications systems, and mobile phones. Nokia also gained a strong position in modems and automatic banking systems in Scandinavia. [PAR] Oil Crisis, Corporate Changes: 1970s [PAR] Nokia continued to operate in a stable but parochial manner until 1973, when it was affected in a unique way by the oil crisis. Years of political accommodation between Finland and the Soviet Union ensured Finnish neutrality in exchange for lucrative trade agreements with the Soviets, mainly Finnish lumber products and machinery in exchange for Soviet oil. By agreement, this trade was kept strictly in balance. But when world oil prices began to rise, the market price for Soviet oil rose with it. Balanced trade began to mean greatly reduced purchasing power for Finnish companies such as Nokia. [PAR] Although the effects were not catastrophic, the oil crisis did force Nokia to reassess its reliance on Soviet trade (about 12 percent of sales) as well as its international growth strategies. Several contingency plans were drawn up, but the greatest changes came after the company appointed a new CEO, Kari Kairamo, in 1975. [PAR] Kairamo noted the obvious: Nokia was too big for Finland. The company had to expand abroad. He studied the expansion of other Scandinavian companies",

While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation.

The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit). However, in Italy Mario Monti declared Italian Lira banknotes unredeemable for euros some months before the regular expiration of the 10-year term, and this is also true when the banknotes were lost before and then are found after",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity. [PAR] Description [PAR] The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe  in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),   along with tiny traces of",

[PAR] The Football League, also known as the npower Football League for sponsorship reasons, is a league competition featuring professional association football clubs from England and Wales. [PAR] Founded in 1888, it is the oldest such competition in world football. It was the top level football league in England from its foundation until 1992. [PAR] Since 1995 it has had 72 clubs evenly divided into three divisions, which are currently known as The Championship, League One and League Two. Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest placed clubs in the Premier League. [PAR] A director of Aston Villa, William McGregor, was the first to set out to bring some order to a chaotic world where clubs arranged their own fixtures. On March 2, 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. [PAR] The first meeting was held at Anderson's Hotel in London on March 23, 1888, on the eve of the FA Cup Final. The Football League was formally created and named in Manchester at a further meeting on April 17 at the Royal Hotel. [PAR] In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League to take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal and on May 27, 1992, the Premier League as we know it today was formed. [PAR] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. [PAR] There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions. [PAR] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon. [PAR] A total of 43 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992 until the end of the 2009/10 season. Two other clubs (Luton Town and Notts County) were signatories to the original agreement that created the Premier League, but were relegated prior to the inaugural Premier League season and have not subsequently returned to the top flight. [PAR] Seven clubs have been members of the Premier League for every season since its inception. This group is composed of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. [PAR] Due to insistence by Fifa that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. [PAR] On June 8, 2006, Fifa requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007/08 season.

Many of these changes to city names were done to make those names reflect the linguistic systems in the various areas. [PAR] The following is a brief history of some of India's most famous name changes: [PAR] Mumbai vs. Bombay [PAR] Mumbai is one of the world's ten largest cities today and is located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. This world-class city wasn't always known by this name however. Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay, which has its origins in the 1600s with the Portuguese. During their colonization of the area, they began calling it Bombaim - Portuguese for \"Good Bay.\" In 1661 though, this Portuguese colony was given to King Charles II of England after he married the Portuguese princess Catherine de Braganza. When the British then took control of the colony, its name became Bombay- an anglicized version of Bombaim. [PAR] The name Bombay then stuck until 1996 when the Indian government changed it to Mumbai. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] It is believed that this was the name of a Kolis settlement in the same area because many Kolis communities were named after their Hindu deities. By the early 20th Century, one of these settlements was named Mumbadevi for a goddess of the same name. [PAR] Therefore the change to the name of Mumbai in 1996 was an attempt to use the previous Hindi names for a city that was once controlled by the British. The use of the name Mumbai reached a global scale in 2006 when the Associated Press announced it would refer to what was once Bombay as Mumbai. [PAR] Chennai vs. Madras [PAR] However, Mumbai was not the only newly named Indian city in 1996. In August of that same year, the former city of Madras, located in the state of Tamil Nadu, had its name changed to Chennai. [PAR] Both the names Chennai and Madras date back to 1639. In that year, the Raja of Chandragiri, (a suburb in South India), allowed the British East India Company to build a fort near the town of Madraspattinam. At the same time, the local people built another town close to the site of the fort. This town was named Chennappatnam, after the father of one of the early rulers. Later, both the fort and the town grew together but the British shortened their colony's name to Madras while the Indians changed theirs to Chennai. [PAR] The name Madras (shortened from Madraspattinam) also has links to the Portuguese who were present in the area as early as the 1500s. Their exact impact on the naming of the area is unclear however and many rumors exist as to how the name really originated. Many historians believe that it may have come from the Madeiros family who lived there in the 1500s. [PAR] No matter where it originated though, Madras is a much older name than Chennai. Despite that fact, the city was still renamed Chennai because it is in the language of the area\u2019s original inhabitants and Madras was seen as being a Portuguese name and/or was associated with the former British colony. [PAR] Kolkata vs. Calcutta [PAR] More recently, in January 2001, one of the world's 25 largest cities, Calcutta, became Kolkata. At the same time the city\u2019s name changed, its state changed from West Bengal to Bangla as well. Like Madras, the origin of the name Kolkata is disputed. One belief is that it is derived from in the name Kalikata - one of three villages present in the area where the city is today before the British arrived. The name Kalikata itself is derived from the Hindu goddess",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical noteIn music, the term note has three primary meanings: [PAR] #A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound (\u266a, \u266b); [PAR] #A pitched sound itself. [PAR] #A pitch class. [PAR] Notes are the \"atoms\" of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.  [PAR] The term note can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\".  In the former case, one uses note to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: Key signature names and translations.) [PAR] Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class. [PAR] In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si, including for instance Italy, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details).  [PAR] The eighth note, or octave, is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of scientific pitch notation combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440\u00a0Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4. [PAR] There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the Helmholtz pitch notation and the scientific pitch notation. [PAR] Accidentals  [PAR] Letter names are modified by the accidentals. A sharp  raises a note by a semitone or half-step, and a flat  lowers it by the same amount. In modern tuning a half step has a frequency ratio of \\sqrt[12]{2}, approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F represents F-sharp, B is B-flat. [PAR] Additional accidentals are the double-sharp , raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat , lowering it by that amount. [PAR] In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the key signature, which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the natural symbol , is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G-sharp, a local flat before a G makes it G-flat (not G natural), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat () to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp  sign on a key signature with a single sharp  indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp. [PAR] Assuming enharmonicity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B is equal to the note C. Assuming",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The King and IThe King and I is a musical, the fifth by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II.  It is based on the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon, which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s.  The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country.  The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love that neither can admit.  The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St. James Theatre.  It ran nearly three years, then the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history, and has had many tours and revivals. [PAR] In 1950, theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client, veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence.  Holtzmann realized that Landon's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein, who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical.  The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King, a role that he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon's book, but he was unavailable.  They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner. [PAR] The musical was an immediate hit, winning Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Actress (for Lawrence) and Best Featured Actor (for Brynner).  Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening, and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances.  A hit London run and U.S. national tour followed, together with a 1956 film for which Brynner won an Academy Award, and the musical was recorded several times.  In later revivals, Brynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in a 1985 Broadway run shortly before his death. [PAR] Christopher Renshaw directed major revivals on Broadway (1996), winning the  Tony Award for Best Revival, and in the West End (2000). A 2015 Broadway revival won another Tony for Best Revival. Both professional and amateur revivals of The King and I continue to be staged regularly throughout the English-speaking world. [PAR] Historical background  [PAR] Mongkut, King of Siam, was about 57 years old in 1861.  He had lived half his life as a Buddhist monk and was an able scholar, founding a new order of Buddhism and a temple in Bangkok (paid for by his half-brother, King Nangklao). Through his decades of devotion, Mongkut acquired an ascetic lifestyle and a firm grasp of Western languages. When Nangklao died in 1850, Mongkut became king.  At that time, various European countries were striving for dominance, and American traders sought greater influence, in Southeast Asia.  He ultimately succeeded in keeping Siam an independent nation, partly by familiarizing his heirs and harem with Western ways.  [PAR] In 1861, Mongkut wrote to his Singapore agent, Tan Kim Ching, asking him to find a British lady to be governess to the royal children.  At the time, the British community in Singapore was small, and the choice fell on a recent arrival there, Anna Leonowens (1831\u20131915), who was running a small nursery school  in the colony.Morgan, pp. 86\u201387  Leonowens was the Anglo-Indian daughter of an Indian Army soldier and the widow of Thomas Owens, a clerk and hotel keeper. She had arrived in Singapore two years previously, claiming to be the genteel widow of an officer and explaining her dark complexion by stating that she was Welsh by birth.  Her deception was not detected until long after her death, and had still not come to light when The King and I was written.

During the flight, the 27-year-old test pilot and industrial technician also became the first man to orbit the planet, a feat accomplished by his space capsule in 89 minutes. Vostok 1 orbited Earth at a maximum altitude of 187 miles and was guided entirely by an automatic control system. The only statement attributed to Gagarin during his one hour and 48 minutes in space was, \u201cFlight is proceeding normally; I am well.\u201d [PAR] After his historic feat was announced, the attractive and unassuming Gagarin became an instant worldwide celebrity. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and given the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Monuments were raised to him across the Soviet Union and streets renamed in his honor. [PAR] The triumph of the Soviet space program in putting the first man into space was a great blow to the United States, which had scheduled its first space flight for May 1961. Moreover, Gagarin had orbited Earth, a feat that eluded the U.S. space program until February 1962, when astronaut John Glenn made three orbits in Friendship 7. By that time, the Soviet Union had already made another leap ahead in the \u201cspace race\u201d with the August 1961 flight of cosmonaut Gherman Titov in Vostok 2. Titov made 17 orbits and spent more than 25 hours in space. [PAR] To Soviet propagandists, the Soviet conquest of space was evidence of the supremacy of communism over capitalism. However, to those who worked on the Vostok program and earlier on Sputnik (which launched the first satellite into space in 1957), the successes were attributable chiefly to the brilliance of one man: Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Because of his controversial past, Chief Designer Korolev was unknown in the West and to all but insiders in the USSR until his death in 1966. [PAR] Born in the Ukraine in 1906, Korolev was part of a scientific team that launched the first Soviet liquid-fueled rocket in 1933. In 1938, his military sponsor fell prey to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges, and Korolev and his colleagues were also put on trial. Convicted of treason and sabotage, Korolev was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. The Soviet authorities came to fear German rocket advances, however, and after only a year Korolev was put in charge of a prison design bureau and ordered to continue his rocketry work. [PAR] In 1945, Korolev was sent to Germany to learn about the V-2 rocket, which had been used to devastating effect by the Nazis against the British. The Americans had captured the rocket\u2019s designer, Wernher von Braun, who later became head of the U.S. space program, but the Soviets acquired a fair amount of V-2 resources, including rockets, launch facilities, blueprints, and a few German V-2 technicians. By employing this technology and his own considerable engineering talents, by 1954 Korolev had built a rocket that could carry a five-ton nuclear warhead and in 1957 launched the first intercontinental ballistic missile. [PAR] That year, Korolev\u2019s plan to launch a satellite into space was approved, and on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 was fired into Earth\u2019s orbit. It was the first Soviet victory of the space race, and Korolev, still technically a prisoner, was officially rehabilitated. The Soviet space program under Korolev would go on to numerous space firsts in the late 1950s and early \u201960s: first animal in orbit, first large scientific satellite, first man, first woman, first three men, first space walk, first spacecraft to impact the moon, first to orbit the moon, first to impact Venus, and first craft to soft-land on the moon. Throughout this time, Korolev remained anonymous, known only as the \u201cChief Designer.\u201d His dream of sending cosmonauts to the moon eventually ended in failure, primarily because the Soviet lunar program received just one-tenth the funding allocated to America\u2019s successful Apollo lunar landing",

Please visit our online store and go shopping at the number one imported food delivery service in the USA. England has a rich cheese making history. English cheese is known for its slow aged, intense flavors made from traditional recipes handed down through the generations.  While cheese has been produced in England for thousands of years, today England produces hundreds of varieties of cheeses.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar and Blue Stilton, England's first and second most famous cheeses, have both been given PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status which establishes traditional methods for its production.  English PDO Cheeses must be made with local ingredients within certain geographical locations related to the specific cheese.  PDO protection helps ensure that an English Cheese like Farmhouse Cheddar or Blue Stilton does not stray from original recipes and continues England's time tested cheesemaking traditions. England continues to create new and unique cheese blends such as Cotswold (Double Gloucester with Onions and Chives) and the best-selling English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions. [PAR] Types of English Cheese: [PAR] Cheddar: Cheddar cheese originated the 1100s, perhaps earlier, in the village of Cheddar in southwestern England near the geological feature called Cheddar Gorge. Cheddar Gorge is a series of caves that naturally maintain the ideal conditions (humidity, temperature, etc.) for cheese ripening. In the 1800s, Joseph Harding, known as the modern father of Cheddar Cheese, revolutionized the cheddar cheese making process with advanced technology.  He is responsible for launching the Cheddar cheese making industries of Scotland, Canada, America and Australia.  Today this most famous English Cheese is made throughout the world, but especially in past members of the British Empire.  Cheddar is naturally white or pale yellow in color, the yellow coming from naturally occuring carotene in grass eaten by dairy cows. Darker yellow to orange varieties are produced using a natural food colorant called annatto.  Almost synonymous today with the phrase English Cheese, Cheddar develops a stronger, sharper taste the longer it ages.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar has been given PDO (name protection) status from the EU, requiring that it be produced from the milk within Devon, Dorset, Cornwall or Somerset, England. [PAR] Cheshire: Cheshire is considered to be the original English Cheese. It is firm and crumbly in texture with a mild, slightly salty flavor.  This white, or more typically yellow-orange cheese, again colored by annatto, is great crumbled over salads. It is also delicious with fruit or as a dessert cheese. [PAR] Lancashire: Lancashire is another ancient English Cheese whose history dates back to the 1200s.  It is traditionally made in three varieties based on the cheese's maturity: Creamy, Tasty or Crumbly.  Creamy Lancashire is matured between 4 and 12 weeks, while Tasty is matured from 12 weeks to 24 months.  Crumbly Lancashire was first produced in the 1960s and is usually eaten at 6 to 8 weeks in age.  Crumbly Lancashire is mild and fresh-tasting with a firm, dry and crumbly texture. We sometimes think of it as England's answer to Feta. [PAR] Blue Stilton: Known as the \"The King Of English Cheeses,\" Blue Stilton is a blue-mold English Cheese with a rich and mellow flavor and a smooth and creamy consistency.  Blue Stilton is recognized by its striking blue-green veins, naturally crinkly rind (inedible), complex flavor and crumbly texture. While Blue Stilton is milder than other famous blues of the world like Roquefort and Gorgonzola, it is excellent for crumbling over salads or as a dessert cheese, famously served with a Port Wine. This traditional English Cheese has been awarded PDO status, which maintains that it can only be made in the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire or Leicestershire from locally produced pasteurized milk. [PAR] White Stilton: White Stilton is produced in the same manner as Blue Stilton, without blue mold added to the milk.  The result is a fresh,",

EastEnders storylines examine the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in the fictional London Borough of Walford in the East End of London. The series primarily centres on the residents of Albert Square, a Victorian square of terraced houses, and its neighbouring streets, namely Bridge Street, Turpin Road and George Street. The area encompasses a pub, street market, night club, community centre, funeral parlour, caf\u00e9, wine bar, various other small businesses, a park and allotments. [PAR] The series was initially screened as two half-hour instalments per week. Since 2001, episodes are broadcast each weekday, apart from Wednesday, on BBC One. A same-day repeat was shown on BBC Three, from 2004 until 15 February 2016, after which W took over the showing. An omnibus edition was broadcast on a Sunday, from 1985 until its discontinuation, in 2015, but, as with the repeat screening, this was picked up by W in 2016. [PAR] It is one of the UK's highest-rated programmes, often appearing near or at the top of the week's BARB ratings. Within eight months of its launch, it reached the number-one spot in the ratings, and has consistently remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.  Created by producer Julia Smith and script editor Tony Holland, EastEnders has remained a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many controversial and taboo issues in British culture and social life previously unseen on United Kingdom mainstream television.  [PAR] , EastEnders has won nine BAFTA Awards and the Inside Soap Award for Best Soap for 14 years running (from 1997 to 2012),  as well as twelve National Television Awards for Most Popular Serial Drama  and 11 awards for Best Soap at the British Soap Awards.

As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. [PAR] Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College. His first of many books, The Naval War of 1812 (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the American West and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders, where he gained national fame for courage during the Spanish\u2013American War. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president as McKinley's running mate in the election of 1900. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley's re-election in a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism. [PAR] Following the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, succeeded to the office, becoming the youngest United States President in history. Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era, he championed his \"Square Deal\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Making conservation a top priority, he established a myriad of new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. [PAR] Elected in 1904 to a full term, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, William Howard Taft, to succeed him in the presidency. After leaving office, Roosevelt went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor. He tried but failed to win the presidential nomination in 1912. Roosevelt founded his own party, the Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split among Republicans enabled the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in 1912. The Democrats in the South had also gained power by having disenfranchised most blacks (and Republicans) from the political system from 1890 to 1908, fatally weakening the Republican Party across the region, and creating a Solid South dominated by their party alone. Republicans aligned with Taft nationally would control the Republican Party for decades. [PAR] Frustrated at home, Roosevelt led a two-year expedition in the Amazon Basin, nearly dying of tropical disease. During World War I, he opposed President Woodrow Wilson for keeping the U.S. out of the war against Germany, and offered his military services, which were never summoned. Although planning to run again for president in 1920, Roosevelt suffered deteriorating health and died in early 1919.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is an English Christmas carol that enumerates in the manner of a cumulative song a series of increasingly grand gifts given on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days after Christmas). The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin. \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68. The tunes of collected versions vary. The standard tune now associated with it is derived from a 1909 arrangement of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin, who first introduced the now familiar prolongation of the verse \"five gold rings\". [PAR] Lyrics  [PAR] \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses. There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by \"my true love\" on one of the twelve days of Christmas. [PAR] There are many variations in the lyrics. The lyrics given here are from Austin's 1909 publication that first established the current form of the carol.   The first three verses run, in full, as follows: [PAR] Subsequent verses follow the same pattern, each adding one new gift and repeating all the earlier gifts, so that each verse is one line longer than its predecessor: [PAR] 4 Calling Birds  [PAR] 5 Gold Rings  [PAR] 6 Geese a-Laying [PAR] 7 Swans a-Swimming [PAR] 8 Maids a-Milking [PAR] 9 Ladies Dancing [PAR] 10 Lords a-Leaping [PAR] 11 Pipers Piping [PAR] 12 Drummers Drumming [PAR] Variations of the lyrics  [PAR] The earliest known version of the lyrics was published under the title \"The Twelve Days of Christmas sung at King Pepin's Ball\", as part of a 1780 children's book, Mirth without Mischief.  Subsequent versions have shown considerable variation: [PAR] * In the earliest versions, the word \"On\" is not present at the beginning of each verse\u2014for example, the first verse begins simply \"The first day of Christmas\".  \"On\" was added in Austin's 1909 version, and became very popular thereafter. [PAR] * In the early versions \"my true love sent\" me the gifts. However, a 20th-century variant has \"my true love gave to me\"; this wording has become particularly common in North America.  [PAR] * The 1780 version has \"four colly birds\"\u2014\"colly\" being a regional English expression for \"black\".   This wording must have been opaque to many even in the 19th century: \"canary birds\", \"colour'd birds\", \"curley birds\", and \"corley birds\" are found in its place.  Frederic Austin's 1909 version, which introduced the now-standard melody, also altered the fourth day's gift to four \"calling\" birds, and this variant has become the most popular, although \"colly\" is still found. [PAR] * The \"five gold rings\" may become \"five golden rings\", especially in North America. In the standard melody, this change enables singers to fit one syllable per musical note.  [PAR] * The gifts associated with the final four days are often reordered.  For example, the pipers may be on the ninth day rather than the eleventh. Annotations reprinted from 4000 Years of Christmas by Earl W. Count (New York: Henry Schuman, 1948) [PAR] For ease of comparison with Austin's 1909 version given above: [PAR] (a) differences in wording, ignoring capitalisation and punctuation, are indicated in italics; [PAR] (b) items that do not appear at all in Austin's version are indicated in bold italics. [PAR] Scotland  [PAR] In Scotland, early in the 19th century, the recitation began: \"The king sent his lady on the first Yule day, | A popingo-aye [parrot]; | Wha learns my carol and carries it away?\" The succeeding gifts were two partridges, three plovers, a goose that was grey, three starlings, three goldspinks, a bull that was brown, three ducks a-merry laying",

[PAR] But while the goals and upsets have been occurring in the Football League for 125 years , the same cannot be said for the handing out of cards. [PAR] They made their debut in the English game in 1976, and the first player to receive a red one was Blackburn Rovers winger Dave Wagstaffe. [PAR] The former Wolves midfielder, who died this week aged 70, was given his marching orders in a Division Two match at Leyton Orient on 2 October. Later that afternoon a certain George Best also saw red playing for Fulham at Southampton in the same division. [PAR] But where did the idea for the cards come from? [PAR] Traffic lights [PAR] The cards were shown after the Football League voluntarily adopted a system introduced to the game in the 1970 World Cup. [PAR] David Barber, from the Football Association, said the idea is credited to English referee Ken Aston from Ilford, London. [PAR] Image caption Winger Dave Wagstaffe left Wolves in 1976 for Blackburn Rovers [PAR] Mr Barber said: \"He refereed the 1963 FA Cup Final and was in charge of the referees at the '66 World Cup, during which there was confusion over [Argentina's] Antonio Rattin's dismissal against England. [PAR] \"Had he actually been sent off?\" [PAR] The player had indeed been given his marching orders, for reasons that were about as unclear as the indication of the dismissal itself. [PAR] Mr Aston had to help persuade Argentina's captain to leave the field of play. [PAR] It was while the referee was driving along Kensington High Street that he had the idea of introducing yellow and red cards in a bid to overcome language barriers and give a clear indication to players and supporters alike. [PAR] He was stopped at traffic lights when it dawned on him that yellow could be for a caution, a warning to a player to take it easy. And red would simply mean stop - your game is over. [PAR] The card system was trialled at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and they were introduced into European club games at some point afterwards. [PAR] Football violence [PAR] Some six years later they made their way into the English game where they were used in the domestic game for less than five years initially. [PAR] Tony Brown, from SoccerData, explained why two red cards were shown on the day they were introduced. [PAR] \"Wagstaffe was the first to receive a red, for arguing with the ref [after 36 mins],\" Mr Brown said. [PAR] \"George Best received a red for foul language in the 67th minute.\" [PAR] Image caption The inspiration for the cards came from colours of the traffic light [PAR] He added: \"In 1980, there was concern over violence on and off the pitch. [PAR] \"The FA, not the League, thought that 'demonstrative referees' were part of the problem, and decided to do away with red cards.\" [PAR] The decision was ratified by the FA Council in January 1981 and two of the last red cards, for the time being, were shown to David Hodgson and Nicky Reid in a game between Manchester City and Middlesbrough. [PAR] But Mr Brown said that by 1987 \"the International Board, the rule-making body of the international game, said that England was out of step and should reintroduce cards for the 1987-88 season\". [PAR] Luton Town forward Mick Harford had the dubious honour of being shown the first red card in a league match following their reintroduction. The Hatter walked just four minutes into the opening day defeat at Derby County in Division One on 15 August 1987.

[PAR] The Football League, also known as the npower Football League for sponsorship reasons, is a league competition featuring professional association football clubs from England and Wales. [PAR] Founded in 1888, it is the oldest such competition in world football. It was the top level football league in England from its foundation until 1992. [PAR] Since 1995 it has had 72 clubs evenly divided into three divisions, which are currently known as The Championship, League One and League Two. Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest placed clubs in the Premier League. [PAR] A director of Aston Villa, William McGregor, was the first to set out to bring some order to a chaotic world where clubs arranged their own fixtures. On March 2, 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. [PAR] The first meeting was held at Anderson's Hotel in London on March 23, 1888, on the eve of the FA Cup Final. The Football League was formally created and named in Manchester at a further meeting on April 17 at the Royal Hotel. [PAR] In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League to take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal and on May 27, 1992, the Premier League as we know it today was formed. [PAR] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. [PAR] There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions. [PAR] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon. [PAR] A total of 43 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992 until the end of the 2009/10 season. Two other clubs (Luton Town and Notts County) were signatories to the original agreement that created the Premier League, but were relegated prior to the inaugural Premier League season and have not subsequently returned to the top flight. [PAR] Seven clubs have been members of the Premier League for every season since its inception. This group is composed of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur. [PAR] Due to insistence by Fifa that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] St Trinian's SchoolSt Trinian's was a British gag cartoon comic strip series, created and drawn by Ronald Searle from 1946 until 1952.  The cartoons all centre on a boarding school for girls, where the teachers are sadists and the girls are juvenile delinquents. The series was Searle's most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films that has outlived the short-running cartoon series. [PAR] Concept [PAR] The first cartoon appeared in 1941, but shortly afterwards Searle had to fulfil his military service. He was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 he started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was a lot darker in comparison with the previous years. [PAR] The school is the antithesis of the type of posh girls' boarding school depicted by Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil; its female pupils are bad and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the uniform of the school that Searle's daughter Kate attended, JAGS in Dulwich. The films implied that the girls were the daughters of gangsters, crooks, shady bookmakers, and other low-lifes and the institution is often referred to as a \"female borstal\". [PAR] The inspiration [PAR] During 1941 Searle had left for the artist's community in the village of Kirkcudbright in Edinburgh and it was whilst visiting the family Johnston there that he made a drawing to please their two schoolgirl daughters, C\u00e9cil\u00e9 and Pat, (their school had been evacuated to New Gala House in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders owing to the war), and Searle was puzzled as to why two schoolgirls should seem so keen to return to their school, an Academy for Young Ladies in Dalkeith Road \u2014 the name of their school was St Trinnean's.   [PAR] Searle's St. Trinian's was based on two independent girls' schools in Cambridge\u2014Perse School for Girls, now known as the co-educational Stephen Perse Foundation, and St Mary's School. Searle, growing up in Cambridge, saw the girls on their way to and from school on a regular basis and they were the original inspiration for the cartoons and the character. Testaments to this fact can be found in the Perse School for Girls' Archive area where there are several original  St Trinian's books, given to the school by Ronald Searle. He also based the school partly on the former Cambridgeshire High School for Girls (now Long Road Sixth Form College).

B. Wyndham-Lewis) [PAR] * Souls in Torment (1953) [PAR] Films [PAR] In the 1950s, a series of St Trinians comedy films was made featuring well-known British actors including Alastair Sim (in drag as the headmistress, but also playing her brother), George Cole as spiv \"Flash Harry\", Joyce Grenfell as Sgt Ruby Gates, a beleaguered policewoman, and Richard Wattis and Eric Barker as the civil servants at the Ministry of Education for whom the school is a source of constant frustration and nervous breakdowns.  Searle's cartoons appeared in the films' main title design. [PAR] In the films the school became embroiled in various shady enterprises, thanks mainly to Flash, and, as a result, was always threatened with closure by the Ministry.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Tower BridgeTower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built in 1886\u20131894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets. [PAR] The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. [PAR] The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway. The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge. [PAR] History [PAR] Inception [PAR] In the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the East End of London led to a requirement for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London. [PAR] A Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect (who was also one of the judges),  was approved. [PAR] Jones' engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry, devised the idea of a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. [PAR] Construction [PAR] Construction started in 1887 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.  \u2013 and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. [PAR] Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] National anthemA national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is a generally patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  [PAR] Languages [PAR] A national anthem is usually in the national or most common language of the country, whether de facto or official, there are notable exceptions. Most commonly, states with more than one national language may offer several versions of their anthem, for instance: [PAR] *The Swiss Psalm, the national anthem of Switzerland, has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages (French, German, Italian and Romansh). [PAR] *The anthem of Canada, O Canada, has official lyrics in both English and French, and is frequently sung with a mixture of stanzas in both languages, representing the country's bilingual nature. [PAR] *Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann, the anthem of the Republic of Ireland, was written in English, but an Irish translation, although never formally adopted, is now almost always sung. [PAR] *The current national anthem of South Africa is unique in that five of the country's eleven official languages are used in the same anthem (the first stanza is divided between two languages, with each of the remaining three stanzas in a different language). [PAR] *One of the two official national anthems of New Zealand, God Defend New Zealand, is now traditionally sung with the first verse in M\u0101ori (Aotearoa) and the second in English (God Defend New Zealand). The tune is the same but the words are not a direct translation of each other. Similarly, God Bless Fiji has lyrics in English and Fijian which are not translations of each other. [PAR] *There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their anthems. One of these is the Marcha Real, the anthem of Spain. In 2007 a national competition to write words was held, but no lyrics were chosen.  Other anthems with no words include Inno Nazionale della Repubblica, the anthem of San Marino, and that of Kosovo, entitled Europe. [PAR] *The national anthem of India, \"Jana Gana Mana\", has lyrics in the Bengali language, although their official language is Hindi and English. [PAR] History [PAR] National anthems rose to prominence in Europe during the 19th century, but some originated much earlier. The oldest national anthem belongs to the Netherlands and is called the Wilhelmus. It was written between 1568 and 1572 during the Dutch Revolt, but did not become the official anthem until 1932. [PAR] The Japanese anthem, Kimigayo, has the oldest lyrics, which were taken from a Heian period (794\u20131185) poem, yet it was not set to music until 1880.  [PAR] In contrast, the music of Qaumi Taranah, Pakistan's national anthem was composed in 1949, preceding its lyrics, which were written in 1952.   [PAR] The Philippine anthem Lupang Hinirang was composed in 1898 as wordless incidental music for the ceremony declaring independence from the Spanish Empire. The Spanish poem Filipinas was written the following year to serve as the anthem's lyrics; the current Tagalog version dates to 1962. [PAR] God Save the Queen, the national anthem of the United Kingdom and the royal anthem reserved for use in the presence of the Monarch in some Commonwealth Realms, was first performed in 1745 under the title God Save the King. [PAR] Spain's national anthem, the Marcha Real (The Royal March), written in 1761, was among the first to be adopted as such, in 1770. Denmark adopted the older of its two national anthems, Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast, in 1780; and La Marseillaise, the French anthem, was written in 1792 and adopted in 1795.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Captain George Mainwaring - Dad's Army Wiki - WikiaCaptain George Mainwaring | Dad's Army Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia [PAR] Edit [PAR] George Mainwaring was born in 1885. He is a pompous, blustering figure with overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager, and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He believes in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. He is class conscious and a snob, considering himself upper-middle class and looking down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. His pretensions stand in contrast to Wilson , who is genuinely Upper Middle Class, Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's having attending public school, believing it made him 'wet', while his own state-school background is an attribute. Mainwaring and Wilson's relationship is mainly based on the fact that Mainwaring has always had to struggle and fight for everything in his life, whereas Wilson has just sat back and let it all come to him, (despite being a strong autocrat, Mainwaring fully believes that people should work and earn everything they get in life). Mainwaring is prudish and repressed, and can be judgemental about people who do not share his moral outlook. [PAR] Mainwaring [PAR] Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those he considers beneath him, and his arrogance is frequently punctured by circumstance and the people around him, such as Arthur Wilson , his chief clerk with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship, and Private Walker , a black-marketeer who interjects during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefitting from underhanded deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not, and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. [PAR] As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he is barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, and his plans result in chaos. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain of World War I. (In World War II, John Le Mesurier who played Wilson, had been a Captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major). He did, however, serve in the army of occupation in France, \"during the whole of 1919 \u2014 somebody had to clear up the mess.\" (He tried to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight; Arthur Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to World War II but was also rejected with poor eyesight.) [PAR] Despite his shortcomings as a leader, Mainwaring considers himself an excellent military tactician. His height and background is frequently demonstrated to show a Napoleon Complex; he is frequently referred to as 'Napoleon' by his nemesis Hodges . In one episode, A Soldier's Farewell , Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte , and is thwarted at the Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington looking like Wilson. His pomposity and conviction of his prowess see Mainwaring yearn to be in control of any situation, and he behaves in an arrogant manner; this is demonstrated by the first episode, in which he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience or qualifications (and had to wait until the episode Room at the Bottom before he received his commission). [PAR] In Command Decision he was prepared to relinquish control so the platoon could gain rifles, arguing defence of the country was more important than his ego. In addition he was prepared to \"march in the ranks as Private Mainwaring\" when he was briefly de-commissioned. This implied he was more overzealous than a control freak. [PAR] Mainwaring's patriotism can lead to xenophobia (he is not keen on the French because they are emotional, the Russians because their communism, and the Germans and the Italians because of them being such deadly enemies).

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Driest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile - Extreme ScienceDriest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Driest Place: Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Even the Driest Place on Earth has Water [PAR] These incredibly     dry mountains see an average of less than .004 inches/.01cm of     rain per year. Many times this area will go without rainfall at      all for years. Some places in the Atacama Desert have not      had rainfall for over 400 years.  The     Atacama desert is found along the coast of Chile, South America -      right next to the Pacific Ocean - the biggest body of water      in the world. Much of the desert extends up into the Andes mountains      and is very high in elevation. Unlike more familiar deserts, like     the Sahara desert in Africa and the Mojave in California, the Atacama      is actually a pretty cold place, with average daily temperatures ranging      between 0\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. The annual rainfall (or lack of it)      defines a desert, but that doesn't mean that it never rains in Atacama.     Every so often a warming effect over the Pacific Ocean around the      equator changes the weather the world over and even places like the      driest desert in the world can become doused with drenching storms.     Even though Atacama gets almost no rainfall, there is water in this      arid place and you'll find it in the following places: [PAR] Salt Lakes [PAR] During years     of heavy rainfall in the distant past, enough water accumulated in     basins found throughout the Andes to create lakes. Some of the lakes     got their water from melting glaciers at the end of the last ice age.      But in some lakes in the Andes mountains, such as Atacama, more water      is lost through evaporation than is replaced by rainfall so the lakes      are drying up. As the water evaporates, the mineral salts in the water      become more concentrated, creating very salty water. [PAR] Snow [PAR] In the higher          elevations when precipitation comes to Atacama snow falls instead          of rain. There are small patches of unmelted snow in the mountain          tops where in never gets warm enough to melt the snow. [PAR] Underground [PAR] Anywhere you      go in the world, regardless of how much or little it rains, there      is always water underground. After it rains, some of the rainwater      evaporates back into the air, but much of it trickles down into the      ground and stays there - even in the desert. How much water and where      depends on a number of things; soil composition, air and soil surface      temperature, amount and frequency of rainfall/precipitation, and drainage.      Since the Andes is a volcanically active mountain range, the magma      beneath the ground will heat the groundwater in certain places causing      geysers to erupt. [PAR] Fog and Dew [PAR] This mummy of a girl is from the Atacama Desert. Her remains are            estimated to be about 800 years old. Find out more about mummies. [PAR] Most of the precipitation that comes to the      Atacama is in the form of fog that blows in the from the Pacific.      Fog is essentially very low clouds, consisting of water vapor cooling      and beginning to condense. If you've ever been in fog you know that      it can leave you a little moist. When the air temperature reaches      dew point the water vapor in the air condenses to leave little droplets      of water behind. The few things that are able to survive in the Atacama live on the combined moisture from fog and dew. [PAR] Does Anything Live There? [PAR] Many people          have the view that deserts are places forsaken by Mother Nature and          that no living thing would possibly want to set up camp in a place so          dry. Although it is tough to find anything living in the Atacama there          are isolated pockets and small patches of plants, which support life          for animals and insects. Some plant species have adapted well to this          dry environment by developing tap roots that run very deep into the          ground gathering water from below. There are flocks of flamingos that          live in and around the salt",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Marilyn MonroeMarilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926\u00a0\u2013 August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult. Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928. The identity",

[PAR] Leonard Rossiter was born on October 21st, 1926 in Liverpool. Unable to afford to go to university, he worked in an insurance office until he was 27, when he joined Preston repertory company and made his professional stage debut in The Gay Dog. After Preston, he starred in productions at Wolverhampton, Salisbury and The Old Vic Company at Bristol's Theatre Royal. In 1962 he made his first big-screen appearance in A Kind of Loving, followed by other films throughout the 1960s, including Billy Liar, King Rat and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and TV appearances such as Z Cars, The Avengers and Steptoe and Son. His portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the 1969 play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui made him a West End star. His roles as Rigsby in Rising Damp and the title role in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin made him a household name, and his Cinzano commercials with Joan Collins were comic masterpieces. A keen sportsman, he excelled in squash, tennis and football. He was also a connoisseur of fine wines. His busy career came to a tragically premature end on October 5th 1984, just sixteen days short of his 58th birthday. During a performance of Joe Orton's play Loot, Leonard suffered a heart attack in his dressing room. He was married to actress Gillian Raine and had a daughter, Camilla. See Leonard Rossiter.com for a vastly-expanded biography and a complete, illustrated career guide.

One of them was Rising Damp...\" [PAR] - \"I recognised a lot of things Eric [Chappell] wrote, coming from the North - I come from Liverpool. Of being very jealous about the young people of today regarding sex and so on. That's very Rigsby, but I recognise it from when I grew up.\" [PAR] - \"Of course, the difficulty with comedy series, as I think most people realise, is that the first two are often quite good and then they begin to tail off afterwards. And I reckon that Eric was capable of writing at least six good scripts, so I did the first series without any qualms. The difficulty came afterwards in doing the second series, as to whether Eric could keep up the standard he had set himself, and I asked him before we did them if he would be able to write them, and he said \"I didn't know I could write the first six!\".\" [PAR] - \"I knew people like this [Rigsby]. I've sat in pubs with them.\" [PAR] - (On The Movie) \"I was approached and was delighted to play Rigsby again. It is the funniest character I have everplayed. Eric Chappell is a marvellous writer.

[PAR] Bureau of Reclamation [PAR] Grand  Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River west of Spokane, Washington, is one of the  largest structures ever built by mankind--a mass of concrete standing 550 feet  high and 5,223 feet long, or just shy of a mile. Grand Coulee contains 12 million cubic yards  of concrete, or enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami. More massive than the Great Pyramid of Giza, Grand  Coulee is listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven  civil engineering wonders of the United States. Grand Coulee's reservoir,  Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, stretches 150  miles north, almost to the Canadian border. [PAR] A concrete gravity dam, Grand Coulee took  eight years to build, employed thousands of men during the Great Depression and,  when completed in 1942, provided the enormous electrical power necessary to  make aluminum, so essential for World War II production of planes and ships. It was  Grand Coulee, as well, that powered the production of plutonium at the nearby  Hanford Site, which figured prominently in the making of the atomic bomb. [PAR] So  grand was Grand Coulee Dam that in 1941 folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote \u201cThe  Song of the Grand Coulee Dam\u201d (though he was paid to do so under contract with  the Bonneville Power Administration.) \u201cBiggest  thing built by the hand of a Man,\u201d Guthrie sang. \u201cPower that sings, boys, turbines that whine.  Waters back up the Canadian Line.\u201d [PAR] Appropriate  as the word grand is for the dam, the  name Grand Coulee actually refers to a  unique geological feature created thousands of years ago when Ice Age glaciers  blocked the ancient riverbed of the Columbia River. When water eventually traveled under the ice  dam, great floods scoured out hundreds of miles of deep gulches, or coulees, in  the Columbia River Basin. One of these, the Grand  Coulee, is four miles wide and bordered on three sides by steep cliffs. [PAR] A local  proposal to dam the Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee dated to 1918, but  the idea faced strong competition from another proposal that called for an  irrigation canal to be built from the Pend Oreille River in northern Idaho. Proponents of this latter \u201cgravity plan\u201d argued that the hydroelectricity generated from the dam was not needed. Many studies followed, including one by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which took Grand Coulee\u2019s side, recommending a high dam  at the site and the pumping of irrigation water up to the surrounding  countryside. [PAR] This recommendation took hold with the Bureau  of Reclamation, which was promoting construction of multiple-use dams, through  which the production of hydroelectric power could produce revenue to help repay the construction cost of a project. (The Reclamation Act requires that beneficiaries of a project repay those costs, and a multi-purpose project reduced the payment burden on irrigators.) The recommendation found  traction with the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in a  time of great dust bowls and economic depression. Roosevelt launched federal program after  federal program in an attempt to spur the economy by \u201cpriming the pump\u201d and  providing jobs for out-of-work Americans.

[PAR] How many books are in the Bible? [PAR] The Bible contains 66 books, divided among the Old and New Testaments. [PAR] How many books are in the Old Testament? [PAR] There are 39 books in the Old Testament. [PAR] How many books are in the New Testament? [PAR] There are 27 books in the New Testament. [PAR] What does \"testament\" mean? [PAR] Testament means \"covenant\" or \"contract.\" [PAR] Who wrote the Bible? [PAR] The Bible was written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit by over 40 different authors from all walks of life: shepherds, farmers, tent-makers, physicians, fishermen, priests, philosophers and kings. Despite these differences in occupation and the span of years it took to write it, the Bible is an extremely cohesive and unified book. [PAR] Which single author contributed the most books to the Old Testament? [PAR] Moses. He wrote the first five books of the Bible, referred to as the Pentateuch; the foundation of the Bible. [PAR] Which single author contributed the most books to the New Testament? [PAR] The Apostle Paul, who wrote 14 books (over half) of the New Testament. [PAR] When was the Bible written? [PAR] It was written over a period of some 1,500 years, from around 1450 B.C. (the time of Moses) to about 100 A.D. (following the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ). [PAR] What is the oldest book in the Old Testament? [PAR] Many scholars agree that Job is the oldest book in the Bible, written by an unknown Israelite about 1500 B.C. Others hold that the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible) are the oldest books in the Bible, written between 1446 and 1406 B.C. [PAR] What is the youngest book in the Old Testament? [PAR] The book of Malachi, written about 400 B.C. [PAR] What is the oldest book of the New Testament? [PAR] Probably the book of James, written as early as A.D. 45.

[PAR] The entire New Testament as we know it today, was canonized before the year 375 A.D. The Old Testament had previously been canonized long before the advent of Christ. [PAR] What does \"canon\" mean? [PAR] \"Canon\" is derived front the Greek word \"Kanon,\" signifying a measuring rod. Thus, to have the Bible \"canonized\" meant that it had been measured by the standard or test of divine inspiration and authority. It became the collection of books or writings accepted by the apostles and leadership of the early Christian church as a basis for Christian belief. It is the standard by which all Christians throughout the ages live and worship. [PAR] When was the first translation of the Bible made into English? [PAR] 1382 A.D., by John Wycliffe. [PAR] When was the Bible printed? [PAR] The Bible was printed in 1454 A.D. by Johannes Gutenberg who invented the \"type mold\" for the printing press. It was the first book ever printed. [PAR] What is the oldest almost-complete manuscript of the Bible now in existence? [PAR] The Codex Vaticanus, which dates from the first half of the fourth Century.

For example, \u2018aleph\u2019 means \u2018ox\u2019, \u2018bet\u2019 means \u2018house\u2019 and \u2018gimmel\u2019 means \u2018throw stick\u2019.3 Early Greek letters are very similar and sometimes identical to the West Semitic letters.4 The letter sequence between the Semitic and Greek alphabets is identical. (Naveh 1982)\" and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. [PAR] In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era. [PAR] Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the 5th century BC and today. Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics. The traditional orthography, which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek, has many diacritics, such as accent marks for pitch accent (\"polytonic\"), the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial sound, and the iota subscript for the final historical sound. In standard Modern Greek spelling, orthography has been simplified to the monotonic system, which uses only two diacritics: the acute accent and diaeresis. [PAR] Letters  [PAR] Sound values  [PAR] In both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable. Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic. For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages.  [PAR] Among consonant letters, all letters that denoted voiced plosive consonants (/b, d, g/) and aspirated plosives (/p\u02b0, t\u02b0, k\u02b0/) in Ancient Greek stand for corresponding fricative sounds in Modern Greek. The correspondences are as follows: [PAR] Among the vowel symbols, Modern Greek sound values reflect the radical simplification of the vowel system of post-classical Greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into a much smaller number. This leads to several groups of vowel letters denoting identical sounds today. Modern Greek orthography remains true to the historical spellings in most of these cases. As a consequence, the spellings of words in Modern Greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable. [PAR] The following vowel letters and digraphs are involved in the mergers: [PAR] Modern Greek speakers typically use the same, modern, sound-symbol mappings in reading Greek of all historical stages. In other countries, students of Ancient Greek may use a variety of conventional approximations of the historical sound system in pronouncing Ancient Greek. [PAR] Digraphs and letter combinations  [PAR] Several letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components. Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized",

Known as the First Battle of Bull Run (or Manassas), the engagement began when about 35,000 Union troops marched from the federal capital in Washington, D.C. to strike a Confederate force of 20,000 along a small river known as Bull Run. After fighting on the defensive for most of the day, the rebels rallied and were able to break the Union right flank, sending the Federals into a chaotic retreat towards Washington. The Confederate victory gave the South a surge of confidence and shocked many in the North, who realized the war would not be won as easily as they had hoped. [PAR] Google [PAR] Prelude to the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) [PAR] By July 1861, two months after Confederate troops opened fire on Fort Sumter to begin the Civil War, the northern press and public were eager for the Union Army to make an advance on Richmond ahead of the planned meeting of the Confederate Congress there on July 20. Encouraged by early victories by Union troops in western Virginia , and by the war fever spreading through the North, President Abraham Lincoln ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to mount an offensive that would hit quickly and decisively at the enemy and open the way to Richmond, thus bringing the war to a mercifully quick end. The offensive would begin with an attack on more than 20,000 Confederate troops under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction, Virginia (25 miles from Washington , D.C.) along a little river known as Bull Run. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] After First Manassas, Stonewall Jackson further distinguished himself in the Shenandoah Valley, Second Manassas and Fredericksburg. The man Lee called his \"right arm\" was accidentally shot by his own men at Chancellorsville and died of complications relating to the injury. [PAR] The cautious McDowell, then in command of the 35,000 Union volunteer troops gathered in the Federal capital, knew that his men were ill prepared and pushed for a postponement of the advance to give him time for additional training. But Lincoln ordered him to begin the offensive nonetheless, reasoning (correctly) that the rebel army was made up of similarly amateur soldiers. McDowell\u2019s army began moving out of Washington on July 16; its slow movement allowed Beauregard (who also received advance notice of his enemy\u2019s movements through a Confederate espionage network in Washington) to call on his fellow Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for reinforcements. Johnston, in command of some 11,000 rebels in the Shenandoah Valley, was able to outmaneuver a Union force in the region and march his men towards Manassas. [PAR] Battle Begins at Bull Run [PAR] McDowell\u2019s Union force struck on July 21, shelling the enemy across Bull Run while more troops crossed the river at Sudley Ford in an attempt to hit the Confederate left flank. Over two hours, 10,000 Federals gradually pushed back 4,500 rebels across the Warrington turnpike and up Henry House Hill. Reporters, congressmen and other onlookers who had traveled from Washington and were watching the battle from the nearby countryside prematurely celebrated a Union victory, but reinforcements from both Johnston and Beauregard\u2019s armies soon arrived on the battlefield to rally the Confederate troops. In the afternoon, both sides traded attacks and counterattacks near Henry House Hill. On Johnston and Beauregard\u2019s orders, more and more Confederate reinforcements arrived, even as the Federals struggled with coordinating assaults made by different regiments. [PAR] The \u201cRebel Yell\u201d at Bull Run (Manassas) [PAR] By four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, both sides had an equal number of men on the field of battle (about 18,000 on each side were engaged at Bull Run), and Beauregard ordered a counterattack along the entire line. Screaming as they advanced (the \u201crebel yell\u201d that would become infamous among Union troops) the Confederates managed to break the Union line.

[PAR] Bureau of Reclamation [PAR] Grand  Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River west of Spokane, Washington, is one of the  largest structures ever built by mankind--a mass of concrete standing 550 feet  high and 5,223 feet long, or just shy of a mile. Grand Coulee contains 12 million cubic yards  of concrete, or enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami. More massive than the Great Pyramid of Giza, Grand  Coulee is listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven  civil engineering wonders of the United States. Grand Coulee's reservoir,  Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, stretches 150  miles north, almost to the Canadian border. [PAR] A concrete gravity dam, Grand Coulee took  eight years to build, employed thousands of men during the Great Depression and,  when completed in 1942, provided the enormous electrical power necessary to  make aluminum, so essential for World War II production of planes and ships. It was  Grand Coulee, as well, that powered the production of plutonium at the nearby  Hanford Site, which figured prominently in the making of the atomic bomb. [PAR] So  grand was Grand Coulee Dam that in 1941 folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote \u201cThe  Song of the Grand Coulee Dam\u201d (though he was paid to do so under contract with  the Bonneville Power Administration.) \u201cBiggest  thing built by the hand of a Man,\u201d Guthrie sang. \u201cPower that sings, boys, turbines that whine.  Waters back up the Canadian Line.\u201d [PAR] Appropriate  as the word grand is for the dam, the  name Grand Coulee actually refers to a  unique geological feature created thousands of years ago when Ice Age glaciers  blocked the ancient riverbed of the Columbia River. When water eventually traveled under the ice  dam, great floods scoured out hundreds of miles of deep gulches, or coulees, in  the Columbia River Basin. One of these, the Grand  Coulee, is four miles wide and bordered on three sides by steep cliffs. [PAR] A local  proposal to dam the Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee dated to 1918, but  the idea faced strong competition from another proposal that called for an  irrigation canal to be built from the Pend Oreille River in northern Idaho. Proponents of this latter \u201cgravity plan\u201d argued that the hydroelectricity generated from the dam was not needed. Many studies followed, including one by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which took Grand Coulee\u2019s side, recommending a high dam  at the site and the pumping of irrigation water up to the surrounding  countryside. [PAR] This recommendation took hold with the Bureau  of Reclamation, which was promoting construction of multiple-use dams, through  which the production of hydroelectric power could produce revenue to help repay the construction cost of a project. (The Reclamation Act requires that beneficiaries of a project repay those costs, and a multi-purpose project reduced the payment burden on irrigators.) The recommendation found  traction with the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in a  time of great dust bowls and economic depression. Roosevelt launched federal program after  federal program in an attempt to spur the economy by \u201cpriming the pump\u201d and  providing jobs for out-of-work Americans.  Unprecedented funds flowed to the Bureau of Reclamation as it became a  key player in the New Deal\u2019s Public Works Administration (PWA), which spent \u201cbig bucks on big projects,\u201d Grand Coulee Dam among them.

Dickens and his illustrator Hablot Browne        (phiz) traveled incognito to Yorkshire on a fact-finding mission in        January 1838. There they encountered William Shaw, headmaster of Bowes Academy,        in whose school several boys had died or went blind from mistreatment and        neglect. [PAR] Visiting a cemetery in the area Dickens found the graves of many of the        students of these schools and one in particular Dickens said \"put Smike        into my head\". Smike was the abused inmate of Dotheboys Hall, the fictional        school he based on Shaw's Bowes Academy in Nicholas Nickleby. The        fictional headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, Wackford Squeers, was based on William        Shaw. [PAR] The ignorance of the schoolmaster Squeers is more than a comic exaggeration.

In the preface to the Cheap Edition              of Nicholas Nickleby in 1848 Dickens claimed that the brothers              were based on real persons \"with whom I never interchanged any communication              in my life\".

The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.\u00a0 Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.\u00a0 The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.\u00a0 The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley\" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.\u00a0 He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real.

[PAR] One important point to note: These 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type \u2013 are not to be confused with each other. [PAR] The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that our voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas the Type of Voice refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to understand more about how to find your own vocal range, as well as how to determine your own voice type using the various criteria! [PAR] Now, the 4 main types of male voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Countertenor [PAR] Let us look at each of these male voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. COUNTERTENOR [PAR] The Countertenor Voice may actually be unfamiliar to those of us not from the classical realm, as many of us would probably only have heard of the 3 main male voices \u2013 Tenor, Baritone and Bass. [PAR] The Countertenor voice is the highest of the adult male voice types, and has a vocal range that is similar to that of the Female Contralto Voice, the lowest of the female voice types! In the Mandarin pop scene, certain singers like Jeff Chang and the lead singer of popular pop rock band Soda Green would probably qualify as countertenor voices! [PAR] An approximate Countertenor Vocal Range would be from a G note below the middle C (G3) to a high F one octave above the middle C (F5). Be sure to support your voice well with your breath so as to get a more accurate representation of the range in your voice. Check out the section on \u2018How to Find Your Singing Range and Voice Type\u2019 to get some tips on finding your range on your own! [PAR] Also, the Tessitura or most comfortable singing range for Countertenors lies above that of the Tenor and other adult male voices. The Countertenor voice would usually be able to sing the high head voice notes with great ease and brightness in tone, and would often be confused by many listeners with regular female voices. [PAR] 2. TENOR [PAR] The Tenor Voice is the highest of the main male vocal types that most people would be familiar with, with the typical tenor vocal range lying between the C note one octave below middle C (C3) to the C note one octave above middle C (C5)! This means that it would lie just slightly below the Countertenor voice, but has similar characteristics in the sense that the Tenor would also be able to sing most high notes with ease and vocalize the head voice notes with strength and brightness! [PAR] The Tenor voice would probably transition into his middle voice around the D or E note above middle C (D4 or E4) and shift into head voice around the F sharp or G above middle C (F4 or G4). The tenor tessitura would lie between that of the Countertenor\u2019s and the Baritone\u2019s. Do make sure that we avoid certain common singing problems like jaw tightness when we attempt to find out where our vocal register transitions lie, as this will affect the notes at which we transition, affecting the voice type we may classify ourselves to be! [PAR] Famous Tenor voices include the 3 Tenors \u2013 Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as well as other classical singers like Enrico Caruso and pop singers like Elton John, Stevie Wonder. In the Mandarin pop scene, JJ Lin Junjie and Jay Chou would probably be considered Tenor voices too! [PAR] 3. BARITONE [PAR] Most men would have a vocal range similar to that of a Baritone voice, as this is the most common of the male voice types!

At one time, Brooklyn County was not a borough of New York City , and actually functioned as a traditional county among others in New York. It contained the city of Brooklyn, as well as many other towns and cities, each of which had their own forms of government. In 1898, a new state charter was drawn up to consolidate the cities and towns of the New York metropolitan area into cohesive boroughs. This resulted in the formation of modern-day Brooklyn.

It requires the respondent to understand the legal and administrative changes that occurred, and to reflect on how these changes have shaped the borough's current position as a major urban center with significant population and economic impact.\nCorrect Answer: The consolidation of Brooklyn into the modern borough of New York City in 1898 reduced its status as a standalone county, but it increased its significance as a major urban center within the consolidated city. This consolidation resulted in a larger, more interconnected city with a combined population of over 2.5 million people, making Brooklyn the fourth-largest city in the United States if it were to exist as an independent entity. The current administrative and demographic status reflects the enduring importance of Brooklyn in the broader New York City area.\n</output_format>",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] New ZealandNew Zealand () is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses \u2013 that of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu \u2013 and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. [PAR] Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand, and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture. In 1642, Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, became the first European to sight New Zealand.  In 1840, representatives of the British Crown and M\u0101ori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, making New Zealand a British colony. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.7 million is of European descent; the indigenous M\u0101ori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from M\u0101ori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant. [PAR] New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy. New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom and quality of life. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently John Key. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt, supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America.  In 1645, Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland.   British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand. [PAR] Aotearoa (often translated as \"land of the long white cloud\") is the current M\u0101ori name for New Zealand. It is unknown whether M\u0101ori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans, with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island. M\u0101ori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui (the fish of M\u0101ui) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) or Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki) for the South Island. Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle (South Island) and South (Stewart Island / Rakiura).  In 1830, maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907, this was the accepted norm.  The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013.  This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Theodore RooseveltTheodore  Roosevelt Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858 \u2013 January 6, 1919) was an American statesman, author, explorer, soldier, naturalist, and reformer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. [PAR] Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College. His first of many books, The Naval War of 1812 (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the American West and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders, where he gained national fame for courage during the Spanish\u2013American War. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president as McKinley's running mate in the election of 1900. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley's re-election in a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism. [PAR] Following the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, succeeded to the office, becoming the youngest United States President in history. Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era, he championed his \"Square Deal\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Making conservation a top priority, he established a myriad of new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. [PAR] Elected in 1904 to a full term, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, William Howard Taft, to succeed him in the presidency. After leaving office, Roosevelt went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor. He tried but failed to win the presidential nomination in 1912. Roosevelt founded his own party, the Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split among Republicans enabled the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in 1912. The Democrats in the South had also gained power by having disenfranchised most blacks (and Republicans) from the political system from 1890 to 1908, fatally weakening the Republican Party across the region, and creating a Solid South dominated by their party alone. Republicans aligned with Taft nationally would control the Republican Party for decades.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Thunderbirds (TV series)Thunderbirds is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) and distributed by ITC Entertainment. It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series were filmed, comprising a total of 32 episodes. Production ceased after Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television. [PAR] Set in the mid-2060s, Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls, Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray. It follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from IR's secret base in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines. [PAR] Thunderbirds began its first run in the United Kingdom on the ITV network in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. As well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns, the series has been followed by two feature-length film sequels, a live-action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute. The second of two TV remakes, the computer-animated Thunderbirds Are Go, premiered in 2015. [PAR] Widely considered to be the Andersons' most popular and commercially successful series,  Thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects (directed by Derek Meddings) and musical score (composed by Barry Gray). It is also well remembered for its title sequence, which opens with an often-quoted countdown by actor Peter Dyneley (who voiced the character of Jeff): \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1: Thunderbirds Are Go!\" A real-life rescue service, the International Rescue Corps, is named after the organisation featured in the series.

The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality:  of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for machine-made paper, while quires of 24 sheets are often used for handmade or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets. ) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, depending on the type of paper.  [PAR] Nomenclature [PAR] The current word \"quire\" derives from OE \"quair\" or \"guaer\", from OF \"quayer\", \"cayer\", (cf. modern Fr. cahier), from L. quaternum, \"by fours\", \"fourfold\". Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the association of \"quaire\" with \"four\" was quickly lost. [PAR] History [PAR] In the Middle Ages, a quire (also called a \"gathering\") was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term \"quaternion\" (or sometimes quaternum) designates such a quire. A quire made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a \"bifolium\" (plural \"bifolia\"); a \"binion\" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a \"quinion\" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian term for quire, quinterno di carta. [PAR] Formerly, when paper was packed at the paper mill, the top and bottom quires were made up of slightly damaged sheets (\"outsides\") to protect the good quires (\"insides\"). These outside quires were known as \"cassie quires\" (from Fr. cass\u00e9e, \"broken\"), or \"cording quires\" and had only 20 sheets to the quire.  The printer William Caslon in a book published in 1770 mentions both 24- and 25-sheet quires; he also details printer's wastage, and the sorting and recycling of damaged cassie quires.  An 1826 French manual on typography complained that cording quires (usually containing some salvageable paper) from the Netherlands barely contained a single good sheet.

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism. [PAR] Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election. [PAR] On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her re-election in 1983. [PAR] Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire, which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. After a series of small strokes in 2002, she was advised to withdraw from public speaking. Despite this, she managed to prerecord a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death, which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004.  In 2013, she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87.

Her father was Alfred Roberts, originally from Northamptonshire, and her mother was Beatrice Ethel (n\u00e9e Stephenson) from Lincolnshire. She spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned two grocery shops. She and her older sister Muriel (1921\u20132004) were raised in the flat above the larger of the two, on North Parade. Her father was active in local politics and the Methodist church, serving as an alderman and a local preacher, and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist  attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church. He came from a Liberal family but stood \u2013 as was then customary in local government \u2013 as an Independent. He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945\u201346 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context contains a detailed list of mythical hybrids, including a section specifically about mermaids. While the text provides a rich description of various mythical creatures, the focus on mermaids is relatively brief and straightforward. Given the need for a highly challenging question that probes deep understanding, this limited focus presents a challenge. However, we can still craft a question that requires nuanced thinking and critical engagement.\n\nDespite the limited depth in the text about mermaids, we can infer that mermaids are typically depicted as beautiful women with fish-like lower bodies. They often appear in folklore and literature as enchanting or dangerous beings. The context suggests that mermaids are part of a broader category of hybrids combining human and animal features, which raises interesting questions about their biology, behavior, and cultural significance.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Based on the lore and appearance of mermaids described in the context, how might the combination of a human upper body with a fish-like lower body pose unique challenges to the concept of hybrid survival and interaction with the physical world, and what implications could this have on their cultural representations in mythology?\nExplanation: This question requires the respondent to consider the biological and practical challenges of such a hybrid form, as well as its implications in mythological contexts. It delves into the intersection of biology, physiology, and cultural symbolism.\nCorrect Answer: The combination of a human upper body with a fish-like lower body would pose significant challenges to survival due to the different sensory and locomotive adaptations required for each part. Humans rely on vision, touch, and hearing in a terrestrial environment, while fish rely on lateral line systems and electroreception. These differences would necessitate complex physiological and behavioral adaptations, potentially limiting their ability to interact effectively with both aquatic and terrestrial environments.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Marilyn MonroeMarilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926\u00a0\u2013 August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult. Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928. The identity",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity. [PAR] Description [PAR] The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe  in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),   along with tiny traces of",

Orbits and sizes are not shown to scale. [PAR] Credit: NASA [PAR] Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, kids grew up learning about the nine planets of our solar system. That all changed starting in the late 1990s, when astronomers began to argue about whether Pluto was a planet. In a highly controversial decision , the International Astronomical Union ultimately decided in 2006 to call Pluto a \u201cdwarf planet,\u201d reducing the list of \u201creal planets\u201d in our solar system to eight.\u00a0 [PAR] However, astronomers are now hunting for another planet in our solar system, a true ninth planet , after evidence of its existence was unveiled on Jan. 20, 2016. The so-called \"Planet Nine,\" as scientists are calling it, is about 10 times the mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto. [PAR] [ Solar System Pictures: A Photo Tour ] [PAR] If you insist on including Pluto , then that world would come after Neptune on the list; Pluto is truly way out there, and on a wildly tilted, elliptical orbit (two of the several reasons it got demoted). Interestingly, Pluto used to be the eighth planet, actually. More on that below. [PAR] Terrestrial planets [PAR] The inner four worlds are called \u201c terrestrial planets ,\u201d because, like Earth, their surfaces are all rocky. Pluto, too, has a solid surface (and a very frozen one) but has never been grouped with the four terrestrials. [PAR] Jovian planets [PAR] The four large outer worlds \u2014 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune \u2014 are known as the \u201cJovian planets\u201d (meaning \u201cJupiter-like\u201d) because they are all huge compared to the terrestrial planets, and because they are gaseous in nature rather than having rocky surfaces (though some or all of them may have solid cores, astronomers say). According to NASA , \"two of the outer planets beyond the orbit of Mars \u2014 Jupiter and Saturn \u2014 are known as gas giants; the more distant Uranus and Neptune are called ice giants.\" This is because, while the first two are dominated by gas, while the last two have more ice. All four contain mostly hydrogen and helium. [PAR] Dwarf planets [PAR] The\u00a0 IAU definition of a full-fledged planet goes like this: A body that circles the sun without being some other object's satellite, is large enough to be rounded by its own gravity (but not so big that it begins to undergo nuclear fusion, like a star) and has \"cleared its neighborhood\" of most other orbiting bodies. Yeah, that\u2019s a mouthful. [PAR] The problem for Pluto, besides its small size and offbeat orbit, is that it shares its space with lots of other objects in the Kuiper Belt , beyond Neptune. Still, the demotion of Pluto remains controversial . [PAR] The IAU planet definition puts other small, round worlds in the dwarf planet category, including the Kuiper Belt objects Eris , Haumea , and Makemake . [PAR] Also now a dwarf planet is Ceres , a round object in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was actually considered a planet when discovered in 1801 and then later deemed to be an asteroid. Some astronomers like to consider Ceres as a 10th planet (not to be confused with Nibiru or Planet X ), but that line of thinking opens up the possibility of there being 13 planets, with more bound to be discovered.

[PAR] Distinguished Gentleman's Pipe : Ben is occasionally seen with one, as befits both a patriarch and a former sailor. [PAR] Distressed Dude : All the Cartwrights have found themselves held hostage at some point. Little Joe is certainly the worst offender. [PAR] Downer Ending : It's not uncommon in dramatic episodes for a good character to die within the last minute of the episode's runtime. [PAR] Early Installment Weirdness : The Cartwrights in the early episodes often confronted strangers in the Ponderosa in a hostile fashion with guns drawn. Lorne Greene convinced the producers that since the Cartwrights are such major landowners and a major business interest in the region, they logically would be more hospitable to visitors for economic, social and political purposes.

Together with then-US President George W. Bush, he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq, an act which remains highly controversial.   [PAR] From 1983 to 2007, Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under Blair's leadership, the party used the phrase \"New Labour\", to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism. Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity.  Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism.  [PAR] In May 1997, the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory, the largest in its history, allowing Blair, at 43 years old, to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In September 1997, Blair attained early personal popularity, receiving a 93% public approval rating, after his public response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.    The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership: in 2001, in which it won another landslide victory, and in 2005, with a reduced majority. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act, and Freedom of Information Act. Blair's government also carried out the devolution, the establishing of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto. In Northern Ireland, Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. [PAR] Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration, and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and, more controversially, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq, including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression.  In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary. [PAR] Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007, and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown.  On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East, which he held until 27 May 2015. He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name, including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. [PAR] Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623. [PAR] In 1616, with his health declining, Shakespeare revised his will. Since his only son Hamnet had died",

The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.\u00a0 Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.\u00a0 The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.\u00a0 The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley\" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.\u00a0 He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real. But he did have fun playing in the clouds. He made Sir Basil suffer when he shot his tail off, as he pretended to be dead. Poor Sir Basil didn't know what to do, so as usual shouted for Lady Rosemary, who saw Parsley was faking it. His best friend is Dill the dog and both of them seem to get themselves into trouble. But once in a while Parsley does come up with a good idea, such as the time he persuaded Pashana Bedhi to use his snake charming skills to float Sage and his nest back in the tree. \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley with a tail for doing jobs of every kind but I mustn't treat it roughly or too harshly for it's such a useful thing to have behind\" His songs are: \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I am always very glad to see you wave but please don't shout or speak to me too harshly because I'm not particularly brave\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I really don't like climbing things at all so please don't shout or speak to me too harshly I am sure you wouldn't want to see me fall\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I'm supposed to pull this rope and ring the bell though I try to pull it gently never harshly I'm afraid that I'm not doing very well\" \"For today I",

[PAR] On his first day at school Bernard crossed swords with caretaker Norman Potter (Deryck Guyler), a former Desert Rat with delusions of grandeur, although with some credibility as he was the right hand man of incompetent headmaster, Maurice Cromwell (Noel Howlett), who in turn was the subject of infatuation by formidable deputy head Doris Ewell (Joan Sanderson). This trio virtually ran the school much to the resignation of the rest of the disillusioned staff and the last thing they wanted to disturb the balance was a young schoolmaster fresh out of teachers training college and full of bright ideals about modern teaching. [PAR] In order to curb Bernard's na\u00efve enthusiasm it was conspired between the trio to give him a class of 'no-hopers', namely 5C. In their last year at school the pupils of this class were an uneducable bunch of delinquents who were simply biding their time until the final bell sounded on the last day of term. This of course did not involve participating in any school activities such as lessons. However, through a series of (comical) events Bernard managed to win over not only the staff but also the class of pupils (who nicknamed him 'Privet' Hedges) that contained 'hard case' Patrick Duffy (Peter Cleall), the tough talking but wimpish Frankie (Hank) Abbott (David Barry), slow witted Dennis Dunstable (Peter Denyer), flirtatious Sharon (Penny Spencer in the first two season's, Carol Hawkins thereafter), and Maureen (Liz Gebhart), who had a crush on her teacher. Support on the teacher front came from Richard Davies who gave a first class performance as the down to earth no-nonsense Welsh science teacher, Mr Price, and the aging Eric Chitty as Mr Smith, a teacher that was clearly beyond retirement age at the series outset. In fact most of the actors who played the students were already in their twenties when Please Sir! began in 1968 and two years later (at the end of the longest last year in school history) the pupils were clearly showing their age. [PAR] The series made stars of several actors although oddly none of the students found lasting television fame. LWT Head of Light Entertainment, Frank Muir, cast Alderton as Bernard Hedges after he had spotted him as a teacher in the opening episode of Never A Cross Word. After leaving Fenn Street School the actor went on to several successful series such as Upstairs, Downstairs, it's spin-off series Thomas and Sarah, the LWT sitcom No-Honestly and a series of Wodehouse plays (Wodehouse Playhouse) for BBC (all of which Alderton co-starred alongside his wife, Pauline Collins), and the BBC sitcom My Wife Next Door with Hannah Gordon. Joan Sanderson won television immortality as Mrs Richards, the hotel guest with hearing problems in Fawlty Towers and after Please Sir! had finished she teamed up again with Deryck Guyler (who was originally cast as Fenn Street's headmaster) on a BBC radio show (also penned by the same writers), You're Only Young Once. [PAR] A 1971 feature movie was released in which Bernard meets and begins to date Penny Wheeler (Jill Kerman), and this was carried on in subsequent TV series of Please Sir! and its predecessor, The Fenn Street Gang (which in turn spawned Bowler), which briefly followed the fortunes of the pupils after they left school. [PAR] The series was the creation of former school chums and a new-to-television comedy writing team of John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, who went on to write Get Some In!; Ever Decreasing Circles; As Time Goes By and the enormously successful The Good Life.

After an affair and secretly impregnating Leto, Leto had to give birth to Aretmis while being chased by the Python sent by Hera. Fortunately for Leto her first child, Artemis, was birthed without any pain. However Leto had twins so her labor continued, and as weak as she was the newborn Artemis quickly took the roll as midwife and helped birth her twin brother Apollo. You could say that, of all the Greek goddesses, the goddess Artemis was literally born to serve as a nurturer and protector! It looks like though both twins had young knacks for things.

Stags to lead her chariot. [PAR] 6.      And 80 virgin nymphs to be her hunting companions. [PAR] Zeus was amused by wishes and being the good father granted her each wish she asked for. Artemis would never marry, and would be chaste for all eternity. She roamed with her hunting dogs, nymphs, and her stags, hunting all throughout the mountains where she resided. [PAR] Artemis was very protective of the chastity of her nymphs and was angered when they didn\u2019t keep their purity. In the case of Callisto, Zeus had disguised himself as Artemis and took advantage and impregnated Callisto, Artemis was furious that she was no longer chaste and blamed her loss of purity on her. Artemis then immediately irrevocably turned her into a bear. However before Artemis killed Callisto in bear form Zeus intervened turning Callisto into constellation in the stars, as Callisto the Bear, also known as Ursa Major. [PAR] The Greek goddess Artemis was frequently called upon to nurture her needy and somewhat ineffectual mother.  Many times she came to the aid of her mother healing her from sickness. Artemis very naturally became the patron saint of childbirth, the protector of children, and the goddess who especially heard the appeals of women.

She symbolizes the untamed spirit, never being tied down by things such as love, being the eternal huntress of the forests.The Greek goddess Artemis was famous for her hunting skills, especially with her bow and arrow. She had unerring aim that never missed her target.  She was a very able hunter taking down some of the most terrifying beasts with ease and grace.

EastEnders storylines examine the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in the fictional London Borough of Walford in the East End of London. The series primarily centres on the residents of Albert Square, a Victorian square of terraced houses, and its neighbouring streets, namely Bridge Street, Turpin Road and George Street. The area encompasses a pub, street market, night club, community centre, funeral parlour, caf\u00e9, wine bar, various other small businesses, a park and allotments. [PAR] The series was initially screened as two half-hour instalments per week. Since 2001, episodes are broadcast each weekday, apart from Wednesday, on BBC One. A same-day repeat was shown on BBC Three, from 2004 until 15 February 2016, after which W took over the showing. An omnibus edition was broadcast on a Sunday, from 1985 until its discontinuation, in 2015, but, as with the repeat screening, this was picked up by W in 2016. [PAR] It is one of the UK's highest-rated programmes, often appearing near or at the top of the week's BARB ratings. Within eight months of its launch, it reached the number-one spot in the ratings, and has consistently remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.  Created by producer Julia Smith and script editor Tony Holland, EastEnders has remained a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many controversial and taboo issues in British culture and social life previously unseen on United Kingdom mainstream television.  [PAR] , EastEnders has won nine BAFTA Awards and the Inside Soap Award for Best Soap for 14 years running (from 1997 to 2012),  as well as twelve National Television Awards for Most Popular Serial Drama  and 11 awards for Best Soap at the British Soap Awards.

The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice.

It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants.   Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  and is a founding member  of the INGO Accountability Charter; an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations. [PAR] Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world.   Greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge,    and influenced both the private and the public sector.   Greenpeace has also been a source of controversy;  its motives and methods (some of the latter being illegal) have received criticism,  including an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The organization's direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists,   such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat[http://www.biofortified.org/2013/06/gmo-crops-vandalized-in-oregon/ GMO crops vandalized in Oregon], Karl Haro von Mogel, Biology Fortified, 24 June 2013. and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site in Peru.  [PAR] History [PAR] Origins [PAR] In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000  people blocked a major U.S.\u2013Canadian border crossing in British Columbia, carrying signs reading \"Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes\".  The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb. [PAR] While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opposers were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. As members of the Sierra Club Canada, they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization. From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, \"bearing witness\", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence. Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club. The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay St. became the HQ.  As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, Greenpeace, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's \"quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance\". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.  Within half a year Greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in Kitsilano.

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for females, and this section will discuss about the 3 main types of female voices, their respective note ranges, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One point to note: There is a difference between the 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type; The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that the voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas Voice Type refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to learn how to find the full range of your voice, as well as understand more about the various voice classification criteria and learn how to determine your own voice type! [PAR] Now, the 3 main types of female voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Soprano [PAR] Let us look at each of these voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. SOPRANO [PAR] As many of us would know, the Soprano voice is the highest of the female voices, and many of us would be familiar with this voice type. I am sure many ladies out there would be envious of their Soprano friends who seem to be able to hit the high notes with such ease! [PAR] A typical Soprano vocal range would probably be from the A note below middle C (A3) to the F or G note 2 octaves above (F6 or G6), making it a range of 2 plus to 3 octaves. Of course, this is not to be taken as an exact measurement but more as a rough guideline for soprano voices, and proper breath support must be used when measuring vocal ranges during singing. [PAR] The Soprano Tessitura is also usually higher than the other female voice types, considering that the overall vocal range is the highest among the female voices. [PAR] A Soprano would also probably transition out of her chest voice around the E flat note above middle C (E4) and shift into her head voice around the F sharp note one octave above the middle C (F5). [PAR] The soprano voice usually has a bright tone, and she would usually have a strong head voice, but a relatively weaker middle voice. Sopranos are also able to sing more high notes and sustain at a high pitch better than a mezzo soprano can, and they are also most often the lead role for operas or shows. [PAR] 2. MEZZO SOPRANO [PAR] For most ladies out there, you would probably belong to this voice type as the Mezzo Soprano voice is the most common female voice type out of the 3 main types, and it lies between the higher Soprano voice and the lower Contralto voice. [PAR] The vocal range for the Mezzo Soprano voice would be likely between the G note below middle C (G3) to the C note more than 2 octaves above (C6), making it also a range of around slightly",

Harry was delighted and couldn't thank Hagrid enough, while Hedwig had already fallen asleep after leaving the shop. [2] This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the Dursleys did not celebrate his brithday. He became quickly attached to her. [PAR] Harry Potter's pet [PAR] Harry decided on her name after finding it in A History of Magic . Before attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Harry routinely stayed in his bedroom with Hedwig, away from the Dursleys , since she was his only friend at 4 Privet Drive . [4] Throughout her life, Hedwig provided Harry with mail service, as well as loyal companionship. Hedwig often showed Harry her affection by gently nibbling his ears and fingers, and seemed fully capable of understanding his wishes (as she faithfully followed Harry's orders to peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger until they responded to him). [PAR] Hedwig with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley [PAR] Hedwig was also highly intelligent, as she flew to France completely of her own accord while Hermione was on holiday there with her parents, just to ensure that Harry received a gift from her for his thirteenth birthday, later arriving at the Leaky Cauldron shortly after Harry stormed out of Privet Drive after a particularly bad argument despite the fact that she had been away and allegedly staying with the Weasleys when Harry left the Dursleys. According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions. She also seemed fairly disdainful of the hyperactive behaviour of Ron Weasley 's pet owl Pigwidgion (Pig, as Ron called him) [PAR] Harry having Hedwig deliver a message to Sirius Black [PAR] While living with the Dursleys , Hedwig was locked in her cage for months at a time to prevent Harry from sending messages to his \"freaky little friends.\" As a result, the first holidays after Hogwarts were a frustrating and boring time for her, as much as for Harry. When Harry was rescued by the Weasley brothers in 1992 , Hedwig was freed from her cage and flew along following behind the flying Ford Anglia all the way to The Burrow . In 1992 when Harry thought his friends had forgotten him, he mused that Hedwig was the only reason he knew that discovering the wizarding world had not just been a dream. Fortunately, her frustrated hooting during her first year with them convinced the Dursleys to subsequently let Harry let Hedwig out for flights so long as he didn't use her to send messages, though Harry sometimes ignored this rule and possibly began ignoring it entirely after meeting Sirius Black and gaining leverage with the Dursleys.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] U.S. stateA state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). [PAR] States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. [PAR] States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  [PAR] States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. [PAR] States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state.  [PAR] The Constitution grants to Congress  the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. [PAR] The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw from) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v. White, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.   [PAR] States of the United States [PAR] The 50 U.S. states (in alphabetical order), along with state flag and date each joined the union: [PAR] Governments [PAR] As each state is itself a sovereign entity, it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. [PAR] Constitutions [PAR] The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The Constitution of Alabama, for example, contains 310,296 words \u2014 more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution. In practice, each state has adopted a three-branch system of government, modeled after the federal government, and consisting of three branches (although the three-branch structure is not required): executive, legislative, and judicial.

As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. [PAR] Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College. His first of many books, The Naval War of 1812 (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the American West and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders, where he gained national fame for courage during the Spanish\u2013American War. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president as McKinley's running mate in the election of 1900. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley's re-election in a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism. [PAR] Following the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, succeeded to the office, becoming the youngest United States President in history. Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era, he championed his \"Square Deal\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Making conservation a top priority, he established a myriad of new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. [PAR] Elected in 1904 to a full term, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, William Howard Taft, to succeed him in the presidency. After leaving office, Roosevelt went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor. He tried but failed to win the presidential nomination in 1912. Roosevelt founded his own party, the Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split among Republicans enabled the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in 1912. The Democrats in the South had also gained power by having disenfranchised most blacks (and Republicans) from the political system from 1890 to 1908, fatally weakening the Republican Party across the region, and creating a Solid South dominated by their party alone. Republicans aligned with Taft nationally would control the Republican Party for decades. [PAR] Frustrated at home, Roosevelt led a two-year expedition in the Amazon Basin, nearly dying of tropical disease. During World War I, he opposed President Woodrow Wilson for keeping the U.S. out of the war against Germany, and offered his military services, which were never summoned. Although planning to run again for president in 1920, Roosevelt suffered deteriorating health and died in early 1919.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Tony BlairAnthony Charles Lynton Blair (born 6 May 1953) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007. Together with then-US President George W. Bush, he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq, an act which remains highly controversial.   [PAR] From 1983 to 2007, Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under Blair's leadership, the party used the phrase \"New Labour\", to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism. Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity.  Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism.  [PAR] In May 1997, the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory, the largest in its history, allowing Blair, at 43 years old, to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In September 1997, Blair attained early personal popularity, receiving a 93% public approval rating, after his public response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.    The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership: in 2001, in which it won another landslide victory, and in 2005, with a reduced majority. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act, and Freedom of Information Act. Blair's government also carried out the devolution, the establishing of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto. In Northern Ireland, Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. [PAR] Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration, and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and, more controversially, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq, including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression.  In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary. [PAR] Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007, and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown.  On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East, which he held until 27 May 2015. He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name, including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.  [PAR] Early life [PAR] Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland,  on 6 May 1953,   the second son of Leo and Hazel ( Corscadden) Blair. Leo Blair, the illegitimate  son of two English actors, had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife, Mary. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and later died in) Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1923, where his wife, Sarah Margaret (n\u00e9e Lipsett), gave birth to Blair's mother, Hazel, above the family's grocery shop.  [PAR] Blair has one elder brother, Sir William Blair, a High Court judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh. [PAR] In the 1950s, his family spent three and a half years in Adelaide, South Australia, where his father was a lecturer in law at the University of Adelaide.  The Blairs lived close to the",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen English counties and cover 9.3% of England, with no national park in the central counties. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land.

The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets. [PAR] The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. [PAR] The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway. The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge. [PAR] History [PAR] Inception [PAR] In the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the East End of London led to a requirement for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London. [PAR] A Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect (who was also one of the judges),  was approved. [PAR] Jones' engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry, devised the idea of a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. [PAR] Construction [PAR] Construction started in 1887 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.  \u2013 and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. [PAR] Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance. [PAR] Jones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa\u00e7ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was \u00a31,184,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ). [PAR] Opening [PAR] The bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife, The Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark).

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] St Trinian's SchoolSt Trinian's was a British gag cartoon comic strip series, created and drawn by Ronald Searle from 1946 until 1952.  The cartoons all centre on a boarding school for girls, where the teachers are sadists and the girls are juvenile delinquents. The series was Searle's most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films that has outlived the short-running cartoon series. [PAR] Concept [PAR] The first cartoon appeared in 1941, but shortly afterwards Searle had to fulfil his military service. He was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 he started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was a lot darker in comparison with the previous years. [PAR] The school is the antithesis of the type of posh girls' boarding school depicted by Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil; its female pupils are bad and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the uniform of the school that Searle's daughter Kate attended, JAGS in Dulwich. The films implied that the girls were the daughters of gangsters, crooks, shady bookmakers, and other low-lifes and the institution is often referred to as a \"female borstal\". [PAR] The inspiration [PAR] During 1941 Searle had left for the artist's community in the village of Kirkcudbright in Edinburgh and it was whilst visiting the family Johnston there that he made a drawing to please their two schoolgirl daughters, C\u00e9cil\u00e9 and Pat, (their school had been evacuated to New Gala House in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders owing to the war), and Searle was puzzled as to why two schoolgirls should seem so keen to return to their school, an Academy for Young Ladies in Dalkeith Road \u2014 the name of their school was St Trinnean's.   [PAR] Searle's St. Trinian's was based on two independent girls' schools in Cambridge\u2014Perse School for Girls, now known as the co-educational Stephen Perse Foundation, and St Mary's School. Searle, growing up in Cambridge, saw the girls on their way to and from school on a regular basis and they were the original inspiration for the cartoons and the character. Testaments to this fact can be found in the Perse School for Girls' Archive area where there are several original  St Trinian's books, given to the school by Ronald Searle. He also based the school partly on the former Cambridgeshire High School for Girls (now Long Road Sixth Form College).  [PAR] Books [PAR] * Hurrah for St Trinian's (1948) [PAR] * The Female Approach (1950) [PAR] * Back to the Slaughterhouse (1952) [PAR] * The Terror of St Trinians or Angela's Prince Charming (1952; text by Timothy Shy, pen-name for D. B. Wyndham-Lewis) [PAR] * Souls in Torment (1953) [PAR] Films [PAR] In the 1950s, a series of St Trinians comedy films was made featuring well-known British actors including Alastair Sim (in drag as the headmistress, but also playing her brother), George Cole as spiv \"Flash Harry\", Joyce Grenfell as Sgt Ruby Gates, a beleaguered policewoman, and Richard Wattis and Eric Barker as the civil servants at the Ministry of Education for whom the school is a source of constant frustration and nervous breakdowns.  Searle's cartoons appeared in the films' main title design. [PAR] In the films the school became embroiled in various shady enterprises, thanks mainly to Flash, and, as a result, was always threatened with closure by the Ministry. (In the last of the original four, this became the \"Ministry of Schools\", possibly because of fears of a libel action from a real Minister of Education.)

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Napoleon Bonaparte - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.comNapoleon Bonaparte - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com [PAR] Google [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Education and Early Military Career [PAR] Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon\u2019s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 1799, during Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt, a French soldier named Pierre Francois Bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the Rosetta Stone. This artifact provided the key to cracking the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years. [PAR] As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. [PAR] In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. [PAR] In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general. [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Rise to Power [PAR] Since 1792, France\u2019s revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various European nations. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria, one of his country\u2019s primary rivals, in a series of battles in Italy. In 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French. [PAR] The following year, the Directory, the five-person group that had governed France since 1795, offered to let Napoleon lead an invasion of England. Napoleon determined that France\u2019s naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior British Royal Navy. Instead, he proposed an invasion of Egypt in an effort to wipe out British trade routes with India. Napoleon\u2019s troops scored a victory against Egypt\u2019s military rulers, the Mamluks, at the Battle of the Pyramids in July 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the British at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. In early 1799, Napoleon\u2019s army launched an invasion of Ottoman-ruled Syria, which ended with the failed siege of Acre, located in modern-day Israel. That summer, with the political situation in France marked by uncertainty, the ever-ambitious and cunning Napoleon opted to abandon his army in Egypt and return to France. [PAR] The Coup of 18 Brumaire [PAR] In November 1799, in an event known as the coup of 18 Brumaire, Napoleon was part of a group that successfully overthrew the French Directory. [PAR] The Directory was replaced with a three-member Consulate, and Napoleon became first consul, making him France\u2019s leading political figure. In June 1800, at the Battle of Marengo, Napoleon\u2019s forces defeated",
