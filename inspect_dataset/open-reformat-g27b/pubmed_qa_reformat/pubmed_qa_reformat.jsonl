    "orig_question": "Cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome: a causative link?",
    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.\n\nA seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.\n\n",
    "response": "```xml\n<document_analysis>\n<thought_process>The provided text details a rare case of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in a seven-year-old girl with characteristics suggestive of Say-Barber-Miller syndrome.

The original question is extremely simplistic (\"yes\" as an answer is not indicative of expert understanding). I will rephrase the question to require a more nuanced understanding of the case presented in the text, focusing on the novelty and the proposed connection between the syndrome and the infection. The complexity will be rated as a 6, requiring the test-taker to recall details of the case and the author's hypothesis.

Given this clinical presentation, what makes this case of tuberculosis particularly noteworthy, as highlighted by the authors, and what potential relationship do they propose between the patient\u2019s condition and the development of tuberculosis?\nExplanation: The authors emphasize the rarity of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis occurring in an immunocompetent child, and the simultaneous presence of features suggestive of Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. They posit a possible causative link between the syndrome and the susceptibility to, or manifestation of, tuberculosis.\nCorrect Answer: This case is noteworthy because the occurrence of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent child is previously undescribed, and the patient also exhibits characteristics consistent with Say-Barber-Miller syndrome.

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "Rates of active travel vary by socio-economic position, with higher rates generally observed among less affluent populations. Aspects of both social and built environments have been shown to affect active travel, but little research has explored the influence of physical environmental characteristics, and less has examined whether physical environment affects socio-economic inequality in active travel. This study explored income-related differences in active travel in relation to multiple physical environmental characteristics including air pollution, climate and levels of green space, in urban areas across England. We hypothesised that any gradient in the relationship between income and active travel would be least pronounced in the least physically environmentally-deprived areas where higher income populations may be more likely to choose active transport as a means of travel.\n\nAdults aged 16+ living in urban areas (n\u2009=\u200920,146) were selected from the 2002 and 2003 waves of the UK National Travel Survey. The mode of all short non-recreational trips undertaken by the sample was identified (n\u2009=\u2009205,673). Three-level binary logistic regression models were used to explore how associations between the trip being active (by bike/walking) and three income groups, varied by level of multiple physical environmental deprivation.\n\nLikelihood of making an active trip among the lowest income group appeared unaffected by physical environmental deprivation; 15.4% of their non-recreational trips were active in both the least and most environmentally-deprived areas. The income-related gradient in making active trips remained steep in the least environmentally-deprived areas because those in the highest income groups were markedly less likely to choose active travel when physical environment was 'good', compared to those on the lowest incomes (OR\u2009=\u20090.44, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.22 to 0.89).\n\n",

The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity.\n\n100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated.\n\nDifferences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia.

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\n\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\n\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up.

While overall cancer incidence was slightly lower in the bezafibrate group (5.25% vs. 6.51%), the most notable difference was observed in colon cancer rates: 0.53% in the bezafibrate group compared to 1.13% in the placebo group. Although the Fisher\u2019s exact test yielded a one-sided p-value of 0.05 and a two-sided p-value of 0.07, and the effect was only detectable after a four-year lag, multivariable analysis showed a hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% CI 0.2-1.1) for colon cancer risk in the bezafibrate group. Based on these findings, can it be conclusively stated that bezafibrate prevents the development of colon cancer in this patient population, and what caveats should be considered when interpreting these results?\nExplanation: The study demonstrates a trend toward lower colon cancer risk with bezafibrate, indicated by the hazard ratio and reduced incidence. However, the p-value is not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level, meaning the observed difference could be due to chance.

Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals.\n\nThe group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours.

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.\n\nHistological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT.\n\n",

Apical vertebra or disc is defined as the most laterally deviated vertebra or disc in a scoliosis curve, but the most rotated vertebra (or disc) has not been included in this terminology. One study suggested that the most rotated vertebral level was always located at the apex.\n\nThirty-three structural curves of 25 consecutive patients scheduled for surgery for thoracic or thoracolumbar scoliosis were analyzed with standing anteroposterior radiographs and computed tomography scans covering the curve apexes and pelvis. Thoracic and lumbar curves were evaluated separately for all Type II curves. Vertebral rotations were normalized by the rotation of the pelvis. The most rotated vertebral (or disc) levels (transverse apex) were compared with the regional and global apex levels (vertebra or disc) (coronal apexes) of the corresponding curves separately.\n\nRegional and global apexes were at the same level in 18 (54.5%) curves, and within half a level in another 15 (45.4%), and the regional apex was one level higher in two curves (95% confidence levels: -0.82, +0.88).

The study involved 313 children, with a subset of 130 specifically studied to rule out IBD. Colonoscopies with biopsies were performed on 69 of these children, and 51 served as controls. The results indicate that 99mTc-WBC scans were positive in most cases of newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or miscellaneous colitis, with false negatives occurring in cases of mild inflammation. UGI-SBFT studies were often normal even with positive 99mTc-WBC scans.\n\nConcept Exploration: The study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of two imaging techniques (99mTc-WBC scintigraphy and UGI-SBFT) in the context of IBD, a complex and challenging diagnosis in children. The findings suggest that 99mTc-WBC scans are more sensitive than UGI-SBFT in detecting inflammation, particularly in the terminal ileum.

Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by recurrent seizures.\n\nWe searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years).\n\nUnlike that in normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining.\n\n",

The study examines protein markers associated with apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase activation via fractin) and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) in temporal lobe specimens from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.\n\nConcept Exploration: The findings present a complex picture. While there's evidence of apoptotic signaling (increased Bax, caspase activation), there's a lack of definitive evidence of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL negative) or typical apoptotic nuclear changes. This suggests that the cell death process in MTS might not be a classical apoptotic pathway, or that it's occurring through a modified or incomplete apoptotic mechanism. The increased Bcl-2 immunoreactivity is also notable, as Bcl-2 typically inhibits apoptosis.\n\nStrategic Complexity Calibration: Difficulty: 8/10.

Increased Bax and caspase activation suggest apoptotic signaling is present, but the absence of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL negative) and typical nuclear changes casts doubt on whether the cell death is following a classical apoptotic pathway. Therefore, a conclusive determination of apoptosis cannot be made based on these findings.\nCorrect Answer: The evidence suggests that while apoptotic signaling pathways may be involved, the neuronal death in MTS does not neatly fit the criteria for classical apoptosis.

    "context": "Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity.\n\nWe used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections.\n\nWe have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation.\n\n",

    "orig_question": "Does the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites result in serious acute side effects?",
    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "To determine the incidence and severity of acute side effects from the use of polyvalent antivenin in victims of rattlesnake bites.\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who presented with rattlesnake bites to a university teaching hospital during an 11-year period. From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected.\n\nPrimary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent disability at hospital discharge, and mortality.\n\nWe identified a total of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-8%). This patient had a history of previous antivenin reaction and required a short course of intravenous epinephrine for blood pressure support. No other complications occurred.\n\n",

The study found no deaths, amputations, or permanent disability in patients receiving antivenin, and acute side effects were relatively mild (primarily urticaria) and infrequent (18%).\n\nConcept Exploration: The question probes the relationship between antivenin dosage and the severity of acute side effects. The study provides data on antivenin doses given across different bite severities, indicating a trend towards higher doses for more severe bites.

    "context": "To assess the feasibility and safety of diagnostic or therapeutic semirigid ureteroscopy without ureteral meatus dilatation.\n\nA comparative, retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing ureteroscopy from January 2000 to May 2008. For data analysis purposes, the population was divided into two groups based on whether ureteroscopy had been performed with (Group 1) or without (Group 2) ureteral meatus dilatation. Variables recorded included age, sex, type of procedure, surgical diagnosis, passive or active dilatation, number of stones, stone location, stone diameter, peroperative and postoperative complications, internal urinary diversion after the procedure, therapeutic success rate, operating time, and hospital stay duration. A 8-9.8 Fr Wolf semirigid ureteroscope was used. Descriptive statistics of the population and cohorts were performed, providing medians, quartiles, and limit values for non-normally distributed interval variables, and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables. Shapiro-Wilk's, Mann-Whitney's U, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. A value of p 2 alpha<or = 0.005 was considered statistically significant. Arcus Quickstat Biomedical 1.0 software was used.\n\nAmong the 306 ureteroscopies studied, 286 performed in 256 patients were analyzed. Median age was 50 years (16-83), 59% of patients were male, and elective ureteroscopy was performed in 183 patients (64%). Group 1: 191 ureteroscopies, Group 2: 95 ureteroscopies. Stone location: 149 in distal ureter, 60 in middle ureter, and 35 in proximal ureter. Sixty-nine percent of stones had sizes ranging from 5 and 10 mm. The overall success rate was 86.5%.

We estimated life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) associated with available treatments for localized prostate cancer in men aged>/= 65 years, adjusting for Gleason score, patient preferences, and comorbidity.\n\nWe evaluated three treatments, using a decision-analytic Markov model: radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and watchful waiting (WW). Rates of treatment complications and pretreatment incontinence and impotence were derived from published studies. We estimated treatment efficacy using three data sources: cancer registry cohort data, pooled case series, and modern radiotherapy studies. Utilities were obtained from 141 prostate cancer patients and from published studies.\n\nFor men with well-differentiated tumors and few comorbidities, potentially curative therapy (RP or EBRT) prolonged LE up to age 75 years but did not improve QALE at any age. For moderately differentiated cancers, potentially curative therapy resulted in LE and QALE gains up to age 75 years. For poorly differentiated disease, potentially curative therapy resulted in LE and QALE gains up to age 80 years. Benefits of potentially curative therapy were restricted to men with no worse than mild comorbidity.

The purpose of this study was to compare DT with noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and to evaluate its potential role for the follow-up of patients with nephrolithiasis in a nonemergent setting.\n\nA retrospective review of patients with nephrolithiasis at our institution that underwent NCCT and DT from July 2012 to September 2013 was performed. Renal units (RUs) that did not undergo treatment or stone passage were randomly assigned to two blinded readers, who recorded stone count, size area (mm(2)), maximum stone length (mm), and location, for both DT and NCCT. Mean differences per RU were compared. Potential variables affecting stone detection rate, including stone size and body mass index (BMI), were evaluated. Interobserver agreement was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient to measure the consistency of measurements made by the readers.\n\nDT and NCCT demonstrated similar stone detection rates in terms of stone counts and stone area mm(2).

Results indicated that EUS demonstrated higher sensitivity for both T (94%) and N (92%) staging compared to MDCT and MRI, while MDCT and MRI exhibited superior specificity for T staging (91% and 89%, respectively). Furthermore, the addition of MRI to either MDCT or EUS did not yield statistically significant improvements in sensitivity. Based on these findings, what conclusion can be drawn regarding the role of MRI in the preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer?\nExplanation: The study demonstrates that while MRI offers good specificity, EUS provides higher sensitivity for both T and N staging. Importantly, adding MRI to MDCT or EUS does not significantly improve sensitivity. Therefore, based on the data, MRI does not appear to offer a substantial benefit over the combination of MDCT and EUS for preoperative staging.\nCorrect Answer: MRI does not offer a significant advantage and may not be necessary in preoperative locoregional staging of gastric cancer when used in conjunction with MDCT or EUS.\n</output_format>\n```",

    "context": "Stock et al. (Eur Respir J 25:47-53, 2005) recently estimated asthma prevalence in Germany using claims data on prescriptions and hospital diagnoses and found high prevalence peaks in infants. Our objective was to critically assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using prescription data.\n\nWe replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. using data on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gm\u00fcnder ErsatzKasse (GEK) in 2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 children aged 0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006.\n\nIn children aged 0-4 years insured in the GEK, prevalences were found to range from 11.7 to 17.7% for boys and from 7.2 to 11.1% for girls when the criteria of Stock et al. were applied. A steady decline in prevalences was observed in older age groups. Asthma prevalence estimated in the KiGGS data showed a quite different distribution. In the age group 0-4 years, prevalences were found to range from 0 to 2.6% in boys and from 0 to 1.0% in girls; in children>4 years, prevalences were found to increase with increasing age.\n\n",

Forty-five patients (36\u00a0%) had undergone c-kit mutation testing. Exon 11 was seen in 25 patients (55.5\u00a0%), 3 with exon 9 (6.7\u00a0%) and 2 with exon 13 (4.4\u00a0%). Twelve were wild type (26.6\u00a0%) and \u00a03 (6.7 %) were declared uninterpretable.

The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee extension (0\u00b0) and flexion (90\u00b0) angle were recorded in three different patella positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used.\n\nThe gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p<0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position.

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer.\n\nForty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up.\n\nThe surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in each case.

    "context": "To explore whether early treatment would shorten the duration of headache from headache onset to its peak and reduce headache severity at peak.\n\nPrior clinical studies almost exclusively focused on headache relief after dosing. No data are available on whether early intervention affects the duration from headache onset to peak and headache severity at peak.\n\nAdult migraineurs were enrolled in this observational study from multi-site headache clinics. Patients recorded their migraine experiences via an electronic diary over 1 month. Patients reported the time and pain severity at onset, dosing, and peak. We used a linear mixed model to evaluate the impact of the timing of treatment and to adjust for covariates and correlation of observations within subjects.\n\nA total of 182 patients reported 970 migraine episodes, 620 of which were treated before headaches progressed to peak. Mean time from headache onset to peak varied from 1.9 hours to 8.9 hours for patients treated within 15 minutes of onset and those who waited for 4 or more hours, respectively. However, early intervention was not associated with reduced headache severity at peak. In multivariate analysis, early treatment, use of triptans, and mild migraine headache in the past 3 months were significantly associated with shorter time from onset to headache peak. A separate model indicated that the timing of medication was not associated with the duration between dosing and headache peak, but use of triptans shortened the time from dosing to headache peak.\n\n",

A gender difference in survival was studied in all patients, in those divided according to histology or pathologic stage, and in propensity-matched gender pairs.\n\nThere were no differences in background, such as preoperative pulmonary function, operation procedures, or operative mortality. The proportions of adenocarcinoma and pathologic stage I in women were greater than those in men (93.6% vs 61.7% and 71.4% vs 58.6%, respectively) (P<.001). Overall 5-year survival of women was better than that of men (81% vs 70%, P<.001). In adenocarcinoma, the overall 5-year survival for women was better than that for men in pathologic stage I (95% vs 87%, P<.001) and in pathologic stage II or higher (58% vs 51%, P = .017). In non-adenocarcinoma, there was no significant gender difference in survival in pathologic stage I (P = .313) or pathologic stage II or higher (P = .770).

The study highlights that women generally exhibit better overall 5-year survival rates compared to men (81% vs 70%, P<.001). However, this difference appears to be largely attributable to histological subtypes, specifically adenocarcinoma. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and early-stage disease.  Survival benefits for women were observed in adenocarcinoma cases, particularly in stages I and II or higher, but not in non-adenocarcinoma cases. Propensity score matching, accounting for factors like age, smoking status, and stage, failed to demonstrate a significant gender difference in survival.\n\nConcept Exploration:\nThe study challenges the simple notion of a universal gender difference in lung cancer survival. It suggests that observed differences are not inherent but are instead linked to the prevalence of adenocarcinoma in women, which has a better prognosis, especially in early stages. The propensity score matching is crucial as it attempts to control for confounding variables, suggesting the initial observed survival difference is potentially biased.\n\nStrategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 8/10.

    "context": "Occlusion of the descending aorta and infusion of oxygenated ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin may improve the efficacy of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Because selective aortic perfusion and oxygenation (SAPO) directly increases coronary perfusion pressure, exogenous epinephrine may not be required. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exogenous epinephrine is necessary during SAPO by comparing the rate of return of spontaneous circulation and aortic and coronary perfusion pressures during ACLS-SAPO in animals treated with either intra-aortic epinephrine or saline solution.\n\nA prospective, randomized, interventional before-after trial with a canine model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest and ACLS based on external chest compression was performed. The ECG, right atrial, aortic arch, and esophageal pulse pressures were measured continuously. A descending aortic occlusion balloon catheter was placed through the femoral artery. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, and no therapy was given during the 10-minute arrest time. Basic life support was then initiated and normalized by standardization of esophageal pulse pressure and central aortic blood gases. After 3 minutes of basic life support, the aortic occlusion balloon was inflated, and 0.01 mg/kg epinephrine or saline solution was administered through the aortic catheter followed by 450 mL of ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin over 2 minutes.

However, surgeons with such training and experience may not always be available to all patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trauma training affects the post-operative difference in femoral version (DFV) following IMN.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2009, 417 consecutive patients with diaphyseal femur fractures (AO/OTA 32A-C) were treated via IMN. Inclusion criteria for this study included complete baseline and demographic documentation as well as pre-operative films for fracture classification and post-operative CT scanogram (per institutional protocol) for version and length measurement of both the nailed and uninjured femurs. Exclusion criteria included bilateral injuries, multiple ipsilateral lower extremity fractures, previous injury, and previous deformity. Of the initial 417 subjects, 355 patients met our inclusion criteria. Other data included in our analysis were age, sex, injury mechanism, open vs. closed fracture, daytime vs. nighttime surgery, mechanism of injury, and AO and Winquist classifications. Post-operative femoral version of both lower extremities was measured on CT scanogram by an orthopaedic trauma fellowship trained surgeon. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine statistically significant risk factors for malrotation between the two cohorts.\n\nOverall, 80.3% (288/355) of all fractures were fixed by trauma-trained surgeons. The mean post-operative DFV was 8.7\u00b0 in these patients, compared to 10.7\u00b0 in those treated by surgeons of other subspecialties. This difference was not statistically significant when accounting for other factors in a multivariate model (p>0.05). The same statistical trend was true when analyzing outcomes of only the more severe Winquist type III and IV fractures. Additionally, surgeon experience was not significantly predictive of post-operative version for either trauma or non-trauma surgeons (p>0.05 for both).\n\n",

Some urologists advocate the need for surgical exploration, whereas others believe this is unnecessary. These differing opinions are based on the variable reports of viable germ cell elements found within the testicular remnants. To better understand the pathology associated with this syndrome and the need for surgical management, we reviewed our experience regarding the incidence of viable germ cell elements within the testicular remnant.\n\nAn institutional review board-approved, retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing exploration for a nonpalpable testis at Eastern Virginia Medical School and Geisinger Medical Center between 1994 and 2006. Patients who were found to have spermatic vessels and a vas deferens exiting a closed internal inguinal ring were included in this analysis.\n\nFifty-six patients underwent removal of the testicular remnant.

Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively.\n\nOperative mortality was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS). Upsizing (using a prosthesis larger in labeled valve size than the patient's measured internal aortic annulus diameter) was possible in 28.4% of Mosaic patients and 8.3% of Perimount patients. The postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient ranged from 10.5 to 22.2 mmHg in the Mosaic group, and from 9.4 to 12.6 mmHg in the Perimount group; it was significantly lower for 21 and 23 Perimount valves than for 21 and 23 Mosaic valves. The EOA ranged from 0.78 to 2.37 cm2 in Mosaic patients, and from 0.95 to 2.12 cm2 in Perimount patients.

    "context": "This study sought to evaluate mutations in genes encoding the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) channel in familial atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\nAlthough AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored.\n\nMutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling.\n\nOne missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration.\n\n",
    "response": "```xml\n<document_analysis>\nThoughtful Content Examination: The context describes a study investigating genetic mutations related to atrial fibrillation (AF), specifically focusing on genes encoding the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)). A single missense mutation, R14C in KCNQ1, was identified in a family with hypertension. The key finding is that this mutation's effect on channel function is revealed *only* under conditions of cellular stretch, mimicking atrial dilation.\n\nConcept Exploration: This study highlights the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors (atrial stretch) in AF development. The R14C mutation isn't inherently detrimental, but becomes functionally significant when coupled with atrial dilation, demonstrating a gene-environment interaction. The use of electrophysiological studies and computational modeling strengthens the findings.\n\nStrategic Complexity Calibration: Difficulty: 8/10. The question requires understanding of ion channel kinetics, genetic mutations, and the physiological context of atrial fibrillation. The subtlety of the stretch-dependent effect makes it challenging.\n\nIntentional Question Planning: The question aims to assess the candidate's understanding of the study's central thesis: the interaction between a genetic mutation and an environmental stressor in AF pathogenesis. The question encourages thinking about how a mutation might be \"silent\" under normal conditions but become pathogenic under specific physiological circumstances.\n</document_analysis>\n<output_format>\nQuestion: A family with a high prevalence of hypertension was found to carry a missense mutation, R14C, in the KCNQ1 gene, which encodes a component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) channel. Electrophysiological studies revealed no significant difference in channel kinetics between wild-type and mutant channels under baseline conditions or after activation with forskolin. However, upon exposure to hypotonic solution to simulate cell swelling and atrial stretch, mutant channels exhibited increased current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered kinetics, and a shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. Does this finding suggest a potential mechanistic link between inherited genetic factors and acquired environmental factors, such as atrial dilation, in the development of atrial fibrillation?\nExplanation: The study demonstrates that the R14C mutation in KCNQ1 is only functionally significant under conditions of atrial stretch, mirroring the atrial dilation observed in affected individuals. This indicates that the genetic predisposition (mutation) requires an environmental trigger (stretch) to manifest its pathogenic effect, thus linking genetic and environmental factors in AF.\nCorrect Answer: Yes\n</output_format>\n```",

    "context": "To observe if medical providers alter their prescribing patterns of three relatively expensive categories of medications provided as samples by manufacturers (focus medications) when they receive additional education from pharmacists concerning the appropriate use of lower cost alternatives (counter samples) that are made available to dispense.\n\nPretest, post-test with a control group.\n\nTwo rural, private care clinics in southeastern Idaho providing immediate care services.\n\nEight medical providers at a clinic where interventions were employed (active intervention group) and seven medical providers in a clinic where no interventions occurred (control group).\n\nMedical providers in the active intervention group had: 1) education from pharmacists concerning the appropriate use of lower-cost alternatives compared with expensive focus medications 2) counter samples and patient sample handouts available to dispense to patients at their own discretion.\n\nThe percentage of the total yearly prescriptions for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antihistamines, and acid-relief medications that consisted of focus-COX-2 NSAIDs, nonsedating antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), respectively.\n\nThe prescribing behavior of medical providers in the active intervention and control groups were significantly different at baseline in all three categories of focus medications. This suggested that the results should focus on changes across the two years of the study within the intervention and control groups rather than across the two groups. Medical providers in the intervention group significantly decreased the use of COX-2 NSAID prescriptions relative to total NSAID prescriptions following active intervention (38.9% in year 1 versus 23.7% in year 2, P<0.05). Over the same two time periods, a nonstatistically significant decrease in COX-2 NSAID prescribing was seen at the control site (67.5% versus 62%, P>0.05). Education and counter sampling did not stop medical providers from significantly increasing the total yearly prescriptions for antihistamines and acid-relief medications that consisted of focus-nonsedating antihistamines (86.7% versus 93.1%, P<0.05) and PPIs (68.9% versus 86.2%, P<0.05). Statistically significant increases in the prescribing of focus-nonsedating antihistamines (77.9% versus 98.3%, P<0.05) and PPIs (77.5% versus 91.4%, P<0.05) were also observed in the control group.\n\n",
