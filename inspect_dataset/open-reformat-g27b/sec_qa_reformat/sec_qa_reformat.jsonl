    },
    "answer": "It enhances security by dividing the network into smaller, more manageable sections, isolating potential security breaches.",
    "explanation": "Network segmentation is a security technique that involves dividing a network into multiple segments or subnets. This practice enhances security by isolating sections of the network. If a breach occurs in one segment, it can be contained and prevented from spreading to other parts of the network. Segmentation also allows for more granular security policies, tailored to the specific needs and risks of each segment.",

    "explanation": "Multi-Factor Authentication significantly enhances security by requiring multiple independent credentials for user verification. This approach makes it much harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access since compromising one factor (like a password) is not enough; they would also need to bypass the additional authentication layers (like a fingerprint or a one-time code).",
