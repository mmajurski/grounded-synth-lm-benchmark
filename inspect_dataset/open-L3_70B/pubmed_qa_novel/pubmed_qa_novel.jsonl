Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.\n\nNo statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P\u2009<\u20090.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P\u2009=\u20090.002).

Patient survival and impact on kidney graft function and survival were evaluated.\n\nSecond pancreas survival of the 17 patients transplanted from 1995 was close to primary graft survival of the whole population (71% vs. 79% at 1 year and 59% vs. 69% at 5 years; P=0.5075) and significantly better than their first pancreas survival (71% vs. 29% at 1 year and 59% vs. 7% at 5 years; P=0.0008) regardless of the cause of first pancreas loss. The same results were observed with all 37 retransplantations. Survival of second simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations was better than survival of second pancreas after kidney. Patient survival was excellent (89% at 5 years). Pancreas retransplantation had no impact on kidney graft function and survival (100% at 5 years).\n\n",

In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely positive in as many as 30% of cases. Here we report the results of SLN biopsy in a selected group of breast cancer patients with palpable axillary nodes classified as either moderately or highly suspicious for metastasis.\n\nAmong 2,027 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures performed by two experienced surgeons, clinically suspicious axillary nodes were identified in 106, and categorized as group 1 (asymmetric enlargement of the ipsilateral axillary nodes moderately suspicious for metastasis, n = 62) and group 2 (clinically positive axillary nodes highly suspicious for metastasis, n = 44).\n\nClinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients (43 of 106) overall, and was falsely positive in 53% of patients (33 of 62) with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients (10 of 44) with highly suspicious nodes.

The fibula head predicts reliably the location of PCL footprint; however, it is not accessible during TKA. The aim of this study now was to analyze whether the tibial tuberosity can serve as a reliable referencing landmark to estimate the PCL footprint height prior to tibial cut.\n\nThe first consecutive case series included 216 CR TKA. Standing postoperative lateral view radiographs were utilized to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and tibial osteotomy plane. In the second case series, 223 knee MRIs were consecutively analyzed to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and PCL footprint. The probability of partial or total PCL removal was calculated for different vertical distances between tibial tuberosity and tibial cutting surface.\n\nThe vertical distance between the tibial tuberosity and tibial cut averaged 24.7 \u00b1 4 mm. The average vertical distance from tibial tuberosity to proximal and to distal PCL footprint was found to be 22 \u00b1 4.4 and 16 \u00b1 4.4 mm, respectively. Five knees were considered at 50% risk of an entire PCL removal after CR TKA.\n\n",

At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and hospitalization costs.\n\nThis retrospective cohort study involved data collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia and analgesia program was introduced.\n\nThe average cost of hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs.

However, preoperative anemia seems to be a risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes in certain surgical patients. This study investigated the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to determine if preoperative anemia in patients undergoing open and laparoscopic colectomies is an independent predictor for an adverse composite outcome (CO) consisting of myocardial infarction, stroke, progressive renal insufficiency or death within 30 days of operation, or for an increased hospital length of stay (LOS).\n\nHematocrit levels were categorized into 4 classes: severe, moderate, mild, and no anemia. From 2005 to 2008, the NSQIP database recorded 23,348 elective open and laparoscopic colectomies that met inclusion criteria. Analyses using multivariable models, controlling for potential confounders and stratifying on propensity score, were performed.\n\nCompared with nonanemic patients, those with severe, moderate, and mild anemia were more likely to have the adverse CO with odds ratios of 1.83 (95% CI 1.05 to 3.19), 2.19 (95 % CI 1.63 to 2.94), and 1.49 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.86), respectively.

Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ).\n\nPatients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test.\n\nSeventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).\n\n",

Those were defined as anterior, anterior-superior and superior zones, respectively. These labral positions were drilled at defined zones. After measurements, depth of the bone at 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 drill angles on zones was compared statistically.\n\nAcetabular bone widths at investigated labral insertion points did not statistically differ. A total of 14 injuries in 60 penetrations occurred (23.3\u00a0%) with free drill penetrations, and no injuries occurred with stopped drill penetrations. The bone depth was gradually decreasing from 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 drill angles and from anterior to superior inserting zones without significant importance. The risk of perforation to the pelvic cavity started with 20\u00a0mm drill depth, and the mean depth for all insertions was calculated as 31.7\u00a0mm (SD 2.6).\n\n",

This decrease in blood loss could concentrate the red blood cells in the remaining blood volume, leading to higher hematocrit levels.\n\nThe strategic complexity calibration for this question is rated as 8 out of 10, considering the need to understand the relationship between QC-ACS application, blood loss, and hematocrit levels, as well as the physiological implications of these changes.\n\nThe decision to generate a question based on this analysis is justified by the meaningful content of the provided context, which offers valuable insights into the effects of QC-ACS on hemorrhage control and physiological parameters.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the most plausible explanation for the increased hematocrit levels observed in the QC group following the application of QC-ACS in a swine extremity arterial injury model?\nExplanation: The increased hematocrit levels are likely due to the decreased total blood loss resulting from the application of QC-ACS, which concentrates the red blood cells in the remaining blood volume.\nCorrect Answer: Decreased blood loss.\n</output_format>",

During their second year, these students took four CPEs that each used three standardized patient (SP) cases, for a total of 12 cases.

Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models.\n\nC3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic\u00ae, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air\n\nn=4, SCCVII, n=5) and under hypoxic conditions (10% O(2) breathing\n\nn=4).\n\nOn AR, under both ambient air and hypoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes.

The differences in overall image quality across the four groups were not statistically significant.\n\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a question that probes the domain expert's understanding of the statistical analysis of the differences in SNR and CNR between the 0.5 mL/second and 1 mL/second injection rate groups in the context of MR angiography, we first examine the provided context. The study involves 72 consecutive patients randomly assigned to four groups, each undergoing MR angiography with different concentrations and amounts of gadolinium chelate injected at varying rates. The key metrics analyzed are the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the abdominal aorta and its major branches, along with the subjective rating of image qualities by two blinded readers.\n\nThe critical piece of information for our question topic is the comparison of SNR and CNR values between the groups injected at 0.5 mL/second and 1 mL/second. The context explicitly states that the SNR and CNR of the abdominal aorta and the common iliac artery in the 0.5 mL/second groups were statistically significantly lower than those in the 1 mL/second groups. This suggests a direct impact of the injection rate on the image quality metrics.\n\nGiven this information, we aim to craft a question that would challenge a domain expert's understanding of statistical analysis in the context of medical imaging, specifically focusing on the implications of injection rate on image quality metrics like SNR and CNR.\n\nThoughtful consideration leads to the realization that an insightful question would involve understanding the statistical significance of the differences observed and how these differences might influence clinical practice or further research. Thus, the question should encourage reflection on the methodological aspects of the study and their implications for medical imaging.\n\nThe difficulty level of the question should be high (8/10) to ensure it challenges even the most knowledgeable domain experts, requiring a deep understanding of statistical analysis, medical imaging principles, and the clinical implications of varying injection rates in MR angiography.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What statistical parameter is most relevant to understanding the clinical significance of the observed differences in SNR and CNR between the 0.5 mL/second and 1 mL/second injection rate groups in MR angiography?\nExplanation: The question requires the domain expert to consider the statistical analysis and its implications for clinical practice, focusing on the parameter that would best explain the significance of the observed differences in image quality metrics.\nCorrect Answer: Effect size.\n</output_format>",

    "context": "The use of the private sector for health care is increasing, but it is unclear whether this will reduce demand on the NHS. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between private and NHS outpatient referral rates accounting for their association with deprivation.\n\nThis is a prospective survey of general practitioner referrals to private and NHS consultant-led services between 1 January and 31 December 2001 from 10 general practices in the Trent Focus Collaborative Research Network, United Kingdom. Patient referrals were aggregated to give private and NHS referral rates for each electoral ward in each practice.\n\nOf 17,137 referrals, 90.4 percent (15,495) were to the NHS and 9.6 percent (1642) to the private sector. Private referral rates were lower in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared with the least deprived fifth (rate ratio 0.25, 95 percent CI 0.15 to 0.41, p<0.001), whereas NHS referral rates were slightly higher in patients in the most deprived fifth of wards (rate ratio 1.18, 95 percent CI 0.98 to 1.42, p = 0.08) both after age standardisation and adjustment for practice. The NHS referral rate was significantly higher (rate ratio 1.40, 95 percent CI 1.15 to 1.71, p = 0.001) in wards with private referral rates in the top fifth compared with the bottom fifth after adjustment for deprivation and practice.\n\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses a study examining the relationship between private and NHS outpatient referral rates, accounting for their association with deprivation. The study collected data from 10 general practices in the United Kingdom between 2001 and 2002, analyzing 17,137 referrals. The key findings include lower private referral rates in more deprived areas and slightly higher NHS referral rates in these areas. The study also found a significant difference in NHS referral rates between wards with high and low private referral rates.\n\nTo address the question topic, we need to consider the role of age standardization and adjustment for practice in analyzing referral rates. Age standardization is a statistical method used to account for differences in age distributions between populations, ensuring that comparisons are not biased by age-related factors. Adjustment for practice refers to accounting for variations between different general practices, such as differences in patient populations, practice sizes, or referral policies.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that age standardization and adjustment for practice are crucial in interpreting the results. For instance, the difference in NHS referral rates between wards with high and low private referral rates remained significant after adjusting for deprivation and practice, indicating that these factors do not entirely explain the observed differences.\n\nGiven the complexity of the topic and the need for nuanced understanding, a thoughtful and probing question can be generated to encourage reflection and insight.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do age standardization and adjustment for practice influence the comparison of referral rates between private and NHS services, and what implications do these methodological considerations have for understanding the relationship between deprivation and healthcare utilization?\nExplanation: The question requires the test-taker to consider the statistical methods used to analyze referral rates and how these methods impact the interpretation of the study's findings. Age standardization and adjustment for practice are essential to ensure that comparisons between private and NHS services are fair and unbiased. The correct answer should demonstrate an understanding of these methodological considerations and their implications for understanding the relationship between deprivation and healthcare utilization.\nCorrect Answer: They reduce confounding variables and provide a more accurate comparison.\n</output_format>",
