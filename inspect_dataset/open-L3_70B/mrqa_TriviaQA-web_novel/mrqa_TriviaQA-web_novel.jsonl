The state is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the United States. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Tallahassee is the state capital. [PAR] A peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida, it has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately 1350 mi, and is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. The American alligator, American crocodile, Florida panther, and manatee can be found in the Everglades National Park. [PAR] Since the first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u00a0\u2013 who named it La Florida ( \"land of flowers\") upon landing there in the Easter season, Pascua Florida \u00a0\u2013 Florida was a challenge for the European colonial powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Native Americans, and racial segregation after the American Civil War. [PAR] Today, Florida is distinctive for its large Cuban expatriate community and high population growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues. The state's economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also renown for amusement parks, orange crops, the Kennedy Space Center, and as a popular destination for retirees. [PAR] Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and Latino, and African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. Florida has attracted many writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes. It is internationally known for golf, tennis, auto racing and water sports. [PAR] History [PAR] By the 16th century, the earliest time for which there is a historical record, major Native American groups included the Apalachee (of the Florida Panhandle), the Timucua (of northern and central Florida), the Ais (of the central Atlantic coast), the Tocobaga (of the Tampa Bay area), the Calusa (of southwest Florida) and the Tequesta (of the southeastern coast). [PAR] European arrival [PAR] Florida was the first part of the continental United States to be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Ponce de Le\u00f3n spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named the region La Florida (\"land of flowers\"). The story that he was searching for the Fountain of Youth is a myth.  [PAR] \"In May 1539, Conquistador Hernando de Soto skirted the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. He described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching as high as 70 ft, with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult. Very soon, 'many smokes' appeared 'along the whole coast', billowing against the sky, when the Native ancestors of the Seminole spotted the newcomers and spread the alarm by signal fires\".  The Spanish introduced Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Spanish language, and more to Florida.  Both the Spanish and French established settlements in Florida, with varying degrees of success. In 1559, Don Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano established a settlement at present-day Pensacola, making it the first attempted settlement in Florida, but it was abandoned by 1561. [PAR] In 1565,",

[PAR] Bureau of Reclamation [PAR] Grand  Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River west of Spokane, Washington, is one of the  largest structures ever built by mankind--a mass of concrete standing 550 feet  high and 5,223 feet long, or just shy of a mile. Grand Coulee contains 12 million cubic yards  of concrete, or enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami. More massive than the Great Pyramid of Giza, Grand  Coulee is listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven  civil engineering wonders of the United States. Grand Coulee's reservoir,  Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, stretches 150  miles north, almost to the Canadian border. [PAR] A concrete gravity dam, Grand Coulee took  eight years to build, employed thousands of men during the Great Depression and,  when completed in 1942, provided the enormous electrical power necessary to  make aluminum, so essential for World War II production of planes and ships. It was  Grand Coulee, as well, that powered the production of plutonium at the nearby  Hanford Site, which figured prominently in the making of the atomic bomb. [PAR] So  grand was Grand Coulee Dam that in 1941 folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote \u201cThe  Song of the Grand Coulee Dam\u201d (though he was paid to do so under contract with  the Bonneville Power Administration.) \u201cBiggest  thing built by the hand of a Man,\u201d Guthrie sang. \u201cPower that sings, boys, turbines that whine.  Waters back up the Canadian Line.\u201d [PAR] Appropriate  as the word grand is for the dam, the  name Grand Coulee actually refers to a  unique geological feature created thousands of years ago when Ice Age glaciers  blocked the ancient riverbed of the Columbia River. When water eventually traveled under the ice  dam, great floods scoured out hundreds of miles of deep gulches, or coulees, in  the Columbia River Basin. One of these, the Grand  Coulee, is four miles wide and bordered on three sides by steep cliffs. [PAR] A local  proposal to dam the Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee dated to 1918, but  the idea faced strong competition from another proposal that called for an  irrigation canal to be built from the Pend Oreille River in northern Idaho. Proponents of this latter \u201cgravity plan\u201d argued that the hydroelectricity generated from the dam was not needed. Many studies followed, including one by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which took Grand Coulee\u2019s side, recommending a high dam  at the site and the pumping of irrigation water up to the surrounding  countryside. [PAR] This recommendation took hold with the Bureau  of Reclamation, which was promoting construction of multiple-use dams, through  which the production of hydroelectric power could produce revenue to help repay the construction cost of a project. (The Reclamation Act requires that beneficiaries of a project repay those costs, and a multi-purpose project reduced the payment burden on irrigators.) The recommendation found  traction with the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in a  time of great dust bowls and economic depression. Roosevelt launched federal program after  federal program in an attempt to spur the economy by \u201cpriming the pump\u201d and  providing jobs for out-of-work Americans.  Unprecedented funds flowed to the Bureau of Reclamation as it became a  key player in the New Deal\u2019s Public Works Administration (PWA), which spent \u201cbig bucks on big projects,\u201d Grand Coulee Dam among them.

It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used to refer to actions of the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\".  [PAR] The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban  and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico  in 1829. [PAR] Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt. [PAR] The modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice President\u2014and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of \"America's Favorite Architecture\".

In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. [PAR] The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it. [PAR] President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On November 1, in 1800,  he became the first president to occupy the White House. The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania.

[PAR] Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 30 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.  The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. , the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number onesIn the United Kingdom, Christmas number ones are singles that are top of the UK Singles Chart in the week in which Christmas Day falls. Novelty songs, charity songs or songs with a Christmas theme have regularly been at the top of Christmas charts.  Traditionally the volume of record sales in the UK peaks at Christmas,  with the Christmas number one being considered especially prestigious, more so than any other time of year.    Many of the Christmas number ones were also the best-selling song of the year. Due to the common practice of dating a chart by the date on which the week ends, the Christmas chart is dated the end of the week containing 25 December, but comprises sales for the week before that. The most recent Christmas number one single is \"A Bridge over You\" by the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir.  [PAR] History [PAR] The official UK Singles Chart began in 1952 after appearing in the New Musical Express;  the positions of all songs are based on week end sale totals (from Sunday to Saturday until 2015, then from Friday to Thursday).  Before 1987 they were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.  The emergence of a serious contest for the Christmas number-one spot began in 1973 when the band Slade deliberately released \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" as an effort to reach the top of the charts on Christmas.   [PAR] Since 2002 the Christmas number one has been dominated by reality television contests, with the winners often heading straight to number one in the week before Christmas. This trend began when Popstars: The Rivals contestants released the top three singles on the Christmas chart.  From 2005 to 2008, 2010 and 2013 to 2014, the winners of The X Factor took the number-one spot on eight occasions. In 2007, the X Factor single was so much of a prohibitive favourite for number one that bookmakers started taking bets on which song would be the \"Christmas Number Two\" instead.  [PAR] Rage Against the Machine's 1992 single \"Killing in the Name\" outsold Joe McElderry in 2009 following a successful Facebook campaign.   This made them the first group to get a Christmas number one with a download-only single, and resulted in the most download sales in a single week in UK chart history. Similar campaigns in 2010 promoting acts such as Biffy Clyro, John Cage and The Trashmen were unsuccessful.  The following year, participants from reality television show The Choir outsold X Factor winners Little Mix and a host of social network campaigns for various novelty acts,   and in 2012, a supergroup cover of \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", supporting charities associated with the Hillsborough disaster, took the accolade ahead of The X Factors James Arthur.  Following the UK Charts' move to Fridays,  the 2015 Christmas number one was revealed on Christmas Day;   that year's chart was the first in a decade to not feature the X Factor winner's single in either first or second.   [PAR] Records [PAR] The Beatles are the only act to have four Christmas number ones, three consecutively starting from 1963. On two occasions, 1963 and 1967, they had both the Christmas number one and the number two, the only act to have achieved this. As part of two acts, George Michael repeated the feat with Band Aid and Wham! in 1984. Paul McCartney has been top eight times with various acts. Cliff Richard has spent four Christmasses at number one; two as a solo act, one with The Shadows and one as part of Band Aid II. The Spice Girls later equalled the record of having three consecutive Christmas number ones, from 1996 to 1998. Spice Girl Melanie C achieved a fourth Christmas number one as a member of The Justice Collective in 2012, which also gave Robbie Williams his third. [PAR] \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen, which reached the number-one spot at Christmas 1975 and 1991, is the only record to have reached the top twice. \"Mary's Boy Child\" is the only song to be Christmas number one for two entirely unrelated",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak.

These feathers grant Tex's guns the ability to swivel and fire without being touched and allow his horse and dog to speak. The context also delves into the production aspects of the show, including the use of early Supermarionation puppetry and the challenges faced by the production team.\n\nWhen analyzing the cultural significance of \"Four Feather Falls\" as a representation of the American West and its portrayal of Native American characters and themes, it is essential to consider the historical context in which the show was produced. The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a surge in popularity of American Western television shows in Britain, which likely influenced the creation of \"Four Feather Falls.\" The show's portrayal of Native American characters, such as Chief Kalamakooya and his grandson Makooya, can be seen as a reflection of the era's stereotypes and limited understanding of Native American cultures.\n\nThe use of magical feathers as a plot device can be viewed as a simplification of Native American spiritual beliefs and practices.

After graduation from Achimota College in 1930, he started his career as a teacher at Roman Catholic junior schools in Elmina and Axim and at a seminary. [PAR] Increasingly drawn to politics, Nkrumah decided to pursue further studies in the United States . He entered Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1935 and, after graduating in 1939, obtained master\u2019s degrees from Lincoln and from the University of Pennsylvania . He studied the literature of socialism , notably Karl Marx and Vladimir I. Lenin, and of nationalism , especially Marcus Garvey , the black American leader of the 1920s. Eventually, Nkrumah came to describe himself as a \u201cnondenominational Christian and a Marxist socialist.\u201d He also immersed himself in political work, reorganizing and becoming president of the African Students\u2019 Organization of the United States and Canada. He left the United States in May 1945 and went to England, where he organized the 5th Pan-African Congress in Manchester. [PAR] Meanwhile, in the Gold Coast, J.B.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] David CameronDavid William Donald Cameron (; born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016. He was the Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016, and has been Member of Parliament for Witney since 2001. Cameron identifies as a One-Nation Conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. [PAR] Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.  It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage. [PAR] Internationally, his government militarily intervened in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured a majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as Prime Minister leading a Conservative government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he chose to resign to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.  [PAR] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for reining in the United Kingdom's national debt. Conversely, he has been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of political opportunism and social elitism. Cameron appeared on the Forbes List of The World's Most Powerful People from 2010.  [PAR] Family [PAR] Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010), a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur,  Mount (born 1934), a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.  Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962. The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".  [PAR] Cameron was born in Marylebone, London,  and raised in Peasemore, Berkshire.  He has a brother, Alexander Cameron, QC (born 1963), a barrister,  and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).  [PAR] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;  Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,  who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.  [PAR] Cameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh, and English.\"  He has also referenced the German Jewish ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the Yiddish author Elia Levita.   [PAR] Education [PAR] From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its old boys. Owing to good grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early.",

[PAR] Share this: [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] Author [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] URL [PAR] Google [PAR] August 15, 1914, marks the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Panama Canal, the American-built waterway across the Isthmus of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice. [PAR] In 1902, Congress authorized the purchase of the French assets. However, the following year, when Colombia, which Panama was then a",

The tribes kept track of the seasons by giving distinctive names to each recurring full Moon. Their names were applied to the entire month in which each occurred. There was some variation in the Moon names, but in general, the same ones were current throughout the Algonquin tribes from New England to Lake Superior. European settlers followed that custom and created some of their own names. Since the lunar month is only 29 days long on the average, the full Moon dates shift from year to year. Here is the Farmers Almanac\u2019s list of the full Moon names. [PAR] \u2013 Full Wolf Moon \u2013 January Amid the cold and deep snows of midwinter, the wolf packs howled hungrily outside Indian villages. Thus, the name for January\u2019s full Moon. Sometimes it was also referred to as the Old Moon, or the Moon After Yule. Some called it the Full Snow Moon, but most tribes applied that name to the next Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Snow Moon \u2013 February Since the heaviest snow usually falls during this month, native tribes of the north and east most often called February\u2019s full Moon the Full Snow Moon. Some tribes also referred to this Moon as the Full Hunger Moon, since harsh weather conditions in their areas made hunting very difficult. [PAR] \u2013 Full Worm Moon \u2013 March As the temperature begins to warm and the ground begins to thaw, earthworm casts appear, heralding the return of the robins. The more northern tribes knew this Moon as the Full Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signaled the end of winter; or the Full Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing at night. The Full Sap Moon, marking the time of tapping maple trees, is another variation. To the settlers, it was also known as the Lenten Moon, and was considered to be the last full Moon of winter. [PAR] \u2013 Full Pink Moon \u2013 April This name came from the herb moss pink, or wild ground phlox, which is one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring. Other names for this month\u2019s celestial body include the Full Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon, and among coastal tribes the Full Fish Moon, because this was the time that the shad swam upstream to spawn. [PAR] \u2013 Full Flower Moon \u2013 May In most areas, flowers are abundant everywhere during this time. Thus, the name of this Moon. Other names include the Full Corn Planting Moon, or the Milk Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Strawberry Moon \u2013 June This name was universal to every Algonquin tribe. However, in Europe they called it the Rose Moon. Also because the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries comes each year during the month of June . . . so the full Moon that occurs during that month was christened for the strawberry! [PAR] \u2013 The Full Buck Moon \u2013 July July is normally the month when the new antlers of buck deer push out of their foreheads in coatings of velvety fur. It was also often called the Full Thunder Moon, for the reason that thunderstorms are most frequent during this time. Another name for this month\u2019s Moon was the Full Hay Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Sturgeon Moon \u2013 August The fishing tribes are given credit for the naming of this Moon, since sturgeon, a large fish of the Great Lakes and other major bodies of water, were most readily caught during this month. A few tribes knew it as the Full Red Moon because, as the Moon rises, it appears reddish through any sultry haze. It was also called",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Henry III of EnglandHenry III (1 October 1207\u00a0\u2013 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death.  The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. [PAR] Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. [PAR] By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX of France recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. [PAR] In 1263 one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised. [PAR] Background and childhood [PAR] Henry was born in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207.  He was the",

The question topic is centered on the impact of the Provisions of Oxford on the reform of the royal government and the expulsion of the Poitevins from England. \n\nTo generate a question, we must first understand the Provisions of Oxford and their significance. The Provisions of Oxford were a set of reforms enacted in 1258 by a coalition of barons, which aimed to reform the royal government and limit the power of the king. This event was a crucial turning point in Henry's reign, as it marked a significant shift in the balance of power between the monarch and the nobility.\n\nThe expulsion of the Poitevins from England was a key aspect of the Provisions of Oxford, as the barons sought to remove the influence of Henry's half-brothers, who were seen as corrupt and oppressive.

Orbits and sizes are not shown to scale. [PAR] Credit: NASA [PAR] Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, kids grew up learning about the nine planets of our solar system. That all changed starting in the late 1990s, when astronomers began to argue about whether Pluto was a planet. In a highly controversial decision , the International Astronomical Union ultimately decided in 2006 to call Pluto a \u201cdwarf planet,\u201d reducing the list of \u201creal planets\u201d in our solar system to eight.\u00a0 [PAR] However, astronomers are now hunting for another planet in our solar system, a true ninth planet , after evidence of its existence was unveiled on Jan. 20, 2016. The so-called \"Planet Nine,\" as scientists are calling it, is about 10 times the mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto. [PAR] [ Solar System Pictures: A Photo Tour ] [PAR] If you insist on including Pluto , then that world would come after Neptune on the list; Pluto is truly way out there, and on a wildly tilted, elliptical orbit (two of the several reasons it got demoted). Interestingly, Pluto used to be the eighth planet, actually. More on that below. [PAR] Terrestrial planets [PAR] The inner four worlds are called \u201c terrestrial planets ,\u201d because, like Earth, their surfaces are all rocky. Pluto, too, has a solid surface (and a very frozen one) but has never been grouped with the four terrestrials. [PAR] Jovian planets [PAR] The four large outer worlds \u2014 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune \u2014 are known as the \u201cJovian planets\u201d (meaning \u201cJupiter-like\u201d) because they are all huge compared to the terrestrial planets, and because they are gaseous in nature rather than having rocky surfaces (though some or all of them may have solid cores, astronomers say). According to NASA , \"two of the outer planets beyond the orbit of Mars \u2014 Jupiter and Saturn \u2014 are known as gas giants; the more distant Uranus and Neptune are called ice giants.\" This is because, while the first two are dominated by gas, while the last two have more ice. All four contain mostly hydrogen and helium. [PAR] Dwarf planets [PAR] The\u00a0 IAU definition of a full-fledged planet goes like this: A body that circles the sun without being some other object's satellite, is large enough to be rounded by its own gravity (but not so big that it begins to undergo nuclear fusion, like a star) and has \"cleared its neighborhood\" of most other orbiting bodies. Yeah, that\u2019s a mouthful. [PAR] The problem for Pluto, besides its small size and offbeat orbit, is that it shares its space with lots of other objects in the Kuiper Belt , beyond Neptune. Still, the demotion of Pluto remains controversial . [PAR] The IAU planet definition puts other small, round worlds in the dwarf planet category, including the Kuiper Belt objects Eris , Haumea , and Makemake . [PAR] Also now a dwarf planet is Ceres , a round object in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was actually considered a planet when discovered in 1801 and then later deemed to be an asteroid. Some astronomers like to consider Ceres as a 10th planet (not to be confused with Nibiru or Planet X ), but that line of thinking opens up the possibility of there being 13 planets, with more bound to be discovered.

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism. [PAR] Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election. [PAR] On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her re-election in 1983. [PAR] Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987. During this period her support for a Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire, which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. After a series of small strokes in 2002, she was advised to withdraw from public speaking. Despite this, she managed to prerecord a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death, which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004.  In 2013, she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87. [PAR] Early life and education [PAR] Thatcher was born Margaret Hilda Roberts on 13 October 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Her father was Alfred Roberts, originally from Northamptonshire, and her mother was Beatrice Ethel (n\u00e9e Stephenson) from Lincolnshire. She spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned two grocery shops. She and her older sister Muriel (1921\u20132004) were raised in the flat above the larger of the two, on North Parade. Her father was active in local politics and the Methodist church, serving as an alderman and a local preacher, and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist  attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church. He came from a Liberal family but stood \u2013 as was then customary in local government \u2013 as an Independent. He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945\u201346 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950. [PAR] Margaret Roberts attended Huntingtower Road Primary School and won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; her extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking. She was head girl in 1942\u201343.  In her upper sixth year she applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, but she was initially rejected and was offered a place only after another candidate withdrew.

The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. [PAR] Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. [PAR] By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX of France recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. [PAR] In 1263 one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290.

The rebuilding of Westminster Abbey was a significant undertaking, reflecting Henry's piety and devotion to Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. The fact that Henry was buried in Westminster Abbey and later moved to his current tomb in 1290 highlights the importance of this location as a symbol of royal power and legitimacy.\n\nFurthermore, the declaration of miracles after Henry's death, although not leading to his canonization, suggests that he was perceived as a pious and virtuous ruler by his contemporaries.

He is a pompous, blustering figure with overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager, and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He believes in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. He is class conscious and a snob, considering himself upper-middle class and looking down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. His pretensions stand in contrast to Wilson , who is genuinely Upper Middle Class, Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's having attending public school, believing it made him 'wet', while his own state-school background is an attribute. Mainwaring and Wilson's relationship is mainly based on the fact that Mainwaring has always had to struggle and fight for everything in his life, whereas Wilson has just sat back and let it all come to him, (despite being a strong autocrat, Mainwaring fully believes that people should work and earn everything they get in life). Mainwaring is prudish and repressed, and can be judgemental about people who do not share his moral outlook. [PAR] Mainwaring [PAR] Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those he considers beneath him, and his arrogance is frequently punctured by circumstance and the people around him, such as Arthur Wilson , his chief clerk with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship, and Private Walker , a black-marketeer who interjects during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefitting from underhanded deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not, and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. [PAR] As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he is barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, and his plans result in chaos. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain of World War I. (In World War II, John Le Mesurier who played Wilson, had been a Captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major). He did, however, serve in the army of occupation in France, \"during the whole of 1919 \u2014 somebody had to clear up the mess.\" (He tried to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight; Arthur Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to World War II but was also rejected with poor eyesight.) [PAR] Despite his shortcomings as a leader, Mainwaring considers himself an excellent military tactician. His height and background is frequently demonstrated to show a Napoleon Complex; he is frequently referred to as 'Napoleon' by his nemesis Hodges . In one episode, A Soldier's Farewell , Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte , and is thwarted at the Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington looking like Wilson. His pomposity and conviction of his prowess see Mainwaring yearn to be in control of any situation, and he behaves in an arrogant manner; this is demonstrated by the first episode, in which he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience or qualifications (and had to wait until the episode Room at the Bottom before he received his commission). [PAR] In Command Decision he was prepared to relinquish control so the platoon could gain rifles, arguing defence of the country was more important than his ego. In addition he was prepared to \"march in the ranks as Private Mainwaring\" when he was briefly de-commissioned. This implied he was more overzealous than a control freak. [PAR] Mainwaring's patriotism can lead to xenophobia (he is not keen on the French because they are emotional, the Russians because their communism, and the Germans and the Italians because of them being such deadly enemies). Mainwaring often refers to Hitler and the Germans as if he is leading his",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a question that probes the domain expert's understanding of how Mainwaring's character challenges or reinforces stereotypes and social norms, we must first analyze the provided context. The context describes Mainwaring as a pompous, blustering figure with an overdeveloped sense of his importance, fueled by his social status as the bank manager and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. It highlights his class consciousness, snobbery, and belief in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. \n\nMainwaring's character reinforces stereotypes of the upper-middle class, particularly in his attitudes towards those he considers beneath him and his pretensions of superiority. However, his background and insecurities, such as struggling to rise above his working-class roots and his jealousy of Wilson's genuine upper-middle-class status and public school education, add complexity to his character. This complexity challenges the simplistic stereotype of the upper-middle class as uniformly privileged and secure in their status.\n\nMoreover, Mainwaring's leadership style and military competence, or lack thereof, challenge traditional norms of military leadership, which often emphasize bravery, strategic thinking, and combat experience. His reliance on those he considers inferior and his frequent dependence on circumstance and the people around him to achieve his goals further complicate the traditional view of a military commander.\n\nThe context also touches on how Mainwaring's character interacts with other social norms, such as patriotism and xenophobia, particularly in his views on the French, Russians, Germans, and Italians. This aspect of his character reinforces certain stereotypes about nationalist or patriotic individuals but also invites a deeper exploration of how these beliefs are intertwined with his class consciousness and military ambitions.\n\nGiven this analysis, a thoughtful and probing question would need to delve into the nuances of how Mainwaring's character both reinforces and challenges these stereotypes and social norms, particularly in the context of class, social status, and military leadership.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does Mainwaring's complex and often contradictory character, marked by both a strong sense of class superiority and deep-seated insecurities, subvert or reinforce traditional stereotypes of military leadership and upper-middle-class identity in the context of wartime Britain?\nExplanation: This question requires the test-taker to consider the multifaceted nature of Mainwaring's character and how it reflects and challenges societal norms and stereotypes.

[PAR] Share this: [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] Author [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] URL [PAR] Google [PAR] August 15, 1914, marks the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Panama Canal, the American-built waterway across the Isthmus of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice. [PAR] In 1902, Congress authorized the purchase of the French assets. However, the following year, when Colombia, which Panama was then a",

[PAR] Three of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer.. [PAR] Prime Meridian [PAR] While the equator divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres , it is the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude and the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian (near the International Date Line ) at 180 degrees longitude that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres . The Eastern Hemisphere consists of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia while the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America . Some geographers place the boundaries between the hemispheres at 20\u00b0 West and 160\u00b0 East so as to not run through Europe and Africa. Unlike the equator and the Tropic of Cancer and",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] MinnesotaMinnesota (; locally ) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The name comes from the Dakota word for \"clear blue water\".  Owing to its large number of lakes, the state is informally known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    [PAR] Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. [PAR] Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non-native inhabitants. A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland. Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many first working in iron mines. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, Somalia, and Latin America has broadened the state's historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota has America's largest Somali population.  Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: Mnisota. The root mni (also spelled mini or minne) means \"water\" and \"t\u014d\" (\"ta\") means \"blue\".  Mnisota can be translated as clear blue water or clouded blue water depending on pronunciation.   Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it mnisota. Many places in the state have similar names, such as Minnehaha Falls (\"laughing water\" (waterfall)), Minneiska (\"white water\"), Minneota (\"much water\"), Minnetonka (\"big water\"), Minnetrista (\"crooked water\"), and Minneapolis, a combination of mni and polis, the Greek word for \"city\".  [PAR] Geography [PAR] Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state is part of the U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north. With ,  or approximately 2.25 percent of the United States,  Minnesota is the 12th-largest state.  [PAR] Geology [PAR] Minnesota contains some of the oldest rocks found on earth, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the primordial ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota.  The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.

[PAR] Background [PAR] Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) was born in the village of Sontsovka in the Donets region of the Ukraine.\u00a0 He was a child prodigy on the order of Mozart, composing for piano at age five and writing an opera at nine.\u00a0 His first teacher was his mother, a talented pianist.\u00a0 He attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory from 1904 to 1914, winning the Anton Rubinstein prize for best student pianist when he graduated.\u00a0 He traveled widely, spending many years in London and Paris, and toured the United States five times. [PAR] In 1936, Prokofiev returned to settle permanently in the Soviet Union.\u00a0 One of his first compositions after his return was Peter and the Wolf, written in just two weeks in April of 1936 for a children's theater in Moscow.\u00a0 Prokofiev invented the story and wrote the narration himself, drawing on memories of his own childhood.\u00a0 He constructed the music as a child's introduction to the orchestra, with each character in the story represented by a different instrument or group of instruments: Peter by the strings, the bird by the flute, the duck by the oboe, the cat by the clarinet, the wolf by the horn section, and so on.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Marilyn MonroeMarilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926\u00a0\u2013 August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult. Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928. The identity",

The tribes kept track of the seasons by giving distinctive names to each recurring full Moon. Their names were applied to the entire month in which each occurred. There was some variation in the Moon names, but in general, the same ones were current throughout the Algonquin tribes from New England to Lake Superior. European settlers followed that custom and created some of their own names. Since the lunar month is only 29 days long on the average, the full Moon dates shift from year to year. Here is the Farmers Almanac\u2019s list of the full Moon names. [PAR] \u2013 Full Wolf Moon \u2013 January Amid the cold and deep snows of midwinter, the wolf packs howled hungrily outside Indian villages. Thus, the name for January\u2019s full Moon. Sometimes it was also referred to as the Old Moon, or the Moon After Yule. Some called it the Full Snow Moon, but most tribes applied that name to the next Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Snow Moon \u2013 February Since the heaviest snow usually falls during this month, native tribes of the north and east most often called February\u2019s full Moon the Full Snow Moon. Some tribes also referred to this Moon as the Full Hunger Moon, since harsh weather conditions in their areas made hunting very difficult. [PAR] \u2013 Full Worm Moon \u2013 March As the temperature begins to warm and the ground begins to thaw, earthworm casts appear, heralding the return of the robins. The more northern tribes knew this Moon as the Full Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signaled the end of winter; or the Full Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing at night. The Full Sap Moon, marking the time of tapping maple trees, is another variation. To the settlers, it was also known as the Lenten Moon, and was considered to be the last full Moon of winter. [PAR] \u2013 Full Pink Moon \u2013 April This name came from the herb moss pink, or wild ground phlox, which is one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring. Other names for this month\u2019s celestial body include the Full Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon, and among coastal tribes the Full Fish Moon, because this was the time that the shad swam upstream to spawn. [PAR] \u2013 Full Flower Moon \u2013 May In most areas, flowers are abundant everywhere during this time. Thus, the name of this Moon. Other names include the Full Corn Planting Moon, or the Milk Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Strawberry Moon \u2013 June This name was universal to every Algonquin tribe. However, in Europe they called it the Rose Moon. Also because the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries comes each year during the month of June . . . so the full Moon that occurs during that month was christened for the strawberry! [PAR] \u2013 The Full Buck Moon \u2013 July July is normally the month when the new antlers of buck deer push out of their foreheads in coatings of velvety fur. It was also often called the Full Thunder Moon, for the reason that thunderstorms are most frequent during this time. Another name for this month\u2019s Moon was the Full Hay Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Sturgeon Moon \u2013 August The fishing tribes are given credit for the naming of this Moon, since sturgeon, a large fish of the Great Lakes and other major bodies of water, were most readily caught during this month.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical noteIn music, the term note has three primary meanings: [PAR] #A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound (\u266a, \u266b); [PAR] #A pitched sound itself. [PAR] #A pitch class. [PAR] Notes are the \"atoms\" of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.  [PAR] The term note can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\".  In the former case, one uses note to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: Key signature names and translations.) [PAR] Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class. [PAR] In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si, including for instance Italy, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details).  [PAR] The eighth note, or octave, is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of scientific pitch notation combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440\u00a0Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4. [PAR] There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the Helmholtz pitch notation and the scientific pitch notation. [PAR] Accidentals  [PAR] Letter names are modified by the accidentals. A sharp  raises a note by a semitone or half-step, and a flat  lowers it by the same amount. In modern tuning a half step has a frequency ratio of \\sqrt[12]{2}, approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F represents F-sharp, B is B-flat. [PAR] Additional accidentals are the double-sharp , raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat , lowering it by that amount. [PAR] In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the key signature, which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the natural symbol , is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G-sharp, a local flat before a G makes it G-flat (not G natural), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat () to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp  sign on a key signature with a single sharp  indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp. [PAR] Assuming enharmonicity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B is equal to the note C. Assuming",

The descendant of Viking raiders, he had been Duke of Normandy since 1035. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son. [PAR] William was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine. [PAR] In the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him, and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent. [PAR] William's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey listing all the landholders in England along with their holdings. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire, but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, Robert, and his second surviving son, William, received England. [PAR] Background  [PAR] Norsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement surrendering the county of Rouen to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy.Collins Early Medieval Europe pp. 376\u2013377 Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 42\u201343 In an effort to improve matters, King \u00c6thelred the Unready took Emma of Normandy, sister of Duke Richard II, as his second wife in 1002.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 54\u201355 [PAR] Danish raids on England continued,",

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village.

[PAR] Leonard Rossiter was born on October 21st, 1926 in Liverpool. Unable to afford to go to university, he worked in an insurance office until he was 27, when he joined Preston repertory company and made his professional stage debut in The Gay Dog. After Preston, he starred in productions at Wolverhampton, Salisbury and The Old Vic Company at Bristol's Theatre Royal. In 1962 he made his first big-screen appearance in A Kind of Loving, followed by other films throughout the 1960s, including Billy Liar, King Rat and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and TV appearances such as Z Cars, The Avengers and Steptoe and Son. His portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the 1969 play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui made him a West End star. His roles as Rigsby in Rising Damp and the title role in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin made him a household name, and his Cinzano commercials with Joan Collins were comic masterpieces. A keen sportsman, he excelled in squash, tennis and football. He was also a connoisseur of fine wines. His busy career came to a tragically premature end on October 5th 1984, just sixteen days short of his 58th birthday. During a performance of Joe Orton's play Loot, Leonard suffered a heart attack in his dressing room. He was married to actress Gillian Raine and had a daughter, Camilla.

That's very Rigsby, but I recognise it from when I grew up.\" [PAR] - \"Of course, the difficulty with comedy series, as I think most people realise, is that the first two are often quite good and then they begin to tail off afterwards. And I reckon that Eric was capable of writing at least six good scripts, so I did the first series without any qualms.

[PAR] In Greek mythology, Pandora (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1)(\"all gifted\") was the first woman, fashioned by Zeus as part of the punishment of mankind for Prometheus ' theft of the secret of fire. [PAR] Hesiod , in his Works and Days, ca. 700 BC, has a very early version of the Pandora story. [ 1 ] [PAR] Creation of Pandora: Zeus, Hermes, Epimetheus and Pandora [PAR] The legend [PAR] The titan Epimetheus (\"hindsight\") was responsible for giving a positive trait to each and every animal. However, when it was time to give man a positive trait, there was nothing left. Prometheus (\"foresight\"), his brother, felt that because man was superior to all other animals, man should have a gift no other animal possessed. So Prometheus set forth to steal fire from Zeus and handed it over to man. [PAR] Zeus was enraged and decided to punish Prometheus and his creation: mankind. To punish Prometheus, Zeus chained him in unbreakable fetters and set an eagle over him to eat his liver each day, as the eagle is Zeus' sacred animal. Prometheus was an immortal, so the liver grew back every day, but he was still tormented daily from the pain, until he was freed by Heracles during The Twelve Labours. [PAR] To punish mankind, Zeus ordered the other gods to make Pandora as a poisoned gift for man. Pandora was given several traits from the different gods: Hephaestus molded her out of clay and gave her form; Athena clothed her and adorned her with necklaces made by Hephaestus as well as taught her manual dexterity and how to spin; Aphrodite gave her beauty; Apollo gave her musical talent and a gift for healing; Demeter taught her to tend a garden; Poseidon gave her a pearl necklace and the ability to never drown; Zeus made her idle, mischievous, and foolish; Hera gave her curiosity; Hermes, along with giving her cunning, boldness and charm, then gave Pandora a box. The name Pandora, thus, derives from the fact she's received gifts from all deities: \"all gifts\". [PAR] Pandora Vase [PAR] Before he was chained to the rock, Prometheus had warned Epimetheus not to take any gifts from the gods. Epimetheus did not listen to his brother, however, and when Pandora arrived, he fell in love with her. Hermes told him that Pandora was a gift to the titan from Zeus, and he warned Epimetheus to not open the box, which was Pandora's dowry. [PAR] Until then, mankind had lived a life in a paradise without worry. Epimetheus told Pandora never to open the box she had received from Zeus. However, one day, Pandora's curiosity got the better of her and she opened it, releasing all the misfortunes of mankind (plague, sorrow, poverty, crime, etc.). Once opened, she shut it in time to keep one thing in the box: hope 1. The world remained extremely bleak for an unspecified interval, until Pandora \"chanced\" to revisit the box again, at which point Hope fluttered out. Thus, mankind always has hope in times of evil, but Hope has a great deal of catching up to do. (See also Garden of Eden.) [PAR] The daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora was Pyrrha , who married Deucalion and was one of the two who survived the deluge. [PAR] Epimetheus and Pandora, El Greco [PAR] Commentary [PAR] The story of Pandora's Box can be interpreted in more than one way, but one obvious moral is that of \"curiosity killed the cat\". [PAR] Some scholars 2 contend that Pandora's \"box\" may have been a mistranslation, and her \"box\" may have been a large jar or vase, forged from the earth. In fact, there is evidence 3 that suggests Pandora herself was the jar. In Ancient Greece jars commonly bore images of women. The jar was said 4 to have been in a jar form because of the similarites between a jar and a woman's uterus. [PAR] The",

[PAR] Diana was born into a family of British nobility with royal ancestry as The Honourable Diana Spencer. She was the fourth child and third daughter of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp and the Honourable Frances Roche. She grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate, and was educated in England and Switzerland. In 1975, after her father inherited the title of Earl Spencer, she became Lady Diana Spencer. [PAR] Her wedding to the Prince of Wales on 29 July 1981, held at St Paul's Cathedral, reached a global television audience of over 750 million people. While married, Diana bore the titles Princess of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay, Countess of Chester, and Baroness of Renfrew. The marriage produced two sons, the princes William and Harry, who were then respectively second and third in the line of succession to the British throne. As Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions overseas. She was celebrated for her charity work and for her support of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. She was involved with dozens of charities including London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for children, of which she was president from 1989.

Media attention and public mourning were extensive after her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 and subsequent televised funeral. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Diana was born on 1 July 1961, in Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk. She was the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924\u20131992) and his first wife, Frances (n\u00e9e Roche; 1936\u20132004). The Spencer family has been closely allied with the British Royal Family for several generations. Both of Diana's grandmothers had served as ladies in waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Spencers were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after her mother and Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford, her distant relative who was also known as \"Lady Diana Spencer\" before marriage and was a prospective Princess of Wales. Diana was baptised at St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham. Diana had three siblings: Sarah, Jane, and Charles. Her infant brother, John, died shortly after his birth one year before Diana was born. The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was reportedly sent to Harley Street clinics in London to determine the cause of the \"problem\". The experience was described as \"humiliating\" by Diana's younger brother, Charles: \"It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it.\" Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate. The Spencers leased the house from its owner, Queen Elizabeth II. The Royal Family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with Princes Andrew and Edward as a child. [PAR] Diana was seven years old when her parents divorced. Her mother later had an affair with Peter Shand Kydd and married him in 1969.

Shortly afterwards he won custody of Diana with support from his former mother-in-law, Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy. In 1972, Lord Althorp began a relationship with Raine, Countess of Dartmouth, the only daughter of Alexander McCorquodale and Dame Barbara Cartland. They married at Caxton Hall, London in 1976.

There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties.

His father Pavel was a shopkeeper the town, which was small, provincial, and on the Sea of Azov in the south of Russia, and his grandfather was Egor Chekhov, a serf. Serfs were the legal property of the landowners who owned the property on which they resided; it was thus a form of slavery. In 1841, Egor bought freedom for himself and his family at the price of 875 rubles. [PAR] Russia had been changing ever since the early 18th century, when Tsar Peter the Great carried out a series of reforms with the intent of modernizing Russia in Western Europe's image. European styles in fashion and art were imported, the Western canon was widely read among the nobility, and French was adopted as the language of cultured discourse. A large government bureaucracy was created; the achievement of rank became an obsession of Russian life. During Chekhov's childhood, in the time of Tsar Alexander II, a second wave of reforms was underway, reforms that further liberalized the country and its economy. The most important of these was the Emancipation Declaration of 1861, which freed the serfs from bondage. These reforms caused great controversy, as they introduced what was, in effect, the beginning of a free-market economy, undermining the power of the nobility, and sometimes even impoverishing them. The situation displayed in The Cherry Orchard, of a wealthy landowning family forced to sell their estate in order to pay their debts, was thus a familiar one in the Russian society of Chekhov's day. [PAR] Chekhov himself had a relatively quiet childhood. He attended the local Russian grammar school, worked in his father's store and occasionally wrote small pieces for the amusement of his family. Taganrog was not a typical provincial town; it was a multicultural port, with Italians, Greeks, and Turks residing in the wealthier sections of town and Russians such as the Chekhovs living in comparatively poor suburbs. It had a theater, which the young Chekhov would often visit. When Chekhov was sixteen, Pavel's store failed, and the entire family had to move to Moscow\u2014the entire family, that is, except for Anton. A merchant (and friend of the family) had helped the Chekhovs with a loan, but insisted on keeping Anton with him in the house as a kind of collateral. As soon as he could, he left Taganrog in order to pursue medical studies in Moscow in 1879 at the age of 19. [PAR] That year, Chekhov began to write comic stories in order to pay his medical school tuition. By the time he was twenty, he was employed by The Spectator magazine as their regular humorist. Over ninety percent of Chekhov's published work appeared in magazines before he was twenty-eight, and, by this age, he had already established himself as a premier writer of short stories. As he developed as a writer, his stories began to take on deeper and more profound themes, as he moved away from his comic roots. [PAR] To this day, Chekhov's literary reputation primarily rests with his short stories, and Chekhov's early plays, written primarily in his early 20s, are not well-remembered. It was only in 1896 that he began to turn his attention back to drama; in the eight remaining years before his death, he managed to complete four plays: The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, The Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard. [PAR] The first performance of The Seagull was nearly laughed off the stage; it was criticized as dull, unimaginative, and lacking any sort of dramatic tension (a critical undercurrent that has survived in Russia to this day). Only gradually did Chekhov's new form of drama, emphasizing characterization, detail and symbolism instead of plot development and incident, gain acceptance. Chekhov was the in-house playwright for the Moscow Arts Theatre, which had been founded by his friend Vladimir Nemirovich-Davchenko. During this time, he fell in love with one of the",

It is the design of the note that tells you its duration, in the same way as the position on the staff tells you the pitch. So each music note on a stave gives  you two pieces of information, pitch and duration. This page focuses on  the duration of each note. [PAR] The Rhythm Tree [PAR] In order to fully understand note lengths become familiar with the rhythm tree. Click here to learn more about the rhythm tree before continuing. The rhythm tree shows how the notes are related to each other. [PAR] Double Whole Note (Breve) [PAR] Although the whole note is the longest note we generally use today, as  is hinted at by the UK name there used be a note called a Breve. This is  known as a Double Whole note in the US. The double whole note (breve)  divides into 2 whole notes (semibreves) following the pattern of the  other notes in the Rhythm Tree. The Double Whole note (Breve) is  therefore worth 8 quarter notes (crotchets). The Double Whole note  (Breve) fell out of use as smaller value notes were invented by  composers. It can be notated as an open rectangle or a whole note with  bars either side. Click here to read more about the double whole note (breve) and how our modern system of music notation developed. Make sure you  have a few spare moments though as once you start reading the history of  the music note it's difficult to stop! [PAR] Whole Note (Semibreve) [PAR] The Whole note is the longest music note in general use today. It is an  open note with no stem. I always say to my students it looks like a  hole\u2026so it is easy to remember! The duration of the whole note is 4  quarter notes. [PAR] Half Note (Minim) [PAR] The Half note duration is 2 quarter notes. It differs from the whole  note in that it has a stem, although it is still open. For students I  liken this stem to the line in the middle of the \u00bd. This also helps them  remember that 1 half note is worth 2 beats (in 4/4 timing, which is  what they are usually working in when learning this). [PAR] Quarter Note (Crotchet) [PAR] The quarter note has become the  de facto standard 1 beat music note.  This has happened as the 4/4 time signature is the most popular (with  3/4 and 2/4 following close behind) and quarter notes have a duration of  1 in these time signatures. It is also roughly in the middle of the  most used notes in the Rhythm Tree ,  making the quarter note the ideal candidate for ensuring whole notes  don't become too long to count, and shorter, popular notes such as  eighth and sixteenth notes aren't impossible to count in terms of them  being fractions of a note. The quarter note changes from the half note  as it is filled in, as opposed to empty. [PAR] Eighth Note (Quaver) [PAR] The eighth note is worth \u00bd of a Quarter note. It may also be considered  as a one beat note in 3/8 and similar timings, the 8 on the bottom of  the time signature giving the clue that you are counting in eighth  notes. This is the first note in the rhythm tree to have a flag.  The flag is the name for the 'tail' added to the eighth note. Eighth  notes may be a single as shown on the left, or joined together with beams. [PAR] It is common to see eighth notes joined into sets of 2 to make one beat.  Eighth notes may also be grouped in 3s, 4s, 5s, or even 6s depending on  the time signature.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical noteIn music, the term note has three primary meanings: [PAR] #A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound (\u266a, \u266b); [PAR] #A pitched sound itself. [PAR] #A pitch class. [PAR] Notes are the \"atoms\" of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.  [PAR] The term note can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\".  In the former case, one uses note to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: Key signature names and translations.) [PAR] Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class. [PAR] In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si, including for instance Italy, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details).  [PAR] The eighth note, or octave, is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of scientific pitch notation combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440\u00a0Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4. [PAR] There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the Helmholtz pitch notation and the scientific pitch notation. [PAR] Accidentals  [PAR] Letter names are modified by the accidentals. A sharp  raises a note by a semitone or half-step, and a flat  lowers it by the same amount. In modern tuning a half step has a frequency ratio of \\sqrt[12]{2}, approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F represents F-sharp, B is B-flat. [PAR] Additional accidentals are the double-sharp , raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat , lowering it by that amount. [PAR] In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the key signature, which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the natural symbol , is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G-sharp, a local flat before a G makes it G-flat (not G natural), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat () to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp  sign on a key signature with a single sharp  indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp. [PAR] Assuming enharmonicity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B is equal to the note C. Assuming",

[PAR] In Greek mythology, Pandora (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1)(\"all gifted\") was the first woman, fashioned by Zeus as part of the punishment of mankind for Prometheus ' theft of the secret of fire. [PAR] Hesiod , in his Works and Days, ca. 700 BC, has a very early version of the Pandora story. [ 1 ] [PAR] Creation of Pandora: Zeus, Hermes, Epimetheus and Pandora [PAR] The legend [PAR] The titan Epimetheus (\"hindsight\") was responsible for giving a positive trait to each and every animal. However, when it was time to give man a positive trait, there was nothing left. Prometheus (\"foresight\"), his brother, felt that because man was superior to all other animals, man should have a gift no other animal possessed. So Prometheus set forth to steal fire from Zeus and handed it over to man. [PAR] Zeus was enraged and decided to punish Prometheus and his creation: mankind. To punish Prometheus, Zeus chained him in unbreakable fetters and set an eagle over him to eat his liver each day, as the eagle is Zeus' sacred animal. Prometheus was an immortal, so the liver grew back every day, but he was still tormented daily from the pain, until he was freed by Heracles during The Twelve Labours. [PAR] To punish mankind, Zeus ordered the other gods to make Pandora as a poisoned gift for man. Pandora was given several traits from the different gods: Hephaestus molded her out of clay and gave her form; Athena clothed her and adorned her with necklaces made by Hephaestus as well as taught her manual dexterity and how to spin; Aphrodite gave her beauty; Apollo gave her musical talent and a gift for healing; Demeter taught her to tend a garden; Poseidon gave her a pearl necklace and the ability to never drown; Zeus made her idle, mischievous, and foolish; Hera gave her curiosity; Hermes, along with giving her cunning, boldness and charm, then gave Pandora a box. The name Pandora, thus, derives from the fact she's received gifts from all deities: \"all gifts\". [PAR] Pandora Vase [PAR] Before he was chained to the rock, Prometheus had warned Epimetheus not to take any gifts from the gods. Epimetheus did not listen to his brother, however, and when Pandora arrived, he fell in love with her. Hermes told him that Pandora was a gift to the titan from Zeus, and he warned Epimetheus to not open the box, which was Pandora's dowry. [PAR] Until then, mankind had lived a life in a paradise without worry. Epimetheus told Pandora never to open the box she had received from Zeus. However, one day, Pandora's curiosity got the better of her and she opened it, releasing all the misfortunes of mankind (plague, sorrow, poverty, crime, etc.). Once opened, she shut it in time to keep one thing in the box: hope 1. The world remained extremely bleak for an unspecified interval, until Pandora \"chanced\" to revisit the box again, at which point Hope fluttered out. Thus, mankind always has hope in times of evil, but Hope has a great deal of catching up to do. (See also Garden of Eden.)

[PAR] You are here: Home / Bible Q&A / Q&A Archive / What is the relationship of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam? [PAR] Bible Question: [PAR] It sounds as if Moses was the first born son according to Exodus 2:1-2, but then in Exodus 6:20 it lists Aaron and then Moses as brothers. Aaron is listed first so he would be the oldest. Where was Aaron when Moses was put in the basket by his mother? Did Moses and Aaron have the same parents? The Bible also mentions Miriam as Aaron's sister (Exodus 15:20) but why not Moses as well? Could you explain the family relationship of these three? [PAR] Bible Answer: [PAR] The three passages you refer to are presented below. [PAR] Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months. (NASB) Exodus 2:1-2 [PAR] And Amram married his father\u2019s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram\u2019s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. (NASB) Exodus 6:20 [PAR] And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron\u2019s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.Ex. 15:20 [PAR] First, we want to notice that the Bible does not provide any details about Aaron in the account of Moses in the basket (Exodus 2). Scripture never tries to give us all of the details because it is more interested in sending us a message. In both of the passages above, we are told that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam are the children of one father. His name was Amram. He was a Levite. [PAR] Other Proof? There are two other passages in the Old Testament that clearly tell us these three are brothers and a sister. The first passage is found in Numbers 26 and the second one is found in 1 Chronicles. [PAR] And the name of Amram\u2019s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. (NASB) Numbers 26:59 [PAR] And the children of Amram were Aaron, Moses, and Miriam . . . (NASB) 1 Chronicles 6:3 [PAR] The first passage says that their father was named Amram and their mother was Jochebed. From Exodus 2:1 we discovered that Amram was a Levite and from Numbers 26 we discover that Jochebed was a Levite too! Together Amram and Jochebed had two sons named Aaron and Moses and one daughter named Miriam. The second passage confirms the statement of the first one. [PAR] Moses and Aaron. From both of those passages, we discover that Aaron was the older brother, since he was listed first in each geneaology. It was customary in the Old Testament to list the first born son first. This is great news. God is more concerned about the heart of a person than about their lineage. I wonder how Moses felt when God told him that he was going to let his older brother speak for him, and how Aaron felt when Moses became the leader of Israel. [PAR] Conclusion: [PAR] The answer to that first question may be found in this verse, [PAR] Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth. (NASB) Numbers 12:3 [PAR] Moses was a very humble man. I believe that Moses did not react negatively to his brother\u2019s speaking for God before Moses. What a wonderful example to us. God calls us to serve Him and not worry about the other person. Praise the Lord.

The provided text clarifies that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam are siblings, with Aaron being the older brother, as indicated by the genealogical listings in Exodus 6:20, Numbers 26:59, and 1 Chronicles 6:3. Their father, Amram, and their mother, Jochebed, were both from the tribe of Levi, emphasizing their lineage within the Levitical priesthood.\n\nThe biblical portrayal of these siblings offers insights into the values of family, leadership, and service to God. Moses, as the leader of the Israelites, demonstrates humility (Numbers 12:3) and obedience to God's will, even when it involves his brother Aaron speaking on his behalf. Aaron, as the high priest, represents the priestly lineage and the importance of ritual and spiritual leadership. Miriam, identified as a prophetess (Exodus 15:20), signifies the role of women in spiritual leadership and prophecy.\n\nThe dynamic between Moses, Aaron, and Miriam provides a model for contemporary understanding and application of family, leadership, and service values. It highlights the importance of humility in leadership, the value of diverse roles within a community (including spiritual, prophetic, and priestly roles), and the significance of family and lineage in biblical tradition. Furthermore, their stories illustrate how God can use anyone, regardless of birth order or societal expectations, for significant purposes.\n\nGiven the complexity and depth of these themes, the question should invite reflection on how the biblical portrayal of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam informs our understanding of these values and how they can be applied in contemporary contexts.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does the biblical narrative of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam exemplify the intersection of family dynamics, divine calling, and leadership roles, and what implications does this have for modern concepts of service, humility, and spiritual authority?\nExplanation: The question requires an understanding of the biblical text's portrayal of the siblings' relationships and roles, as well as the ability to apply these insights to contemporary values and practices.

Dickens and his illustrator Hablot Browne        (phiz) traveled incognito to Yorkshire on a fact-finding mission in        January 1838. There they encountered William Shaw, headmaster of Bowes Academy,        in whose school several boys had died or went blind from mistreatment and        neglect. [PAR] Visiting a cemetery in the area Dickens found the graves of many of the        students of these schools and one in particular Dickens said \"put Smike        into my head\". Smike was the abused inmate of Dotheboys Hall, the fictional        school he based on Shaw's Bowes Academy in Nicholas Nickleby.

[PAR] In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.

[PAR] The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558\u20131603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World.

Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the  execution of Charles I in 1649.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010.

Although Lemuel Gulliver\u2019s vivid and detailed style of narration makes it clear that he is intelligent and well educated, his perceptions are na\u00efve and gullible. He has virtually no emotional life, or at least no awareness of it, and his comments are strictly factual. Indeed, sometimes his obsession with the facts of navigation, for example, becomes unbearable for us, as his fictional editor, Richard Sympson, makes clear when he explains having had to cut out nearly half of Gulliver\u2019s verbiage. Gulliver never thinks that the absurdities he encounters are funny and never makes the satiric connections between the lands he visits and his own home. Gulliver\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 makes the satire possible, as we pick up on things that Gulliver does not notice. [PAR] Read an in-depth analysis of Gulliver. [PAR] The emperor\u00a0-\u00a0 The ruler of Lilliput. Like all Lilliputians, the emperor is fewer than six inches tall. His power and majesty impress Gulliver deeply, but to us he appears both laughable and sinister. Because of his tiny size, his belief that he can control Gulliver seems silly, but his willingness to execute his subjects for minor reasons of politics or honor gives him a frightening aspect. He is proud of possessing the tallest trees and biggest palace in the kingdom, but he is also quite hospitable, spending a fortune on his captive\u2019s food. The emperor is both a satire of the autocratic ruler and a strangely serious portrait of political power. [PAR] The farmer\u00a0-\u00a0 Gulliver\u2019s first master in Brobdingnag. The farmer speaks to Gulliver, showing that he is willing to believe that the relatively tiny Gulliver may be as rational as he himself is, and treats him with gentleness. However, the farmer puts Gulliver on display around Brobdingnag, which clearly shows that he would rather profit from his discovery than converse with him as an equal. His exploitation of Gulliver as a laborer, which nearly starves Gulliver to death, seems less cruel than simpleminded. Generally, the farmer represents the average Brobdingnagian of no great gifts or intelligence, wielding an extraordinary power over Gulliver simply by virtue of his immense size. [PAR] Glumdalclitch\u00a0-\u00a0 The farmer\u2019s nine-year-old daughter, who is forty feet tall. Glumdalclitch becomes Gulliver\u2019s friend and nursemaid, hanging him to sleep safely in her closet at night and teaching him the Brobdingnagian language by day. She is skilled at sewing and makes Gulliver several sets of new clothes, taking delight in dressing him. When the queen discovers that no one at court is suited to care for Gulliver, she invites Glumdalclitch to live at court as his sole babysitter, a function she performs with great seriousness and attentiveness. To Glumdalclitch, Gulliver is basically a living doll, symbolizing the general status Gulliver has in Brobdingnag. [PAR] The queen\u00a0-\u00a0 The queen of Brobdingnag, who is so delighted by Gulliver\u2019s beauty and charms that she agrees to buy him from the farmer for 1,000 pieces of gold. Gulliver appreciates her kindness after the hardships he suffers at the farmer\u2019s and shows his usual fawning love for royalty by kissing the tip of her little finger when presented before her. She possesses, in Gulliver\u2019s words, \u201cinfinite\u201d wit and humor, though this description may entail a bit of Gulliver\u2019s characteristic flattery of superiors. The queen seems genuinely considerate, asking Gulliver whether he would consent to live at court instead of simply taking him in as a pet and inquiring into the reasons for his cold good-byes with the farmer. She is by no means a hero, but simply a pleasant, powerful person. [PAR] The king\u00a0-\u00a0 The king of Brobdingnag, who, in contrast to the emperor of Lilliput, seems to be a true intellectual, well versed in political science among other disciplines. While his wife has an intimate, friendly relationship with the diminutive visitor, the king\u2019s relation to Gulliver is limited to serious discussions about the history and institutions of Gulliver\u2019s native land.",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a question that probes the domain expert's understanding of Glumdalclitch's relationship with Gulliver and its significance, we must first analyze the context provided. The character of Glumdalclitch, the farmer's nine-year-old daughter, is pivotal in understanding Gulliver's experiences in Brobdingnag. Her role as Gulliver's friend, nursemaid, and caretaker, as well as her actions such as teaching him the Brobdingnagian language, making him clothes, and taking delight in dressing him, indicate a complex dynamic. This relationship can be seen as a form of care but also as a form of objectification, where Gulliver is treated like a living doll. The fact that she is tasked with his care at the court, symbolizes the general status Gulliver has in Brobdingnag - that of a curiosity, an object of fascination, and an \"other\" to be cared for but also exploited for entertainment and educational purposes.\n\nThe significance of this relationship lies in its representation of themes such as care, exploitation, and objectification. Glumdalclitch's actions towards Gulliver, while seemingly innocent and kind, also underscore the power dynamics at play. Her size and Gulliver's miniature state create an inherent imbalance, where Gulliver is at her mercy, dependent on her for survival and comfort. This dynamic mirrors the broader themes of the novel, where Swift critiques societal norms, political power, and the treatment of those perceived as different or inferior.\n\nGiven the complexity of this relationship and its thematic significance, a question that encourages deep reflection and insight into these dynamics would be appropriate. The question should challenge the domain expert to consider the multifaceted nature of Glumdalclitch and Gulliver's interaction, the societal commentary it provides, and the psychological implications of being treated as an object or a curiosity.\n\nThe difficulty level of such a question should be high (8-10), requiring the domain expert to synthesize information, recognize subtle themes, and apply critical thinking to understand the nuances of the relationship and its broader implications.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does Glumdalclitch's treatment of Gulliver as a living doll reflect the societal attitudes towards the \"other\" in Brobdingnag, and what commentary does this provide on the human condition in Swift's satire?\nExplanation: This question requires the domain expert to analyze the relationship between Glumdalclitch and Gulliver, recognizing it as a form of objectification that reflects the societal attitudes in Brobdingnag. The expert must then connect this dynamic to the broader themes of Swift's satire, understanding how it comments on the human condition, particularly in regards to how societies treat those perceived as different or inferior.\nCorrect Answer: It symbolizes the objectification and exploitation of the \"other,\" serving as a commentary on the dangers of dehumanization and the absurdities of societal hierarchies.\n</output_format>",

[PAR] The Gold Cup is the highlight of the Cheltenham festival. To win it once is an outstanding achievement. To win it more than once guarantees horse racing immortality. [PAR] Here are the 7 greatest ever Cheltenham Gold Cup horses. [PAR] 7. Easter Hero - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Easter Hero is often referred to as one of the greatest horses to never win the Grand National, where it was disappointed on three occasions, but it did twice taste victory at the Gold Cup. [PAR] In 1929 and again in 1930, Easter Hero won the Gold Cup by more than twenty lengths. Despite never winning the National, many experts think that Easter Hero was the greatest steeplechaser before Arkle came along. [PAR] 6. L'Escargot - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Though most famous for beating Red Rum in the 1975 Grand National, L'Escargot had already made his name by twice winning the Gold Cup, in 1970 and 1971. [PAR] L'Escargot's first Gold Cup victory in 1970 was notable for the fact that it started as a 33/1 outsider. Only the 100/1 winner Norton's Coin has ever won a Gold Cup at longer odds. [PAR] 5. Kauto Star - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] The French-bred Kauto Star is the only horse to have regained a Gold Cup and has also the only horse to win the King George VI Chase four consecutive times. [PAR] Having won the Gold Cup as favourite in 2007, Kauto Star was beaten by his stablemate Denman in 2008. The Paul Nicholls horse bounced back to regain the Gold Cup in 2009, as he defeated Denman by 13 lengths, with a run described by Timeform as: \"Arguably the best performance in the race since Arkle.\" [PAR] 4. Cottage Rake - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Cottage Rake was failed by a vet on three separate examinations, before embarking on a jumping career in which the horse won three Cheltenham Gold Cups. [PAR] Consecutive victories in 1948,1949 and 1950 saw Cottage Rake become only the second horse to win the Gold Cup three times in a row. After his third victory, Cottage Rake completely lost form, but had already done enough to write it's name into the history books. [PAR] 3. Best Mate - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Best Mate won three consecutive Gold Cups between 2002 and 2004. It is possible that the horse and jockey Jim Culloty would have gone on to eclipse the legendary Arkle and win a fourth Gold Cup, but Best Mate pulled out of the race in 2005 having burst a blood vessel just eight days before the race. [PAR] That same year, Best Mate hit the front pages, after he suffered a heart attack and died while racing at Exeter. Best Mate's ashes were buried beside the winning post at Cheltenham, where he had enjoyed so many triumphs. [PAR] 2. Arkle - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Arkle won the Gold Cup in 1964, 1965 and 1966. Such was Arkle's dominance at the time, that it is likely that he would have gone on to win the race again, but a fractured pedal bone saw the horse put out for retirement. [PAR] At 212, Arkle's Timeform rating is still the highest ever awarded to a steeplechaser (Kauto Star is the joint third highest ever on 191). Arkle also holds the record of being the shortest priced favourite in any Gold Cup, having triumphed in 1966 at 1/10. [PAR] 1. Golden Miller - 5 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] The most successful Gold Cup horse of all time was Golden Miller, who won the race five times consecutively between 1932 and 1936. As there was no Gold Cup staged in either 1931 or 1937, it's possible that the thoroughbred could have had an even better record. [PAR] As well as having won more Gold Cups than any other horse, Golden Miller also remains the only horse to have won the Cheltenham classic and the Grand National in the",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] NATOThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO; ; '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4\u00a0April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22\u00a0countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15\u00a0other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70 percent of the global total.  Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2 percent of GDP. [PAR] NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion\u2014doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the organization was drawn into the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004. [PAR] Article\u00a05 of the North Atlantic treaty, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks,  after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations  and in 2011 enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. The less potent Article 4, which merely invokes consultation among NATO members, has been invoked five times: by Turkey in 2003 over the Iraq War; twice in 2012 by Turkey over the Syrian Civil War, after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F-4 reconnaissance jet, and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria;  in 2014 by Poland, following the Russian intervention in Crimea;  and again by Turkey in 2015 after threats by the Islamic State to its territorial integrity.  [PAR] History  [PAR] Beginnings  [PAR] The Treaty of Brussels, signed on 17\u00a0March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. The treaty and the Soviet Berlin Blockade led to the creation of the Western European Union's Defence Organization in September 1948. However, participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the military power of the USSR and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism, so talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately resulting in the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4\u00a0April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was \"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.\" Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949. The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called Atlanticism which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Winter Olympic GamesThe Winter Olympic Games (French: Jeux olympiques d'hiver) is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practiced on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating  and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994. [PAR] The Winter Games have evolved since its inception. Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program. Others (such as curling and bobsleigh) have been discontinued and later reintroduced, or have been permanently discontinued (such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it). Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games. It created an income stream, via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to showcase the claimed superiority of their political systems. [PAR] The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries. The United States has hosted the Games four times (1932, 1960, 1980, 2002); France has been the host three times (1924, 1968, 1992);  Austria (1964, 1976), Canada (1988, 2010), Japan (1972, 1998), Italy (1956, 2006), Norway (1952, 1994), and Switzerland (1928, 1948) have hosted the Games twice. Germany (1936), Yugoslavia (1984), and Russia (2014) have hosted the Games once. The IOC has selected Pyeongchang, South Korea, to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing, China, to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. No country in the southern hemisphere has hosted or even been an applicant to host the Winter Olympics; the major challenge preventing one hosting the games is the dependence on winter weather, and the traditional February timing of the games falls in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Prime Minister of CanadaThe Prime Minister of Canada () is the primary minister of the Crown, chairman of the Cabinet, and thus head of government for Canada, charged with advising the Canadian monarch or federal viceroy on the exercise of the executive powers vested in them by the constitution.  Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists only as per long-established convention (originating in Canada's former colonial power, the United Kingdom) that stipulates the monarch's representative, the governor general, must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable (), a privilege maintained for life. [PAR] The current, and 23rd, Prime Minister of Canada is the Liberal Party's Justin Trudeau, who was appointed on November 4, 2015, by Governor General David Johnston, following the general election that took place that year. [PAR] Origin of the office [PAR] The position of prime minister is not outlined in any Canadian constitutional document and is mentioned only in passing in the Constitution Act, 1982,   and the Letters Patent, 1947 issued by King George VI.  The office and its functions are instead governed by constitutional conventions and modelled on the same office in the United Kingdom. [PAR] Qualifications and selection [PAR] The prime minister, along with the other ministers in cabinet, is appointed by the governor general on behalf of the monarch. However, by the conventions of responsible government, designed to maintain administrative stability, the viceroy will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support, or confidence, of a majority of the directly-elected members of the House of Commons;  as a practical matter, this is often the leader of a party whose members form a majority, or a very large plurality, of Members of Parliament (MPs).  There are no age or citizenship restrictions on the position of prime minister itself. [PAR] While there is no legal requirement for the prime minister to be a member of parliament, for practical and political reasons the prime minister is expected to win a seat very promptly.  However, in rare circumstances individuals who are not sitting members of the House of Commons have been appointed to the position of prime minister. Two former prime ministers\u2014Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell\u2014served in the 1890s while members of the Senate. Both, in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate, succeeded prime ministers who had died in office\u2014John A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894. That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario. [PAR] Prime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible.  For example, William Lyon Mackenzie King, after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election (that his party won), briefly \"governed from the hallway\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power. Turner was the last sitting prime minister to not hold a commons seat. [PAR] Should a sitting prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature, or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat, the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by-election. A safe seat is usually chosen; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party's new leader in the by-election, the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention. However, if the governing party selects a new",

[PAR] Leonard Rossiter was born on October 21st, 1926 in Liverpool. Unable to afford to go to university, he worked in an insurance office until he was 27, when he joined Preston repertory company and made his professional stage debut in The Gay Dog. After Preston, he starred in productions at Wolverhampton, Salisbury and The Old Vic Company at Bristol's Theatre Royal. In 1962 he made his first big-screen appearance in A Kind of Loving, followed by other films throughout the 1960s, including Billy Liar, King Rat and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and TV appearances such as Z Cars, The Avengers and Steptoe and Son. His portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the 1969 play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui made him a West End star. His roles as Rigsby in Rising Damp and the title role in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin made him a household name, and his Cinzano commercials with Joan Collins were comic masterpieces. A keen sportsman, he excelled in squash, tennis and football. He was also a connoisseur of fine wines. His busy career came to a tragically premature end on October 5th 1984, just sixteen days short of his 58th birthday. During a performance of Joe Orton's play Loot, Leonard suffered a heart attack in his dressing room. He was married to actress Gillian Raine and had a daughter, Camilla.

[PAR] The feces of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish;[http://archive.today/20120908081151/http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm Spraint Analysis]. ottersite.btinternet.co.uk these are known as spraints.  [PAR] Life cycle [PAR] The gestation period in otters is about 60 to 86 days.  The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog and older offspring.  Bitch otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years.  The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland.  It is lined with moss and grass. [PAR] After one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim.  The pup lives with its family for approximately one year.  Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups.  Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds. [PAR] Characteristics [PAR] Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from  in length and 1 to in weight. The Oriental small-clawed otter is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water. [PAR] Several otter species live in cold waters and have high metabolic rates to help keep them warm. European otters must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and sea otters 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as 10 \u00b0C, an otter needs to catch 100 g of fish per hour to survive. Most species hunt for three to five hours each day and nursing mothers up to eight hours each day. [PAR] For most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, crayfish and crabs.  Some otters are expert at opening shellfish, and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of clams, sea urchins and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their stomachs. This skill must be learned by the young.  [PAR] Otters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic and live in the ocean for most of their lives. [PAR] Otters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity. [PAR] Description [PAR] The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe  in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),   along with tiny traces of",

[PAR] How many books are in the Bible? [PAR] The Bible contains 66 books, divided among the Old and New Testaments. [PAR] How many books are in the Old Testament? [PAR] There are 39 books in the Old Testament. [PAR] How many books are in the New Testament? [PAR] There are 27 books in the New Testament. [PAR] What does \"testament\" mean? [PAR] Testament means \"covenant\" or \"contract.\" [PAR] Who wrote the Bible? [PAR] The Bible was written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit by over 40 different authors from all walks of life: shepherds, farmers, tent-makers, physicians, fishermen, priests, philosophers and kings. Despite these differences in occupation and the span of years it took to write it, the Bible is an extremely cohesive and unified book. [PAR] Which single author contributed the most books to the Old Testament? [PAR] Moses. He wrote the first five books of the Bible, referred to as the Pentateuch; the foundation of the Bible. [PAR] Which single author contributed the most books to the New Testament? [PAR] The Apostle Paul, who wrote 14 books (over half) of the New Testament. [PAR] When was the Bible written? [PAR] It was written over a period of some 1,500 years, from around 1450 B.C. (the time of Moses) to about 100 A.D. (following the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ). [PAR] What is the oldest book in the Old Testament? [PAR] Many scholars agree that Job is the oldest book in the Bible, written by an unknown Israelite about 1500 B.C. Others hold that the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible) are the oldest books in the Bible, written between 1446 and 1406 B.C. [PAR] What is the youngest book in the Old Testament? [PAR] The book of Malachi, written about 400 B.C. [PAR] What is the oldest book of the New Testament? [PAR] Probably the book of James, written as early as A.D. 45. [PAR] What is the youngest book in the New Testament? [PAR] The Book of Revelation is the youngest book of the New Testament, written about 95 A.D. [PAR] What languages was the Bible written in? [PAR] The Bible was written in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. [PAR] When was the Bible canonized? [PAR] The entire New Testament as we know it today, was canonized before the year 375 A.D. The Old Testament had previously been canonized long before the advent of Christ. [PAR] What does \"canon\" mean? [PAR] \"Canon\" is derived front the Greek word \"Kanon,\" signifying a measuring rod. Thus, to have the Bible \"canonized\" meant that it had been measured by the standard or test of divine inspiration and authority. It became the collection of books or writings accepted by the apostles and leadership of the early Christian church as a basis for Christian belief. It is the standard by which all Christians throughout the ages live and worship. [PAR] When was the first translation of the Bible made into English? [PAR] 1382 A.D., by John Wycliffe.

During the flight, the 27-year-old test pilot and industrial technician also became the first man to orbit the planet, a feat accomplished by his space capsule in 89 minutes. Vostok 1 orbited Earth at a maximum altitude of 187 miles and was guided entirely by an automatic control system. The only statement attributed to Gagarin during his one hour and 48 minutes in space was, \u201cFlight is proceeding normally; I am well.\u201d [PAR] After his historic feat was announced, the attractive and unassuming Gagarin became an instant worldwide celebrity. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and given the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Monuments were raised to him across the Soviet Union and streets renamed in his honor. [PAR] The triumph of the Soviet space program in putting the first man into space was a great blow to the United States, which had scheduled its first space flight for May 1961. Moreover, Gagarin had orbited Earth, a feat that eluded the U.S. space program until February 1962, when astronaut John Glenn made three orbits in Friendship 7. By that time, the Soviet Union had already made another leap ahead in the \u201cspace race\u201d with the August 1961 flight of cosmonaut Gherman Titov in Vostok 2. Titov made 17 orbits and spent more than 25 hours in space. [PAR] To Soviet propagandists, the Soviet conquest of space was evidence of the supremacy of communism over capitalism. However, to those who worked on the Vostok program and earlier on Sputnik (which launched the first satellite into space in 1957), the successes were attributable chiefly to the brilliance of one man: Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. Because of his controversial past, Chief Designer Korolev was unknown in the West and to all but insiders in the USSR until his death in 1966. [PAR] Born in the Ukraine in 1906, Korolev was part of a scientific team that launched the first Soviet liquid-fueled rocket in 1933. In 1938, his military sponsor fell prey to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s purges, and Korolev and his colleagues were also put on trial. Convicted of treason and sabotage, Korolev was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp. The Soviet authorities came to fear German rocket advances, however, and after only a year Korolev was put in charge of a prison design bureau and ordered to continue his rocketry work. [PAR] In 1945, Korolev was sent to Germany to learn about the V-2 rocket, which had been used to devastating effect by the Nazis against the British. The Americans had captured the rocket\u2019s designer, Wernher von Braun, who later became head of the U.S. space program, but the Soviets acquired a fair amount of V-2 resources, including rockets, launch facilities, blueprints, and a few German V-2 technicians. By employing this technology and his own considerable engineering talents, by 1954 Korolev had built a rocket that could carry a five-ton nuclear warhead and in 1957 launched the first intercontinental ballistic missile. [PAR] That year, Korolev\u2019s plan to launch a satellite into space was approved, and on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 was fired into Earth\u2019s orbit. It was the first Soviet victory of the space race, and Korolev, still technically a prisoner, was officially rehabilitated. The Soviet space program under Korolev would go on to numerous space firsts in the late 1950s and early \u201960s: first animal in orbit, first large scientific satellite, first man, first woman, first three men, first space walk, first spacecraft to impact the moon, first to orbit the moon, first to impact Venus, and first craft to soft-land on the moon. Throughout this time, Korolev remained anonymous, known only as the \u201cChief Designer.\u201d His dream of sending cosmonauts to the moon eventually ended in failure, primarily because the Soviet lunar program received just one-tenth the funding allocated to America\u2019s successful Apollo lunar landing",

The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  [PAR] Languages [PAR] A national anthem is usually in the national or most common language of the country, whether de facto or official, there are notable exceptions. Most commonly, states with more than one national language may offer several versions of their anthem, for instance: [PAR] *The Swiss Psalm, the national anthem of Switzerland, has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages (French, German, Italian and Romansh). [PAR] *The anthem of Canada, O Canada, has official lyrics in both English and French, and is frequently sung with a mixture of stanzas in both languages, representing the country's bilingual nature. [PAR] *Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann, the anthem of the Republic of Ireland, was written in English, but an Irish translation, although never formally adopted, is now almost always sung. [PAR] *The current national anthem of South Africa is unique in that five of the country's eleven official languages are used in the same anthem (the first stanza is divided between two languages, with each of the remaining three stanzas in a different language). [PAR] *One of the two official national anthems of New Zealand, God Defend New Zealand, is now traditionally sung with the first verse in M\u0101ori (Aotearoa) and the second in English (God Defend New Zealand). The tune is the same but the words are not a direct translation of each other. Similarly, God Bless Fiji has lyrics in English and Fijian which are not translations of each other. [PAR] *There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their anthems. One of these is the Marcha Real, the anthem of Spain. In 2007 a national competition to write words was held, but no lyrics were chosen.  Other anthems with no words include Inno Nazionale della Repubblica, the anthem of San Marino, and that of Kosovo, entitled Europe.

The descendant of Viking raiders, he had been Duke of Normandy since 1035. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son. [PAR] William was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine. [PAR] In the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him, and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent. [PAR] William's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey listing all the landholders in England along with their holdings. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire, but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, Robert, and his second surviving son, William, received England. [PAR] Background  [PAR] Norsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement surrendering the county of Rouen to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy.Collins Early Medieval Europe pp. 376\u2013377 Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 42\u201343 In an effort to improve matters, King \u00c6thelred the Unready took Emma of Normandy, sister of Duke Richard II, as his second wife in 1002.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 54\u201355 [PAR] Danish raids on England continued,",

It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet,[http://www.arcalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Near-Eastern-Chronology-and-the-development-of-the-Greek-Alphabet.pdf The Development of the Greek Alphabet within the Chronology of the ANE] (2009), Quote: \"Naveh gives four major reasons why it is universally agreed that the Greek alphabet was developed from an early Phoenician alphabet.1 According to Herodutous \u201cthe Phoenicians who came with Cadmus... brought into Hellas the alphabet, which had hitherto been unknown, as I think, to the Greeks.\u201d2 The Greek Letters, alpha, beta, gimmel have no meaning in Greek but the meaning of most of their Semitic equivalents is known. For example, \u2018aleph\u2019 means \u2018ox\u2019, \u2018bet\u2019 means \u2018house\u2019 and \u2018gimmel\u2019 means \u2018throw stick\u2019.3 Early Greek letters are very similar and sometimes identical to the West Semitic letters.4 The letter sequence between the Semitic and Greek alphabets is identical. (Naveh 1982)\" and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. [PAR] In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era. [PAR] Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the 5th century BC and today. Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics. The traditional orthography, which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek, has many diacritics, such as accent marks for pitch accent (\"polytonic\"), the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial sound, and the iota subscript for the final historical sound. In standard Modern Greek spelling, orthography has been simplified to the monotonic system, which uses only two diacritics: the acute accent and diaeresis. [PAR] Letters  [PAR] Sound values  [PAR] In both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable. Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic. For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages.  [PAR] Among consonant letters, all letters that denoted voiced plosive consonants (/b, d, g/) and aspirated plosives (/p\u02b0, t\u02b0, k\u02b0/) in Ancient Greek stand for corresponding fricative sounds in Modern Greek. The correspondences are as follows: [PAR] Among the vowel symbols, Modern Greek sound values reflect the radical simplification of the vowel system of post-classical Greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into a much smaller number. This leads to several groups of vowel letters denoting identical sounds today. Modern Greek orthography remains true to the historical spellings in most of these cases. As a consequence, the spellings of words in Modern Greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable. [PAR] The following vowel letters and digraphs are involved in the mergers: [PAR] Modern Greek speakers typically use the same, modern, sound-symbol mappings in reading Greek of all historical stages. In other countries, students of Ancient Greek may use a variety of conventional approximations of the historical sound system in pronouncing Ancient Greek. [PAR] Digraphs and letter combinations  [PAR] Several letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components. Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized",

Attempted to shake-off his \"Red Ed\" tag by talking about the \"squeezed middle\" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. [PAR] He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on \"refounding\" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. [PAR] The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. [PAR] ED BALLS - SHADOW CHANCELLOR [PAR] As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44 , became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. [PAR] YVETTE COOPER - SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITIES [PAR] Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. [PAR] DOUGLAS ALEXANDER - SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY [PAR] The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43 , he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world.

At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623. [PAR] In 1616, with his health declining, Shakespeare revised his will. Since his only son Hamnet had died",

To generate a question that probes the domain expert's knowledge of the historical context of Elizabethan England and its impact on Shakespeare's life and works, we need to carefully analyze the information provided.\n\nFirst, we note that Shakespeare was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth, which suggests that his social status was not particularly high. However, his father was a glovemaker and tradesman, and his mother was the daughter of an affluent farmer, which indicates that the family was not extremely poor either.\n\nThe context also highlights the significance of social status in Elizabethan England, particularly in the context of education and career advancement. Shakespeare did not attend university, which was a significant limitation for someone who wanted to pursue a career in the arts. Instead, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior, and began to work as an actor and playwright.\n\nTo generate a question that requires a deep understanding of the historical context and its impact on Shakespeare's life and works, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1.

Why not just count the verses?\u201d [PAR] Because verses vary in length, and with such brief books, it\u2019s best not to risk it. And if we were going by verse count, we\u2019d be dealing with a different ordered list. Philemon\u00a0has more verses than Obadiah (the shortest book in the Old Testament), but fewer words. Second John has fewer verses than Third John, but more words. If we were going by verse count, we\u2019d still know the shortest books of the Bible, but we\u2019d have them out of order.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Carry On (franchise)The Carry On franchise primarily consists of a sequence of 31 low-budget British comedy motion pictures (1958\u201392), four Christmas specials, a television series of thirteen episodes, and three West End and provincial stage plays. The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. [PAR] The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978\u201392). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958\u201366), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967\u201392). [PAR] Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u201362) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u201374). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. [PAR] All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. [PAR] Background [PAR] \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". [PAR] The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.) [PAR] The stock-in-trade of Carry On humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (Nurse, Doctor, Again Doctor, Matron), the monarchy (Henry), the Empire (Up the Khyber), the armed forces (Sergeant) and the trade unions (At Your Convenience) as well as the Hammer horror film (Screaming), camping (Camping), foreigners (Abroad), beauty contests (Girls), and caravan holidays (Behind) among others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they proved very popular with audiences.

The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, and their relation with the first minister and cabinets has over time differed with the various French constitutions. [PAR] The President of France is also the ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra, Grand Master of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite and honorary proto-canon of the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. [PAR] The current President of France is Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who took office on 15 May 2012. [PAR] Election [PAR] Since the Referendum on the Direct Election of the President of the French Republic in 1962, the President has been directly elected by universal suffrage; he or she was previously elected by an electoral college. [PAR] After the Referendum on the Reduction of the Mandate of the President of the French Republic, 2000, the length of the term was reduced to five years from the previous seven; the first election to a shorter term was held in 2002. President Chirac was first elected in 1995 and again in 2002. At that time, there was no limit on the number of terms, so Chirac could have run again, but chose not to. He was succeeded by Nicolas Sarkozy on 16 May 2007. [PAR] Following a further change, the  Constitutional law on the Modernisation of the Institutions of the Fifth Republic, 2008, a president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac are the only Presidents to date who have served a full two terms (14 years for the former, 12 years for the latter). [PAR] In order to be admitted as an official candidate, potential candidates must receive signed nominations (informally known as parrainages, for \"godfathering\") from more than 500 elected officials, mostly mayors. These officials must be from at least 30 d\u00e9partements or overseas collectivities, and no more than 10% of them should be from the same d\u00e9partement or collectivity.. Furthermore, each official may nominate only one candidate.. There are exactly 45,543 elected officials, including 33,872 mayors. [PAR] Spending and financing of campaigns and political parties are highly regulated. There is a cap on spending, at approximately 20\u00a0million euros, and government public financing of 50% of spending if the candidate scores more than 5%. If the candidate receives less than 5% of the vote, the government funds \u20ac8,000,000 to the party (\u20ac4,000,000 paid in advance).  Advertising on TV is forbidden but official time is given to candidates on public TV. An independent agency regulates election and party financing. [PAR] French presidential elections are conducted via run-off voting which ensures that the elected President always obtains a majority: if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting, the two highest-scoring candidates arrive at a run-off. After the president is elected, he goes through a solemn investiture ceremony called a \"passation des pouvoirs\" (\"handing over of powers\").  [PAR] Powers [PAR] The French Fifth Republic is a semi-presidential system. Unlike many other European presidents, the French President is quite powerful. Although it is the Prime Minister of France and parliament that oversee much of the nation's actual day-to-day affairs, the French President wields significant influence and authority, especially in the fields of national security and foreign policy. The president holds the nation's most senior office, and outranks all other politicians. [PAR] The president's greatest power is his/her ability to choose the prime minister. However, since the French National Assembly has the sole power to dismiss the Prime Minister's government, the president is forced to name a prime minister who can command the support of a majority in the assembly.

He was the Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016, and has been Member of Parliament for Witney since 2001. Cameron identifies as a One-Nation Conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. [PAR] Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.  It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage. [PAR] Internationally, his government militarily intervened in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured a majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as Prime Minister leading a Conservative government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he chose to resign to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.  [PAR] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for reining in the United Kingdom's national debt. Conversely, he has been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of political opportunism and social elitism. Cameron appeared on the Forbes List of The World's Most Powerful People from 2010.  [PAR] Family [PAR] Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010), a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur,  Mount (born 1934), a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.  Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962. The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".  [PAR] Cameron was born in Marylebone, London,  and raised in Peasemore, Berkshire.  He has a brother, Alexander Cameron, QC (born 1963), a barrister,  and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).  [PAR] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;  Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,  who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.  [PAR] Cameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh, and English.\"  He has also referenced the German Jewish ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the Yiddish author Elia Levita.

The ark itself is often viewed as a symbol of the Church, which provides refuge and salvation for believers.\n\nIn analyzing the context, it is essential to consider the underlying themes, such as the nature of God, the consequences of sin, and the importance of obedience and faith. The narrative also raises questions about the relationship between God and humanity, the role of divine judgment, and the concept of salvation.\n\nThe question topic, \"The biblical account of Noah's Ark and its significance in Christian theology,\" invites exploration of these themes and ideas. A thoughtful and probing question can encourage deeper engagement with the content, critical reflection on the implications, and a nuanced understanding of the biblical account and its significance in Christian theology.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What symbolic significance does the dove's return with an olive branch hold in the context of Noah's Ark and the subsequent covenant between God and humanity?\nExplanation: The dove's return with an olive branch signifies the end of the flood and the beginning of a new era of God's relationship with humanity. It represents hope, peace, and the promise of God's mercy and salvation.

[PAR] Jacob was one of the great patriarchs of the Old Testament, but at times he was also a schemer, liar, and manipulator. [PAR] God established his covenant with Jacob's grandfather, Abraham . The blessings continued through Jacob's father, Isaac , then to Jacob and his descendants. Jacob's sons became leaders of the 12 tribes of Israel . [PAR] The younger of twins, Jacob was born holding on to his brother Esau 's heel. His name means \"he grasps the heel\" or \"he deceives.\" Jacob lived up to his name. He and his mother Rebekah cheated Esau out of his birthright and blessing. Later in Jacob's life, God renamed him Israel, which means \"he struggles with God.\" [PAR] In fact, Jacob struggled with God his entire life, as many of us do. As he matured in faith , Jacob depended on God more and more. But the turning point for Jacob came after a dramatic, all-night wrestling match with God. In the end, the Lord touched Jacob's hip and he was a broken man, but also a new man. From that day forward, Jacob was called Israel. [PAR] And for the rest of his life he walked with a limp, demonstrating his dependence on the Lord. Jacob finally learned to give up control to God. [PAR] Jacob's story teaches us how an imperfect person can be greatly blessed by God--not because of who he or she is, but because of who God is. [PAR] Accomplishments of Jacob in the Bible [PAR] Jacob in the Bible account fathered 12 sons, who became leaders of the 12 tribes of Israel. One of them was Joseph, a key figure in the Old Testament. [PAR] His name is frequently associated with God in the Bible: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. [PAR] Jacob persevered in his love for Rachel. He proved to be a hard worker. [PAR] Jacob's Strengths [PAR] Jacob was clever. Sometimes this trait worked for him, and sometimes it backfired on him. [PAR] He used both his mind and strength to build his wealth and family. [PAR] Jacob's Weaknesses [PAR] Sometimes Jacob made his own rules, deceiving others for selfish gain. He did not trust God to work things out. [PAR] Even though God revealed himself to Jacob in the Bible, Jacob took a long time to become a true servant of the Lord. [PAR] He favored Joseph over his other sons, leading to jealousy and strife within his family. [PAR] Life Lessons [PAR] The sooner we trust God in life, the longer we will benefit from his blessings. When we fight God, we are in a losing battle. [PAR] We often worry about missing the will of God for our life, but God works with our mistakes and bad decisions. His plans cannot be upset.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number onesIn the United Kingdom, Christmas number ones are singles that are top of the UK Singles Chart in the week in which Christmas Day falls. Novelty songs, charity songs or songs with a Christmas theme have regularly been at the top of Christmas charts.  Traditionally the volume of record sales in the UK peaks at Christmas,  with the Christmas number one being considered especially prestigious, more so than any other time of year.    Many of the Christmas number ones were also the best-selling song of the year. Due to the common practice of dating a chart by the date on which the week ends, the Christmas chart is dated the end of the week containing 25 December, but comprises sales for the week before that. The most recent Christmas number one single is \"A Bridge over You\" by the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir.  [PAR] History [PAR] The official UK Singles Chart began in 1952 after appearing in the New Musical Express;  the positions of all songs are based on week end sale totals (from Sunday to Saturday until 2015, then from Friday to Thursday).  Before 1987 they were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.  The emergence of a serious contest for the Christmas number-one spot began in 1973 when the band Slade deliberately released \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" as an effort to reach the top of the charts on Christmas.   [PAR] Since 2002 the Christmas number one has been dominated by reality television contests, with the winners often heading straight to number one in the week before Christmas. This trend began when Popstars: The Rivals contestants released the top three singles on the Christmas chart.  From 2005 to 2008, 2010 and 2013 to 2014, the winners of The X Factor took the number-one spot on eight occasions. In 2007, the X Factor single was so much of a prohibitive favourite for number one that bookmakers started taking bets on which song would be the \"Christmas Number Two\" instead.  [PAR] Rage Against the Machine's 1992 single \"Killing in the Name\" outsold Joe McElderry in 2009 following a successful Facebook campaign.   This made them the first group to get a Christmas number one with a download-only single, and resulted in the most download sales in a single week in UK chart history. Similar campaigns in 2010 promoting acts such as Biffy Clyro, John Cage and The Trashmen were unsuccessful.  The following year, participants from reality television show The Choir outsold X Factor winners Little Mix and a host of social network campaigns for various novelty acts,   and in 2012, a supergroup cover of \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", supporting charities associated with the Hillsborough disaster, took the accolade ahead of The X Factors James Arthur.  Following the UK Charts' move to Fridays,  the 2015 Christmas number one was revealed on Christmas Day;   that year's chart was the first in a decade to not feature the X Factor winner's single in either first or second.   [PAR] Records [PAR] The Beatles are the only act to have four Christmas number ones, three consecutively starting from 1963. On two occasions, 1963 and 1967, they had both the Christmas number one and the number two, the only act to have achieved this. As part of two acts, George Michael repeated the feat with Band Aid and Wham! in 1984. Paul McCartney has been top eight times with various acts. Cliff Richard has spent four Christmasses at number one; two as a solo act, one with The Shadows and one as part of Band Aid II. The Spice Girls later equalled the record of having three consecutive Christmas number ones, from 1996 to 1998. Spice Girl Melanie C achieved a fourth Christmas number one as a member of The Justice Collective in 2012, which also gave Robbie Williams his third. [PAR] \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen, which reached the number-one spot at Christmas 1975 and 1991, is the only record to have reached the top twice. \"Mary's Boy Child\" is the only song to be Christmas number one for two entirely unrelated",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Driest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile - Extreme ScienceDriest Desert | Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Driest Place: Atacama Desert, Chile [PAR] Even the Driest Place on Earth has Water [PAR] These incredibly     dry mountains see an average of less than .004 inches/.01cm of     rain per year. Many times this area will go without rainfall at      all for years. Some places in the Atacama Desert have not      had rainfall for over 400 years.  The     Atacama desert is found along the coast of Chile, South America -      right next to the Pacific Ocean - the biggest body of water      in the world. Much of the desert extends up into the Andes mountains      and is very high in elevation. Unlike more familiar deserts, like     the Sahara desert in Africa and the Mojave in California, the Atacama      is actually a pretty cold place, with average daily temperatures ranging      between 0\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. The annual rainfall (or lack of it)      defines a desert, but that doesn't mean that it never rains in Atacama.     Every so often a warming effect over the Pacific Ocean around the      equator changes the weather the world over and even places like the      driest desert in the world can become doused with drenching storms.     Even though Atacama gets almost no rainfall, there is water in this      arid place and you'll find it in the following places: [PAR] Salt Lakes [PAR] During years     of heavy rainfall in the distant past, enough water accumulated in     basins found throughout the Andes to create lakes. Some of the lakes     got their water from melting glaciers at the end of the last ice age.      But in some lakes in the Andes mountains, such as Atacama, more water      is lost through evaporation than is replaced by rainfall so the lakes      are drying up. As the water evaporates, the mineral salts in the water      become more concentrated, creating very salty water. [PAR] Snow [PAR] In the higher          elevations when precipitation comes to Atacama snow falls instead          of rain. There are small patches of unmelted snow in the mountain          tops where in never gets warm enough to melt the snow. [PAR] Underground [PAR] Anywhere you      go in the world, regardless of how much or little it rains, there      is always water underground. After it rains, some of the rainwater      evaporates back into the air, but much of it trickles down into the      ground and stays there - even in the desert. How much water and where      depends on a number of things; soil composition, air and soil surface      temperature, amount and frequency of rainfall/precipitation, and drainage.      Since the Andes is a volcanically active mountain range, the magma      beneath the ground will heat the groundwater in certain places causing      geysers to erupt. [PAR] Fog and Dew [PAR] This mummy of a girl is from the Atacama Desert. Her remains are            estimated to be about 800 years old. Find out more about mummies. [PAR] Most of the precipitation that comes to the      Atacama is in the form of fog that blows in the from the Pacific.      Fog is essentially very low clouds, consisting of water vapor cooling      and beginning to condense. If you've ever been in fog you know that      it can leave you a little moist. When the air temperature reaches      dew point the water vapor in the air condenses to leave little droplets      of water behind. The few things that are able to survive in the Atacama live on the combined moisture from fog and dew. [PAR] Does Anything Live There? [PAR] Many people          have the view that deserts are places forsaken by Mother Nature and          that no living thing would possibly want to set up camp in a place so          dry. Although it is tough to find anything living in the Atacama there          are isolated pockets and small patches of plants, which support life          for animals and insects. Some plant species have adapted well to this          dry environment by developing tap roots that run very deep into the          ground gathering water from below. There are flocks of flamingos that          live in and around the salt",

The question topic specifically asks about the role of salt lakes in the Atacama Desert, including their formation and the concentration of mineral salts in the water. \n\nTo generate a question that probes domain expert knowledge, we must consider the nuances of salt lake formation, the geological and climatic factors influencing their water composition, and the implications of these processes on the ecosystem. The analysis reveals that salt lakes in the Atacama Desert are formed when water accumulates in basins, often from heavy rainfall in the distant past or melting glaciers, and then undergoes significant evaporation, leading to a concentration of mineral salts.\n\nThe complexity of this topic lies in understanding the hydrological cycle in arid environments, the geological history of the region, and the chemical processes that occur as water evaporates.

It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers.

He was a defensive expert who created fortifications for Saratoga , Philadelphia, and West Point. He later urged that the Military Academy be situated at West Point . He was also friends with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Kosciuszko returned to Poland in 1787 and waged war against neighboring countries for Polish independence. Later he retired to Switzerland, writing books about military strategy. After his death in 1817, Kosciuszko was hailed not only as a Polish patriot but also as a great American and a true citizen of the world.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Theodore RooseveltTheodore  Roosevelt Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858 \u2013 January 6, 1919) was an American statesman, author, explorer, soldier, naturalist, and reformer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. [PAR] Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College. His first of many books, The Naval War of 1812 (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the American West and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders, where he gained national fame for courage during the Spanish\u2013American War. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president as McKinley's running mate in the election of 1900. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley's re-election in a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism. [PAR] Following the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, succeeded to the office, becoming the youngest United States President in history. Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era, he championed his \"Square Deal\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Making conservation a top priority, he established a myriad of new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. [PAR] Elected in 1904 to a full term, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, William Howard Taft, to succeed him in the presidency. After leaving office, Roosevelt went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor. He tried but failed to win the presidential nomination in 1912. Roosevelt founded his own party, the Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split among Republicans enabled the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in 1912. The Democrats in the South had also gained power by having disenfranchised most blacks (and Republicans) from the political system from 1890 to 1908, fatally weakening the Republican Party across the region, and creating a Solid South dominated by their party alone. Republicans aligned with Taft nationally would control the Republican Party for decades. [PAR] Frustrated at home, Roosevelt led a two-year expedition in the Amazon Basin, nearly dying of tropical disease. During World War I, he opposed President Woodrow Wilson for keeping the U.S. out of the war against Germany, and offered his military services, which were never summoned. Although planning to run again for president in 1920, Roosevelt suffered deteriorating health and died in early 1919.",

More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 were killed during the hysteria. [PAR] Ever since those dark days ended, the trials have become synonymous with mass hysteria and scapegoating. The following are some facts about the Salem Witch Trials: [PAR] What Were the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials were a series of witchcraft cases brought before local magistrates in a settlement called Salem which was a part of the Massachusetts Bay colony in the 17th century. [PAR] When Exactly Did the Salem Witch Trials Take Place? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials officially began in February of 1692, when the afflicted girls accused the first three victims, Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchcraft and ended in May of 1693, when the remaining victims were released from jail. [PAR] What Caused the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials was a classic example of scapegoating. Fear combined with a \u201ctrigger,\u201d a traumatic or stressful event, is what often leads to scapegoating. Fear of the Devil, and witches who did his bidding, was very real in Salem at the time. [PAR] In Massachusetts during the 17th century , people often feared that the Devil was constantly trying to find ways to infiltrate and destroy Christians and their communities. [PAR] As a devout and strongly religious community living in near isolation in the mysterious New World, the community of Salem had a heightened sense of fear of the Devil and then experienced a \u201ctrigger\u201d when Tituba, one of the accused witches, confessed that she and others were in fact witches working for the Devil. [PAR] This induced panic and hysteria and quickly sparked a massive witch hunt. The fact is, although there were many other contributing factors, Tituba\u2019s confession is the main reason why the Salem Witch Trials happened. [PAR] The Massachusetts Bay colonists had accused and convicted people of witchcraft before, starting with Margaret Jones in 1648, but nobody in the colony had ever confessed to being a witch before or ominously stated that there were other witches out there. Tituba\u2019s simple confession reinforced all of the colonist\u2019s underlying fears. [PAR] \u201cThe Witch, No. 1,\u201d lithograph by Joseph E. Baker, published by George H. Walker & Co, circa 1892 [PAR] In addition to this constant sense of fear, Salem residents were also under a great deal of stress during this period due to a number of factors. [PAR] One major factor was that in 1684, King Charles II revoked the Massachusetts Bay Colony\u2019s royal charter, a legal document granting the colonists permission to colonize the area. [PAR] The charter was revoked because the colonists had violated several of the charter\u2019s rules, which included basing laws on religious beliefs and discriminating against Anglicans. [PAR] Charles II died shortly after and James II replaced him and merged the Massachusetts Bay Colony into the Dominion of New England which instituted a royally-appointed government with many strict new laws. In 1689, after the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, the Massachusetts Bay colonists overthrew the unpopular Dominion of New England. [PAR] In 1691, the new King and Queen of England, Mary and William of Orange, issued a new, more anti-religious charter, instead of reissuing the old charter, and also combined the Massachusetts Bay Colony , Plymouth Colony and several other colonies into one. The new charter and regime basically continued the policies of the Dominion of New England. [PAR] The puritans, who had left England due to religious persecution, feared their religion was under attack again and worried they were losing control of their colony. The political instability and threat to their religion created a feeling of uneasiness and discontent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [PAR] Other factors included a recent small pox epidemic in the colony, growing rivalries between families within the colony, a constant threat of attack from nearby Native-American tribes, and a recent influx of refugees trying to escape King William\u2019s war with France in Canada and upstate New York.

At 16, he left home for the nearby city of Detroit, where he found apprentice work as a machinist. He returned to Dearborn and work on the family farm after three years, but continued to operate and service steam engines and work occasional stints in Detroit factories. In 1888, he married Clara Bryant, who had grown up on a nearby farm. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] The mass production techniques Henry Ford championed eventually allowed Ford Motor Company to turn out one Model T every 24 seconds. [PAR] In the first several years of their marriage, Ford supported himself and his new wife by running a sawmill. In 1891, he returned with Clara to Detroit, where he was hired as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company. Rising quickly through the ranks, he was promoted to chief engineer two years later. Around the same time, Clara gave birth to the couple\u2019s only son, Edsel Bryant Ford. On call 24 hours a day for his job at Edison, Ford spent his irregular hours on his efforts to build a gasoline-powered horseless carriage, or automobile. In 1896, he completed what he called the \u201cQuadricycle,\u201d which consisted of a light metal frame fitted with four bicycle wheels and powered by a two-cylinder, four-horsepower gasoline engine. [PAR] Henry Ford: Birth of Ford Motor Company and the Model T [PAR] Determined to improve upon his prototype, Ford sold the Quadricycle in order to continue building other vehicles. He received backing from various investors over the next seven years, some of whom formed the Detroit Automobile Company (later the Henry Ford Company) in 1899. His partners, eager to put a passenger car on the market, grew frustrated with Ford\u2019s constant need to improve, and Ford left his namesake company in 1902. (After his departure, it was reorganized as the Cadillac Motor Car Company.) The following year, Ford established the Ford Motor Company. [PAR] A month after the Ford Motor Company was established, the first Ford car\u2014the two-cylinder, eight-horsepower Model A\u2014was assembled at a plant on Mack Avenue in Detroit. At the time, only a few cars were assembled per day, and groups of two or three workers built them by hand from parts that were ordered from other companies. Ford was dedicated to the production of an efficient and reliable automobile that would be affordable for everyone; the result was the Model T , which made its debut in October 1908. [PAR] Henry Ford: Production & Labor Innovations [PAR] The \u201cTin Lizzie,\u201d as the Model T was known, was an immediate success, and Ford soon had more orders than the company could satisfy. As a result, he put into practice techniques of mass production that would revolutionize American industry, including the use of large production plants; standardized, interchangeable parts; and the moving assembly line. Mass production significantly cut down on the time required to produce an automobile, which allowed costs to stay low. In 1914, Ford also increased the daily wage for an eight-hour day for his workers to $5 (up from $2.34 for nine hours), setting a standard for the industry. [PAR] Even as production went up, demand for the Tin Lizzie remained high, and by 1918, half of all cars in America were Model Ts. In 1919, Ford named his son Edsel as president of Ford Motor Company, but he retained full control of the company\u2019s operations. After a court battle with his stockholders, led by brothers Horace and John Dodge, Henry Ford bought out all minority stockholders by 1920. In 1927, Ford moved production to a massive industrial complex he had built along the banks of the River Rouge in Dearborn, Michigan. The plant included a glass factory, steel mill, assembly line and all other necessary components of automotive production. That same year, Ford ceased",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Lincoln, EnglandLincoln is a cathedral city and the county town of Lincolnshire, within the East Midlands of England. The non-metropolitan district of Lincoln has a 2012 population of 94,600.  The 2011 census gave the entire urban area of Lincoln (which includes North Hykeham and Waddington) a population of 130,200.  [PAR] Lincoln developed from the Roman town of Lindum Colonia, which developed from an Iron Age settlement. Lincoln's major landmarks are Lincoln Cathedral, a famous example of English Gothic architecture, and Lincoln Castle, an 11th-century Norman castle. The city is also home to the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University. Lincoln is situated in a gap in the Lincoln Cliff 141 mi north of London, at an elevation of  above sea level by the River Witham, stretching up to 75 m above sea level in the uphill area around the cathedral. [PAR] History [PAR] Earliest history: Lincoln [PAR] The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in 1972) that have been dated to the 1st century BC. This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the River Witham at the foot of a large hill (on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle). [PAR] The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brythonic language of Iron Age Britain's Celtic inhabitants as Lindon \"The Pool\",  presumably referring to the Brayford Pool (compare the etymology of the name Dublin, from the Gaelic dubh linn \"black pool\"). The extent of this original settlement is unknown as its remains are now buried deep beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins, and modern Lincoln. [PAR] Roman history: Lindum Colonia [PAR] The Romans conquered this part of Britain in AD 48 and shortly afterwards built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake formed by the widening of the River Witham (the modern day Brayford Pool) and at the northern end of the Fosse Way Roman road (A46). The Celtic name Lindon was subsequently Latinised to Lindum and given the title Colonia when it was converted into a settlement for army veterans.  [PAR] The conversion to a colonia was made when the legion moved on to York (Eboracum) in AD 71. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after its founder Domitian, was established within the walls of the hilltop fortress with the addition of an extension of about equal area, down the hillside to the waterside below. [PAR] It became a major flourishing settlement, accessible from the sea both through the River Trent and through the River Witham. On the basis of the patently corrupt list of British bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles, the city is now often considered to have been the capital of the province of Flavia Caesariensis which was formed during the late-3rd century Diocletian Reforms. Subsequently, however, the town and its waterways fell into decline. By the close of the 5th century the city was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a Praefectus Civitatis, for Saint Paulinus visited a man of this office in Lincoln in AD 629. [PAR] AD 410\u20131066 [PAR] During this period the Latin name Lindum Colonia was shortened in Old English to become first Lindocolina, then Lincylene.  [PAR] After the first destructive Viking raids, the city once again rose to some importance, with overseas trading connections. In Viking times Lincoln was a trading centre that issued coins from its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to the mint at York.  After the establishment of Dane Law in 886, Lincoln became one of The Five Boroughs in the East Midlands. Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that this area, deserted since Roman times, received new timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system in about 900.  Lincoln experienced an unprecedented explosion in its economy with the settlement of the Danes. Like York, the Upper City seems to have been given over to purely administrative functions up to 850 or so, while the Lower",

Though the origins of curling are unclear, most people regard Scotland as curling\u2019s birthplace. Today, curling is played around the world, largely thanks to its introduction into the Olympics in 1988. Because curling can seem complicated if you don\u2019t know a lot about it, these articles help to explain the basics, from curling terminology and the roles of each position on a team, to how scoring and other elements of the game work, and why curling is such a great sport to play. [PAR] Curling Match Terminology [PAR] Curling, probably more than any other sport, has its own unique terminology (like hurry hard and burning a rock, among others). Here are the key curling words and phrases you need to know to blend in at your next bonspiel: [PAR] Blank end: An end where no points are scored. [PAR] Bonspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete. [PAR] Burning a rock: A rules infraction that happens when a player touches a stone as it\u2019s traveling down the sheet. [PAR] Button: The very center of the target rings or house. [PAR] Cashspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete for money. [PAR] Delivery: The action of throwing a stone to the other end of the playing surface. [PAR] Eight-ender: A perfect end where every one of the team\u2019s stones scores a point. [PAR] End: The way a curling game is divided. An end is like an inning in a baseball game. A curling game has either eight or ten ends. [PAR] Gripper: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you keep your footing on the ice. See slider. [PAR] Hammer: The last rock of the end. [PAR] Hack: The foothold in the ice you use to push off from when you deliver the stone. [PAR] House: Also known as the rings, this is the name of the giant bull\u2019s eye at either end of the sheet of ice. It consists of a set of concentric circles, called the 12-foot, 8-foot, 4-foot, and the Button. [PAR] Hurry hard: A directive given to sweepers by the skip or third, to begin sweeping. [PAR] Rink: A curling team; also the name of a curling facility [PAR] Rock: Also known as a stone, the granite playing utensil that a curler delivers. Regular-sized rocks weigh approximately 44 pounds. [PAR] Sheet: The frozen playing surface on which the game is played. [PAR] Slider: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you move or slide along the ice. [PAR] Tee line: The line on the playing surface that runs through the middle of the house. [PAR] Weight: The amount of force used to deliver a stone. [PAR] The Members of a Curling Team [PAR] In curling, the team you play on is called a rink. The rink is made up of four players: the lead, the second, the third (also called the vice, vice-skip, or mate), and the skip. Each player has specific duties: [PAR] Lead: The lead throws the first two rocks of the end and then sweeps the next six. The lead must be very good at throwing guards and a strong sweeper. [PAR] Second: The second throws the third and fourth stones of the end and should be strong at playing takeouts. The second sweeps the first two stones and then the final four of the end. The second and the lead need to be in sync when sweeping together. [PAR] Third: The third (or mate or vice), who throws the fifth and sixth rocks of the end, must be good at all shots, but especially draws. It is the third\u2019s job to set up the shots that will be thrown by the skip, and to help the skip discuss the strategy of the final two stones of the end.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] St Trinian's SchoolSt Trinian's was a British gag cartoon comic strip series, created and drawn by Ronald Searle from 1946 until 1952.  The cartoons all centre on a boarding school for girls, where the teachers are sadists and the girls are juvenile delinquents. The series was Searle's most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films that has outlived the short-running cartoon series. [PAR] Concept [PAR] The first cartoon appeared in 1941, but shortly afterwards Searle had to fulfil his military service. He was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 he started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was a lot darker in comparison with the previous years. [PAR] The school is the antithesis of the type of posh girls' boarding school depicted by Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil; its female pupils are bad and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the uniform of the school that Searle's daughter Kate attended, JAGS in Dulwich. The films implied that the girls were the daughters of gangsters, crooks, shady bookmakers, and other low-lifes and the institution is often referred to as a \"female borstal\". [PAR] The inspiration [PAR] During 1941 Searle had left for the artist's community in the village of Kirkcudbright in Edinburgh and it was whilst visiting the family Johnston there that he made a drawing to please their two schoolgirl daughters, C\u00e9cil\u00e9 and Pat, (their school had been evacuated to New Gala House in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders owing to the war), and Searle was puzzled as to why two schoolgirls should seem so keen to return to their school, an Academy for Young Ladies in Dalkeith Road \u2014 the name of their school was St Trinnean's.   [PAR] Searle's St. Trinian's was based on two independent girls' schools in Cambridge\u2014Perse School for Girls, now known as the co-educational Stephen Perse Foundation, and St Mary's School. Searle, growing up in Cambridge, saw the girls on their way to and from school on a regular basis and they were the original inspiration for the cartoons and the character. Testaments to this fact can be found in the Perse School for Girls' Archive area where there are several original  St Trinian's books, given to the school by Ronald Searle. He also based the school partly on the former Cambridgeshire High School for Girls (now Long Road Sixth Form College).

Wyndham-Lewis) [PAR] * Souls in Torment (1953) [PAR] Films [PAR] In the 1950s, a series of St Trinians comedy films was made featuring well-known British actors including Alastair Sim (in drag as the headmistress, but also playing her brother), George Cole as spiv \"Flash Harry\", Joyce Grenfell as Sgt Ruby Gates, a beleaguered policewoman, and Richard Wattis and Eric Barker as the civil servants at the Ministry of Education for whom the school is a source of constant frustration and nervous breakdowns.  Searle's cartoons appeared in the films' main title design. [PAR] In the films the school became embroiled in various shady enterprises, thanks mainly to Flash, and, as a result, was always threatened with closure by the Ministry.
