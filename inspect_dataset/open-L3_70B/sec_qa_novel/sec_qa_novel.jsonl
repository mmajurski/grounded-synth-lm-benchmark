Tools of the Trade {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tools_of_the_trade}\nWith all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the question remains, \\\"What can be done?\\\" There\n\nare a few tools the security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture including: *user\n\nawareness*, *anti-malware software*, *backups*, and *encryption*.\n\n::: description-list\n\n[User Awareness]{.term}\n\n:   [A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared users will run malware programs or perform\n\n    other harmful actions as directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may impersonate others or perform\n\n    other *social engineering* tactics to cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is the ease\n\n    with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally\n\n    reach out to users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training programs and other methods of interaction\n\n    a security professional can make users aware of these threats and train them to act accordingly. Raising user\n\n    awareness is a critical component of any security plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Anti-Malware Software]{.term}\n\n:   [Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been developed to prevent its usage. These tools may\n\n    filter download requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to detect active malware patterns,\n\n    scan files for malware signatures, or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security plan will\n\n    typically detail the type of anti-malware software being used as well as the intended purpose of its\n\n    usage.]{.principal}\n\n[Backups]{.term}\n\n:   [Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick solution to the problems of ransomware and other\n\n    attacks aimed at causing or threatening system failure. While a backup does not solve the problem of the data being\n\n    sold or used by others, it does allow for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a security\n\n    plan.]{.principal}\n\n[Encryption]{.term}\n\n:   [At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to make it useful. Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key. Often,\n\n    encryption and backups complement each other and fill in the use cases that each lacks individually. As such,\n\n    encryption will show up multiple times and in multiple ways in an average security plan.]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.7.

False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine. The result was a\n\nmachine that was unusable.\n\nFor 13 minutes, Webroot distributed this rule to its antivirus software shutting down operations on an untold number of\n\nmachines. Fortunately Webroot was able to quickly identify the problem and send out an update which would have allowed\n\nthe machines to automatically fix the problem. Unfortunately their infrastructure for distributing the update quickly\n\nbecame overloaded.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nWhen a security solution fails to identify a threat, this is known as a *false negative*. While no solution can ever be\n\n100% effective, false negatives can undermine confidence in a product. False negatives may be resolved by a skilled SOC\n\nteam, closely monitoring what is happening. It is also possible to address false negatives through *Layered Security* a\n\nconcept that we will cover next.\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.2. Layered Security\"}\n",

The central idea of the context revolves around false positives and negatives in security solutions, their implications, and potential resolutions. \n\nThe context explains that false positives occur when a security solution detects a threat that does not exist, which can lead to teams ignoring alerts due to their frequency, thus rendering the security solution ineffective. It highlights the importance of tuning the rule set used to trigger warnings to lower the false positive rate. \n\nOn the other hand, false negatives happen when a security solution fails to identify an actual threat, undermining confidence in the product. The context suggests that false negatives can be addressed by a skilled Security Operations Center (SOC) team through close monitoring and the concept of Layered Security.\n\nGiven the question topic about the relationship between the complexity of security solutions and the risk of false positives and negatives, we need to consider how the intricacy of these solutions impacts their ability to accurately detect threats without generating excessive false alarms or missing real threats.\n\nThe complexity of security solutions can indeed influence both false positives and negatives. More complex solutions might utilize advanced technologies like artificial intelligence or machine learning, which can potentially reduce false positives by more accurately identifying threats. However, this complexity can also introduce more variables that could lead to false negatives if not properly calibrated or if the solution is not adequately trained on diverse datasets.\n\nTherefore, the question should aim to explore this delicate balance and the strategies that can be employed to mitigate the risks associated with both false positives and negatives in complex security solutions.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How can the calibration of complex security solutions leveraging artificial intelligence mitigate the trade-off between reducing false positives and minimizing false negatives?\nExplanation: The answer requires an understanding of how advanced technologies in security solutions can impact the detection of threats. Proper calibration of these systems, especially those using AI, is crucial for reducing false positives without increasing the risk of false negatives. This involves carefully tuning the system's parameters and ensuring it is trained on a comprehensive and diverse set of data to recognize legitimate threats accurately.\nCorrect Answer: By optimizing AI model training data and thresholds.\n</output_format>",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a highly insightful and probing question-answer pair, we need to carefully analyze the provided context and question topic. The context describes a scenario where students line up to show their ID to an attendant, who then crosses off their ID number from a list to receive a free breakfast. The question topic asks us to evaluate the effectiveness of social engineering tactics in exploiting this system and relate it to similar tactics used in cyber attacks.\n\nFirst, let's identify the central idea and significant relationships within the context. The scenario presents a physical security system that relies on visual verification of student IDs. The question topic focuses on social engineering tactics, which involve manipulating individuals into performing certain actions or divulging sensitive information.\n\nNext, we need to consider implicit assumptions, subtle details, and underlying theories. One assumption is that the attendant is not thoroughly verifying the IDs, and students are not closely monitoring the list. A subtle detail is the example provided, where a student claims to have forgotten their ID but knows someone else's ID number.\n\nNow, let's rate the difficulty of the question (1-10). Since the question topic requires evaluating social engineering tactics and relating them to cyber attacks, we can rate the difficulty as an 8 out of 10. This requires a deep understanding of social engineering principles and their applications in both physical and cyber security contexts.\n\nTo plan the question, we need to ensure it invites deeper understanding, meaningful reflection, or critical engagement. We should avoid explicit references to the source material and make the question self-contained.\n\nGiven the context and question topic, a potential question could be: \"What social engineering tactic could be used to exploit the breakfast system by manipulating the attendant's perception of identity verification, and how does this relate to phishing attacks in cyber security?\"\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What social engineering tactic could be used to exploit the breakfast system by manipulating the attendant's perception of identity verification, and how does this relate to phishing attacks in cyber security?\nExplanation: This question requires the test-taker to think critically about social engineering tactics and their applications in both physical and cyber security contexts. The correct answer should demonstrate an understanding of how social engineering can be used to manipulate individuals into performing certain actions, and how this relates to phishing attacks in cyber security.\nCorrect Answer: Pretexting, a social engineering tactic where an individual creates a fictional scenario to manipulate the attendant into verifying a false identity, similar to phishing attacks where attackers create fake emails or websites to trick victims into divulging sensitive information.\n</output_format>",

Active Directory {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__active_directory}\nActive Directory (AD) is a directory service typically used in Windows networks to control and track resources. AD is a\n\nMicrosoft technology that enables centralized network management. It has proven to be very scalable and is commonly\n\ndeployed in the enterprise environment (corporations, universities, schools, etc.)\n\nActive Directory relies upon the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for its communications. While AD is\n\nprobably the largest deployed user of LDAP other implementations for various operating systems exist, including Apple\n\nOpenDirectory, RH Directory Server, and OpenLDAP. LDAP is often used by internal applications and process.\n\nThe cornerstone of an AD environment is the Domain Controller (DC). DCs stores directory information about Users,\n\nGroups, Computers, Policies, and more. They respond to auth requests for the domain (network) they are supporting. A\n\nstandard network will have multiple DCs with fail-over in place in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor many environments, AD is the mechanism used for authentication, authorization, and accounting. As many services have\n\nmigrated to the web, the need to access AD from anywhere has become increasingly important. This has kindled the growth\n\nof Azure Active Directory, a cloud-based version of active directory.

Through the shell you can create, read, update, or delete files, make network\n\nconnections, configure kernel parameters, install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells that\n\ncan be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an\n\nattacker would need to have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is being able to interact\n\nwith a shell remotely on the exploited machine.\n\nIn this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect. In these instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out\n\nfrom the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the inside*. This is more compatible with the\n\nfirewalls/NAT routers that sit between most devices and the Internet.\n\nIn either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote connection allows an attacker to basically do\n\nanything they want. To that end, many tools have sprung up to provide remote shell access. A machine may already have a\n\nremote shell tool installed, such as an SSH server. Barring that [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/){.link} can be\n\nused with any executable to provide access to it over a network.

When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes.

To address the question topic, we need to focus on the concept of redundancy as a strategy to support business continuity and disaster recovery. \n\nRedundancy is implied as a crucial element in ensuring continuity, particularly in the context of Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP). Although the term \"redundancy\" is not explicitly defined in the given context, its application can be inferred from the discussion on maintaining business operations and recovering from incidents.\n\nThe context highlights the importance of identifying critical business processes, prioritizing them, and developing recovery procedures. This implies that redundancy can be achieved by duplicating critical components or systems to ensure that if one fails, others can take over, thereby minimizing downtime and supporting business continuity.\n\nConcept exploration reveals that redundancy is not only about having spare parts or backup systems but also about ensuring that these redundant systems are properly tested and can be swiftly activated in case of a disaster. This requires careful planning, regular testing, and maintenance to ensure seamless operation.\n\nStrategic complexity calibration suggests that implementing redundancy can vary in complexity, depending on the specific requirements of the organization, the type of systems involved, and the resources available. However, the core idea is to ensure that critical functions can continue uninterrupted, which can be highly challenging, especially in complex systems.\n\nIntentional question planning involves considering how redundancy supports business continuity and disaster recovery, including examples of its implementation in computer systems.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a highly insightful and probing question-answer pair, a careful analysis of the provided context is necessary. The context discusses indicators of compromise (IoCs) and their role in identifying malware intrusions. It highlights common IoC types, including hashes of malicious files, IP addresses, URLs/domains, and virus definitions/signatures. The context also mentions the public communication of IoCs among security professionals to mitigate the effects of malware.\n\nGiven the question topic, \"Analyzing the role of IoCs in mitigating the effects of malware and their public communication among security professionals,\" the focus should be on the strategic importance and implications of IoCs in cybersecurity. \n\nThe analysis reveals that IoCs are crucial for identifying and mitigating malware intrusions, and their public communication facilitates a collective response to cyber threats. Therefore, a question that probes the depth of understanding of IoCs, their application, and the implications of their public communication would be highly relevant.\n\nDifficulty rating: 8/10\n\nThe question should invite deeper understanding, meaningful reflection, or critical engagement with the content, ensuring it is purposeful and challenging even for domain experts.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What significant advantage does the public communication of indicators of compromise offer in the collective effort to mitigate malware effects, and how does this impact the cybersecurity landscape?\nExplanation: The public communication of IoCs allows security professionals to share knowledge and strategies, enhancing the ability to detect and respond to malware intrusions. This collective approach strengthens cybersecurity by facilitating the swift identification and mitigation of threats, thereby reducing the window of vulnerability.\nCorrect Answer: Enhanced collective threat detection and response capabilities.\n</output_format>",

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT). By utilizing the resources of a nation (often including its\n\nintelligence and military resources) APTs are a severe threat.\n\n:::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.5. Security Plans\"}\n",

Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.  [User accesses a sevice]{.principal}\n\n2.  [User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request]{.principal}\n\n3.  [User logs in]{.principal}\n\n4.  [Credentials are verified]{.principal}\n\n5.  [SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one. The following diagram\n\nhighlights the differences between OpenID authentication and an OAuth flow:\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/oauth.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"oauth\" />\n\n</div>\n\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">OpenID vs. Pseudo-Authentication using OAuth</a> by <a\n\nhref=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\" class=\"link\">Perhelion</a>\n\nused under <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">CC0 1.0</a></figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.10.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table.

Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence.

Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high.

Unix File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__unix_file_permissions}\nFrom its inception, Unix was designed to be a multi-user environment, and as such, a lot of attention was paid to file\n\npermissions. Every file in a Unix system has an owner and a group. Each file also has permissions for owner, group, and\n\nall users. Permissions are set using octal numbers where each bit represents read (bit 0: 1), write (bit 1: 2), or\n\nexecute (bit 2: 4) permission.\n\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/permissions.svg\" alt=\"permissions\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nFor example, if you wanted a read and execute permission the number would be 5 (1 + 4). Read and write permission would\n\nbe 3 (1 + 2).\n\nPermissions are specified with the `chmod`{.literal} command, the first octal number is the permissions for the owner,\n\nthe second is for the group, and the third is for all user. So to change a file to have read, write, and execute\n\npermissions for the owner, read permissions for the group, and no permissions for everyone else, the command would be\n\n`chmod 710 <filename>`{.literal} where `<filename>`{.literal} is the name of your file.\n\nThe owner and group of a file can be set with the `chown`{.literal} command:\n\n`chown <owner>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}.

The KRBTGT account is an account that Windows\n\nmachines use to perform Kerberos administrative tasks. The KRBTGT password hash can be obtained from any machine where\n\nthat account was used if the attacker has complete access to the files on the hard drive. This may be done with physical\n\naccess or through the use of malware on a victim machine.\n\nAn attacker will only be able to forge TGTs until the KRBTGT account password is changed, [so a common remediation\n\nstrategy is to change the\n\npassword](https://blog.quest.com/what-is-krbtgt-and-why-should-you-change-the-password/){.link}.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the Golden Ticket attack against Kerberos authentication, specifically targeting Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs). The KRBTGT account is highlighted as a crucial component, used by Windows machines for Kerberos administrative tasks. The attack exploits the KRBTGT password hash to create forged TGTs, granting access to services. The context also mentions that the KRBTGT password hash can be obtained from any machine where the account was used, given complete access to the files on the hard drive. \n\nTo generate a question, we need to delve into the implications of the KRBTGT account's role in Kerberos authentication and the potential consequences of the Golden Ticket attack. Considering the complexity and the need for a challenging question, we will focus on the strategic aspects of mitigating such attacks and the underlying principles of Kerberos security.\n\nThe question should encourage a deep understanding of Kerberos authentication, the role of the KRBTGT account, and the implications of the Golden Ticket attack. It should also require the application of knowledge about security principles and potential mitigation strategies.\n\nGiven the context, a thoughtful and challenging question can be crafted to probe the domain expert's understanding of Kerberos security, the KRBTGT account's significance, and the strategic approaches to countering the Golden Ticket attack.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What critical factor determines the duration for which an attacker can forge TGTs using the Golden Ticket exploit, and what is the immediate remediation step to mitigate this vulnerability?\nExplanation: The KRBTGT password hash is crucial for creating forged TGTs. The duration for which an attacker can exploit this is directly tied to how often the KRBTGT account password is changed. Changing the KRBTGT account password is the immediate remediation step to mitigate the Golden Ticket vulnerability.\nCorrect Answer: The KRBTGT account password change interval.\n</output_format>",
