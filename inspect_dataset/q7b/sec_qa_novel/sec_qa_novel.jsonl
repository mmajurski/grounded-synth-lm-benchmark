This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed.

False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine.

Some examples of popular SIEMs are QRadar,\n\nSplunk, and Azure Sentinel.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.9. Lab: Exploiting log4j\"}\n\n\n## 6.9.

This vulnerability takes advantage of a flaw\n\nin a common logging library used by many Java applications, including Apache, neo4j, Steam, iCloud, and Minecraft. Any\n\nattacker that can cause a message to be logged can use the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) and cause the\n\ntarget to reach out to another server, LDAP in our example, and load a remote Java class file. This file can contain any\n\ncode that the attacker wishes to inject into the server process.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nDo some research: What versions of log4j are affected by this vulnerability?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nThis lab uses a Docker Compose configuration to simulate a network with an attacker and a target.

Proxies and receive and send requests on behalf of a\n\nuser, allowing for full control over the traffic going out and coming back in.\n\nProxies can be used for caching, access control, URL filtering, content scanning, and even packet inspection. Proxy\n\nsolutions may be explicit or transparent and are offered by many companies including McAfee, Fortigate, Netsparker, and\n\nPalo Alto. A typical application of a proxy would be to filter explicit content on a school district network.\n\nProxies can also be broken into *forward* and *reverse* configurations. A forward proxy passes requests from a private\n\nor internal network to the internet. Forward proxies can speed up local requests through caching and validate that the\n\nrequest should be performed. Forward proxies are interoperable with standard firewalls and network address translation\n\n(NAT).\n\nReverse proxies take requests from an external source and pass it to an internal service. This helps prevent clients\n\nfrom having direct access to internal services. Reverse proxies can utilize caching and validate requests as well. A\n\nreverse proxy can also be configured to work with a firewall. Whereas it used to be common practice to place a server in\n\na demilitarized zone (DMZ) outside of a firewall, it is now far more common to employ a reverse proxy to reach that\n\nserver.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.3.

An intrusion *prevention* system will take it one step further and actually shut down the connection or\n\nkill the offending process.\n\nThese systems employ exploit signatures or IDs that are indicators of compromise (IoCs), anomalies, or strange\n\nbehaviors. The power of an IDS/IPS often comes from how up-to-date it's signature database is. There are many solutions\n\nin the category including Splunk, QRadar, CrowdStrike, and SolarWinds.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.7. Email Solutions\"}\n",

If that data isn't just data, but\n\nactually a JavaScript script, that script may run on the page that displays it.\n\nUsing this technique attackers can access cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information. Depending on where\n\nthe script was injected and how the server displays that data the script could be stored permanently on the target\n\nserver. XSS scripts may also be reflected, typically sent in links, where they are only used for one session.\n\nTo mitigate XSS risks, it is important that a web developer sanitize their inputs.

FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

CSRF {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__csrf}\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) involves using an victims already authenticated session in a request that is not part\n\nof that session. Imagine you are logged into Twitter. An attacker sends you a form link in GMail, that when clicked on\n\nposts a tweet that says, \\\"I'm a CSRF victim.\\\" Assuming Twitter accepts the form submission you will now have a tweet\n\nin your timeline that states \\\"I'm a CSRF victim.\\\"\n\nThis is probably the most benign scenario, you can imagine things be much worse with an online banking application. The\n\nsolution is for the website (Twitter in this case) to use a CSRF token (which it does). When the form is generated, a\n\nrandom value is included as a hidden input. That random, hidden input is the CSRF token. When a submission is made, if\n\nthe CSRF token submitted does not match the one created for the form (which only the valid website knows) the submission\n\nis not accepted.\n\nCSRF tokens are yet another example of how web applications require proactive security as opposed to being secure by\n\ndesign. Most web apps are employing them, but it can be easy for a developer to forget.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.5.3. SSRF\"}\n",

The attacker gives the victim a bogus certificate authority (CA) certificate which the victim\n\ninstalls. This is often accomplished via a trojan. Then the attacker places themselves in the middle of an uninitiated\n\nsecure connection. During the key exchange the attacker creates a custom certificate signed by a bogus CA for the\n\nconnection between attacker and victim. The attacker also makes an actual HTTPS connection to the service and proxies\n\ndata for the victim. All of the victims data will show up in plaintext for the attacker but the connection will appear\n\nto be secure for the victim. This is used in the [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler){.link} debugging proxy to\n\ndecrypt HTTPS traffic and is also used in some network appliances that perform deep packet inspection.\n\nAnother MitM attack on SSL is simply to maintain or downgrade to an HTTP connection with the victim and proxy data to an\n\nactual HTTPS connection with the server.

It focuses on organizing topics such as introduction, cryptography, malware, protocols, attacks, security solutions, access controls, vulnerability management, incident response, virtualization, mobile solutions, and more across different weeks. There is no detailed discussion or explanation of cryptographic methods themselves.\n\nSince the context does not provide meaningful, coherent, or educationally valuable content related to the topic of cryptographic methods, it would be inappropriate to generate a question-answer pair based on this information alone.

[Linux\n\nnamespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html){.link} controlled by\n\n[cgroups](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html){.link} allow a daemon (Docker, podman, etc.) to make an\n\nenvironment where the application has limited access to the full system. Typically containers are used to run a single\n\napplication as if it were running all by itself on an actual host. This makes it easier to deploy the unique\n\nenvironments that some applications require.\n\nThe obvious security concern lies in the isolation.

When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes. In a case of \\\"everything old is new again\\\" this isn't true.

Once it has two codes recorded,\n\npresumably from the victim pressing the button multiple times, it stops jamming, sends out the first code to unlock the\n\ncar and stores the second code to unlock the car at a later time.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.10.

They are typically marketed as either stand-alone devices,\n\nsoftware to install on internal devices, or a subscription service that routes traffic through an external appliance. In\n\nthe age of cloud computing network security as a service is becoming increasingly popular.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.1. Firewall\"}\n\n\n### 6.3.1. Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

In this scenario users on either campus expect to be\n\nable to connect securely to services on the opposite campus at all times.

This may be as simple as noting in a log file when a user has\n\nlogged in to keeping track of exactly which services and user uses and how long they use them. Accounting is incredibly\n\nimportant because it allows you to not only monitor for possible problems, but also inspect what has occurred *after* a\n\nproblem is encountered.

Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted.

The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops.

They are typically marketed as either stand-alone devices,\n\nsoftware to install on internal devices, or a subscription service that routes traffic through an external appliance. In\n\nthe age of cloud computing network security as a service is becoming increasingly popular.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.1. Firewall\"}\n\n\n### 6.3.1. Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.  [User accesses a sevice]{.principal}\n\n2.  [User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request]{.principal}\n\n3.  [User logs in]{.principal}\n\n4.  [Credentials are verified]{.principal}\n\n5.  [SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one. The following diagram\n\nhighlights the differences between OpenID authentication and an OAuth flow:\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/oauth.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"oauth\" />\n\n</div>\n\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">OpenID vs. Pseudo-Authentication using OAuth</a> by <a\n\nhref=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\" class=\"link\">Perhelion</a>\n\nused under <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">CC0 1.0</a></figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.10.

    "context": "### 4.4.9. DNS {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__dns}\nDomain Name System (DNS) is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses. Domain names are the simple names people are\n\naccustomed to for websites, such as `njit.edu`{.literal} as opposed to `54.83.189.142`{.literal}. Names are\n\nsignificantly easier for people to remember than IP addresses. In order for a computer to resolve a name, it first\n\nqueries a local cache, then its primary DNS server. Assuming the DNS server cannot find the name it will query a Root\n\nserver for a Top Level Domain (TLD) server, which maintains a listing of Authoritative Nameservers for that particular\n\ndomain (edu, com, net, org, gov, etc.). Finally once an authoritative nameserver is found it will respond with the IP\n\naddress for that particular hostname which will be cached and sent back through the user's primary DNS server to the\n\nuser.\n\nDNS is designed to be resilient and decentralized but unfortunately the traffic is not authenticated or encrypted. This\n\nhas made it a target for MitM attacks. Likewise cache hits and misses [can yield information as to what names have been\n\nrecently resolved](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00509){.link} (as was the case in discovering the extent of the Sony\n\nRootkit). The recursive nature has of DNS has also allowed for DoS attacks in the past, but much of that has been solved\n\nby limiting recursive queries to the user-facing DNS servers (ie. the one given to you by your DHCP request).

Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

Lab: Scanning with nmap {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_scanning_with_nmap}\nFor this lab we will start by downloading and extracting the files required. Download\n\n[nmap.zip](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/nmap.zip){.link} and extract it to a directory you can access\n\nfrom the shell. Open a shell in that directory (it should have a `docker-compose.yml`{.literal} in it and a\n\n`victim`{.literal} and `scanner`{.literal} directory). Since we will be simulating multiple machines in this lab, we\n\nwill make use of Docker Compose which was already installed with Docker. Docker Compose reads a\n\n`docker-compose.yml`{.literal} file which should already be in your `nmap`{.literal} directory. Run\n\n`docker-compose up --build --detach`{.literal} to build and run the images in the background:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>PS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\temp\\nmap&gt;

TGTs are the cornerstone\n\nof Kerberos security and the Golden Ticket exploit targets them specifically.\n\nUsing the fully qualified domain name, security identifier, username of an account, and a KRBTGT password hash an\n\nattacker can create their own TGTs that will grant access to services. The KRBTGT account is an account that Windows\n\nmachines use to perform Kerberos administrative tasks. The KRBTGT password hash can be obtained from any machine where\n\nthat account was used if the attacker has complete access to the files on the hard drive. This may be done with physical\n\naccess or through the use of malware on a victim machine.\n\nAn attacker will only be able to forge TGTs until the KRBTGT account password is changed, [so a common remediation\n\nstrategy is to change the\n\npassword](https://blog.quest.com/what-is-krbtgt-and-why-should-you-change-the-password/){.link}.

Learning the Lingo {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__learning_the_lingo}\nIn general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary. Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2. AAA\"}\n",

Imagine you are logged into Twitter. An attacker sends you a form link in GMail, that when clicked on\n\nposts a tweet that says, \\\"I'm a CSRF victim.\\\" Assuming Twitter accepts the form submission you will now have a tweet\n\nin your timeline that states \\\"I'm a CSRF victim.\\\"\n\nThis is probably the most benign scenario, you can imagine things be much worse with an online banking application. The\n\nsolution is for the website (Twitter in this case) to use a CSRF token (which it does). When the form is generated, a\n\nrandom value is included as a hidden input. That random, hidden input is the CSRF token. When a submission is made, if\n\nthe CSRF token submitted does not match the one created for the form (which only the valid website knows) the submission\n\nis not accepted.\n\nCSRF tokens are yet another example of how web applications require proactive security as opposed to being secure by\n\ndesign.

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal. [Please follow these directions for installing\n\nDocker.](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/){.link} For Windows you can use the [Windows Terminal\n\napp](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701){.link} and in MacOS you can use the preinstalled\n\nTerminal app. Gray boxes show the commands as typed into the terminal with typical output where possible.

Most Linux\n\ndistributions include a simple utility for creating an MD5 hash based on a file's contents. This command is named\n\nmd5sum. Typically this is used to detect if a file has been tampered with.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist. We will tell it to use the default\n\nwordlist to try and determine what the password is that matches karl's hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal}:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@8e0962021f85:/# john --format=crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst /etc/shadow\n\nLoaded 1 password hash (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])\n\nPress &#39;q&#39; or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status\n\n&lt;karl&#39;s password&gt;             (karl)\n\n1g 0:00:00:01 100% 0.6211g/s 178.8p/s 178.8c/s 178.8C/s lacrosse..pumpkin\n\nUse the &quot;--show&quot; option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably\n\nSession completed</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n<aside class=\"admonition note\" title=\"Note\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nOnce john has cracked a password it will not show it if you run it again.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed. These tables may take up terabytes of disk space, but can make cracking even complicated hashes much simpler.\n\n<p>\n\nLet's use a custom utility named\n\n<code class=\"literal\">\n\n[\\`crypt`</code>`{=html}](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/blob/main/labs/hash/crypt.c){.link} to show that we have the\n\nactual password. This utility is already installed on your container. We will start by printing out just the line in\n\n`/etc/shadow`{.literal} that has karl's info.

The next part of the shadown line, immediately following the\n\nfirst colon, is the hash information. The characters in between the first set of `$`{.literal} is the version of the\n\nhashing algorithm being used, `y`{.literal} for yescrypt in our case. The characters in between the second set of\n\n`$`{.literal} are the parameters passed to yescrypt which will always be `j9T`{.literal} for us. The characters in\n\nbetween the third set of `$`{.literal} is your salt.

DHCP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__dhcp}\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to allow new clients on a network to obtain an IP address and\n\ninformation about services provided. IPv4 addresses can be thought of as being in two groups: static addresses and\n\ndynamic addresses. Dynamic addresses are distributed by a DHCP server for a particular lease time. When the time is up,\n\nthe DHCP server may distribute the address to another client. DHCP servers can also give information about proxies,\n\nDomain Name Servers (DNS), gateways and even where to get a [where to get a kernel to boot an OS over the\n\nnetwork!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment){.link}\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of modern networks, with clients coming and going, DHCP is the standard. From a security\n\nstandpoint someone impersonating a DHCP server can wreak havoc on a network. These rogue DHCP servers can cause traffic\n\nto be redirected to initiate MitM attacks or cause DoS attacks.

For example it is much easier for a computer to multiply large\n\nnumbers than to determine the factors of large numbers. This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm.
