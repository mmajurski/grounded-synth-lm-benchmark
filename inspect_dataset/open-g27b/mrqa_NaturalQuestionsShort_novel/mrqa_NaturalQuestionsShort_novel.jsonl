The table is clean and readily usable for quantitative analysis. The question topic focuses on the limitations of using total medal count as a sole evaluation metric, which is relevant as the table *primarily* presents data in this manner. The context doesn't explicitly discuss biases, so a good question will require the expert to *infer* these limitations based on the presented data.

The question topic asks about statistical significance, which is a valid and challenging line of inquiry given the data.
