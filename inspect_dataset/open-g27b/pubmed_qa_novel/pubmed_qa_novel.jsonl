Group 1 (recurrent spontaneous abortion) consisted of 357 women with 2 or more spontaneous losses. In group 2 (infertility), there were 349 subjects from infertility practices recruited at the time of a positive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Group 3 (spontaneous abortion) women (n = 81) were recruited at the time of an ultrasound diagnosis of an embryonic demise or an anembryonic gestation. Groups 4 (primiparous) and 5 (multiparous) were healthy pregnant subjects previously enrolled in another study to determine the incidence and cause of pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. The Primiparous group included 114 women in their first pregnancy, whereas the Multiparous group consisted of 79 women with 2 or more pregnancies but without pregnancy loss.\n\nThe rate of extreme skewing (90% or greater) in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population was 8.6%, and not statistically different from any of the other groups, except the Primiparous group (1.0%, P<.01). The incidence of X-inactivation skewing of 90% or greater was no different whether there had been at least 1 live birth (9.9%), or no previous live births and at least 3 losses (5.6%, P>.05).

    "context": "Reconstruction of the joint line is crucial in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A routine height of tibial cut to maintain the natural joint line may compromise the preservation of the PCL. Since the PCL footprint is not accessible prior to tibial osteotomy, it seems beneficial to identify a reliable extraarticular anatomic landmark for predicting the PCL footprint and being visible within standard TKA approach. The fibula head predicts reliably the location of PCL footprint; however, it is not accessible during TKA. The aim of this study now was to analyze whether the tibial tuberosity can serve as a reliable referencing landmark to estimate the PCL footprint height prior to tibial cut.\n\nThe first consecutive case series included 216 CR TKA. Standing postoperative lateral view radiographs were utilized to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and tibial osteotomy plane. In the second case series, 223 knee MRIs were consecutively analyzed to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and PCL footprint. The probability of partial or total PCL removal was calculated for different vertical distances between tibial tuberosity and tibial cutting surface.\n\nThe vertical distance between the tibial tuberosity and tibial cut averaged 24.7 \u00b1 4 mm. The average vertical distance from tibial tuberosity to proximal and to distal PCL footprint was found to be 22 \u00b1 4.4 and 16 \u00b1 4.4 mm, respectively.

It presents data on the average distance between the tibial tuberosity and tibial cut, as well as the distances to the proximal and distal PCL footprints. The study aims to determine if the tibial tuberosity can reliably estimate the PCL footprint height.\n2. **Concept Exploration:** The core concept revolves around using an extra-articular landmark (tibial tuberosity) to predict an intra-articular structure's (PCL footprint) position during surgery.

However, surgeons with such training and experience may not always be available to all patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trauma training affects the post-operative difference in femoral version (DFV) following IMN.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2009, 417 consecutive patients with diaphyseal femur fractures (AO/OTA 32A-C) were treated via IMN. Inclusion criteria for this study included complete baseline and demographic documentation as well as pre-operative films for fracture classification and post-operative CT scanogram (per institutional protocol) for version and length measurement of both the nailed and uninjured femurs. Exclusion criteria included bilateral injuries, multiple ipsilateral lower extremity fractures, previous injury, and previous deformity. Of the initial 417 subjects, 355 patients met our inclusion criteria. Other data included in our analysis were age, sex, injury mechanism, open vs. closed fracture, daytime vs. nighttime surgery, mechanism of injury, and AO and Winquist classifications. Post-operative femoral version of both lower extremities was measured on CT scanogram by an orthopaedic trauma fellowship trained surgeon. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine statistically significant risk factors for malrotation between the two cohorts.\n\nOverall, 80.3% (288/355) of all fractures were fixed by trauma-trained surgeons. The mean post-operative DFV was 8.7\u00b0 in these patients, compared to 10.7\u00b0 in those treated by surgeons of other subspecialties. This difference was not statistically significant when accounting for other factors in a multivariate model (p>0.05). The same statistical trend was true when analyzing outcomes of only the more severe Winquist type III and IV fractures. Additionally, surgeon experience was not significantly predictive of post-operative version for either trauma or non-trauma surgeons (p>0.05 for both).\n\n",

Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime.\n\nWe used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts.

It was the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS.\n\nThe records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 3 Doppler waveform types.\n\nSSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 11 (22%) cases.

If this mechanism is important, the association of maternal body mass index (BMI) with offspring BMI should be stronger than the association of paternal with offspring BMI.\n\nTo compare the relative strengths of association of maternal and paternal BMI with offspring BMI at age 7.5, taking into account the possible effect of non-paternity.\n\nWe compared strength of association for maternal-offspring and paternal-offspring BMI for 4654 complete parent-offspring trios in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), using unstandardised and standardised regression analysis. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of non-paternity on these associations.\n\nThe strength of association between parental BMI and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar for both parents. Taking into account correlations between maternal and paternal BMI, performing standardised rather than unstandardised regression and carrying out a sensitivity analysis for non-paternity emphasised the robustness of the general similarity of the associations.

Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration.

We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications.\n\nFentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl.\n\n48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5\u2009ng/ml, (range 0.5\u2009ng/ml to\u2009>40\u2009ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9\u2009ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3\u2009ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1\u2009ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22\u2009ng/ml and 20\u2009ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected.\n\nThe lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2\u2009ng/ml) in apparent non-na\u00efve opiate abusers.

They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity.\n\nWe used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections.\n\nWe have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons.

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\n\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.\n\n",

This is a direct consequence of impaired zonular support and thus, phacodonesis. The differential change in ACD offers a potential non-invasive method to assess phacodonesis.",

It details response rates, awareness of storage conditions, thermometer usage, and, crucially, temperature excursions observed during monitoring. The focus is on deviations from optimal storage temperatures.\n2. **Concept Exploration:** The study highlights a significant issue: a lack of adherence to proper vaccine storage guidelines, leading to potential vaccine degradation and reduced efficacy. The temperature excursions are a direct indicator of this problem. The mention of specialized refrigerators with thermostats suggests an attempt at better control, but even these weren't foolproof.\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration:** Difficulty: 8/10. The question requires understanding the specific findings regarding temperature excursions \u2013 both subzero and elevated \u2013 and calculating the proportion of monitored fridges experiencing issues.

We investigated the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of PVE in patients with both mitral and aortic prosthesis and the safety of single-valve replacement when only one valve seemed infected.\n\nPatients with a diagnosis of active PVE who had mitral and aortic prosthesis in place were assessed. We looked at the methods for diagnosis, causative agents, indication for valve replacement, operative findings and outcome.\n\nTwenty patients, who had both mitral and aortic prostheses and a diagnosis of PVE, were assessed. Streptococci and staphylococci caused 70% of cases. By means of echocardiography, the valves involved were: mitral (11 patients), aortic (six patients), and in three cases both prosthetic valves seemed infected. Surgery was undertaken in 17 patients (85%). The positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%. In 13 patients, only the prosthetic valve that seemed infected was replaced. Four of these patients died within a week after the procedure. Nine patients survived the surgical procedure, completed a course of antimicrobial therapy and were followed up for 15.78 months (95% CI: 12.83-18.72).
