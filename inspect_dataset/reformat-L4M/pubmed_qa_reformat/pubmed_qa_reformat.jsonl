    "orig_question": "Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?",
    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT]\u00a0<9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM.\n\nWe performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes.\n\nWe found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values).\n\n",

    "context": "To examine the effect of a weekend hospitalization on the timing and incidence of intensive cardiac procedures, and on subsequent expenditures, mortality and readmission rates for Medicare patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n\nThe primary data are longitudinal, administrative claims for 922,074 elderly, non-rural, fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with AMI from 1989 to 1998. Annual patient-level cohorts provide information on ex ante health status, procedure use, expenditures, and health outcomes.\n\nThe patient is the primary unit of analysis. I use ordinary least squares regression to estimate the effect of weekend hospitalization on rates of cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery (in various time periods subsequent to the initial hospitalization), 1-year expenditures and rates of adverse health outcomes in various periods following the AMI admission.\n\nWeekend AMI patients are significantly less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures, and experience significantly higher rates of adverse health outcomes. Weekend admission leads to a 3.47 percentage point reduction in catheterization at 1 day, a 1.52 point reduction in angioplasty, and a 0.35 point reduction in by-pass surgery (p<.001 in all cases). The primary effect is delayed treatment, as weekend-weekday procedure differentials narrow over time from the initial hospitalization. Weekend patients experience a 0.38 percentage point (p<.001) increase in 1-year mortality and a 0.20 point (p<.001) increase in 1-year readmission with congestive heart failure.\n\n",

The analysis reveals that weekend AMI patients are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality and readmission rates. The data suggests that the primary effect of weekend admission is delayed treatment, as the differentials in procedures between weekend and weekday admissions narrow over time. The findings indicate a 3.47 percentage point reduction in catheterization at 1 day, a 1.52 point reduction in angioplasty, and a 0.35 point reduction in bypass surgery for weekend admissions. Moreover, weekend patients experience a 0.38 percentage point increase in 1-year mortality and a 0.20 point increase in 1-year readmission with congestive heart failure. These results imply that the care provided to AMI patients admitted on weekends is associated with worse health outcomes.\n\nTo address the question of whether hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends, we must consider the implications of the findings. The original question is somewhat simplistic and does not directly reflect the nuanced analysis presented in the context. A more thoughtful engagement with the topic would involve rephrasing the question to capture the essence of the investigation.\n\nThe thought process involves understanding that the context does not directly state that hospitals provide \"lower quality care\" on weekends but indicates significant differences in treatment timing and outcomes for AMI patients admitted on weekends versus weekdays.

    "context": "Cerebral hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure undergone to control intractable seizures, is becoming a standard procedure with more cases identified and treated early in life [33]. While the effect of the dominant hemisphere resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.\n\nSeven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2].\n\nWe found that about 60% of our group developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range. Phonological processing measured by both phonological awareness and nonword reading was unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants. Phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory, a component of phonological processing skills, together with receptive vocabulary size, positively correlated with reading levels similar to those reported in average readers.

However, there is some uncertainty about gender differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single individuals and about the impact of living arrangements.\n\nLongitudinal data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category.\n\nThe benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone.

Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial.\n\nA retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone.\n\nThe two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical d\u00e9bridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients.

Additionally, the HBO group required more surgical d\u00e9bridements (3.3 vs 1.5) and had a slightly shorter average length of hospitalization for survivors, though this difference was not statistically significant.

BQ123 (3 or 6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 minutes before and 2 hours after the first cerulein injection.\n\nAcute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in all rats treated with cerulin + stress. The score for pancreatic hemorrhage was 2.4 +/- 0.2 in this group. In the rats pretreated with BQ123, the score was reduced to 1.0 +/- 0.0, pancreas wet weight and serum amylase activity were significantly reduced, and histologic alterations in the pancreas lightened, also the local pancreatic blood flow improved without affecting the systemic blood pressure.\n\n",

    "context": "To assess whether eligibility to an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol in itself represents a good prognostic factor after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.\n\nBetween April 1984 and May 1989, our institution entered 35 patients with invasive bladder cancer into the Swiss Group for Clinical and Epidemiological Cancer Research (SAKK) study 09/84. They were randomly assigned to either observation or three postoperative courses of cisplatin monotherapy after cystectomy. This study had a negative result. The outcome of these 35 patients (protocol group) was compared with an age- and tumor-stage-matched cohort (matched group; n = 35) who also underwent cystectomy during the same period, but were not entered into the SAKK study, as well as the remaining 57 patients treated during the study period for the same indication (remaining group).\n\nMedian overall survival decreased from 76.3 months in the protocol group to 52.1 months in the matched group and to 20.3 months in the remaining group. The respective times of median recurrence-free survival were 67.2, 16.0, and 9.4 months. Tumor progression occurred in 46% of the protocol group compared with 69% in the matched group and 65% in the remaining group (P<.05).

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "It is now widely accepted that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical regulator of energy homeostasis. Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.\n\nAll the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05).\n\n",

    "context": "A side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). It was the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS.\n\nThe records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 3 Doppler waveform types.\n\nSSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 11 (22%) cases. Systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration group (P<.001).\n\n",

The question asks whether the blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of steal in subclavian steal syndrome.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given context\nThe study analyzed 1860 patient records and found 51 cases of SSS. It categorized vertebral artery waveforms into three types: systolic deceleration, alternating flow, and complete reversal. The study compared the blood pressure difference between the normal and lesion sides across these waveform types.\n\n## Step 3: Identify relevant information for the question\nThe key finding relevant to the question is that the systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration group (P<.001). This indicates a relationship between the severity of steal (as indicated by the waveform types) and the blood pressure difference.\n\n## Step 4: Relate the information to the question\nThe severity of steal can be inferred from the vertebral artery waveform types, with complete reversal indicating a more severe steal than systolic deceleration.

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a common condition which presents in infants at 2-12 weeks of postnatal life, and whose cause remains obscure. Multiple associated abnormalities have been recognized within the external hypertrophied pyloric muscle layer, but the internal component of the pyloric mucosa has received scant attention in the literature to date. Our purpose in this study was to show that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, to discuss its possible cause, and to explore the hypothesis of a relationship between pyloric mucosal redundancy and the development of IHPS.\n\nWe identified 102 consecutive infants with surgically confirmed IHPS and determined the thickness of the pyloric mucosa compared with the thickness of the surrounding hypertrophied muscle. Fifty-one infants who did not have pyloric stenosis served as controls.\n\nMean mucosal thickness in patients with IHPS approximated mean muscle thickness, with a ratio of 0.89. In infants with IHPS, the pyloric mucosa constitutes approximately one third of the cross-sectional diameter of the pyloric mass and fills and obstructs the pyloric canal.\n\n",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provided discusses a study on Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS), focusing on the role of pyloric mucosal redundancy in the condition. The study compares the thickness of the pyloric mucosa to the surrounding hypertrophied muscle in infants with IHPS and those without. It is found that in infants with IHPS, the pyloric mucosa is significantly thick and constitutes a substantial portion of the pyloric mass, suggesting a potential role in the obstruction of the pyloric canal. The question \"In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role?\" implies an investigation into whether the observed pyloric mucosal hypertrophy has a causal relationship with the development of IHPS. The answer \"yes\" suggests that there is an etiologic role, meaning the hypertrophy is not just a coincidental finding but potentially contributes to the condition.\n\nTo rephrase and reformat this question and answer pair according to the given guidelines, we need to analyze the content deeply and understand the implications of the study's findings.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The study highlights the significant contribution of pyloric mucosal thickness to the overall pyloric mass in IHPS, suggesting it plays a role in the obstruction.\n   \n2. **Concept Exploration**: The concept here involves understanding the potential etiologic role of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in IHPS.

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "Arterial catheters are routinely used to sample blood for clotting studies in most cardiothoracic intensive care units. The clotting profile in surgical bleeding after cardiac surgery influences further management. Aspiration and discard of a certain amount of blood from the line, prior to sampling, are assumed to clear heparin contamination. We have investigated this assumption through analysis of the clotting profile by simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous samples.\n\nThe morning following cardiac surgery, simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous blood samples were taken for activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and international normalized ratio (INR) in 49 randomly selected patients. Also, a thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) (n = 7) was made. A survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units was carried out to determine the practice for the withdrawal of blood for clotting studies.\n\nThe median arterial APTT ratio value was 1.32 +/- 0.52 as compared to the median peripheral APTT ratio value which was 1.1 +/- 0.24 (P<0.001). INR values were statistically similar by both routes. Heparin contamination was confirmed by TEG which revealed that the R-value for arterial catheter blood samples without heparinase in the cup was higher (406.00 +/- 64.44 s) compared with the value for arterial samples with heparinase in the cup (318.28 +/- 47.26s, P<0.05).

It investigates whether aspirating and discarding a certain amount of blood before sampling clears heparin contamination from the arterial line. The question asks if we can rely on arterial line sampling for performing activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) after cardiac surgery.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given information\nThe study found a significant difference between the median APTT ratio values obtained from arterial lines (1.32 +/- 0.52) and peripheral venous samples (1.1 +/- 0.24), with P<0.001. This indicates that the APTT ratio values from arterial lines are not similar to those from peripheral venous samples. Additionally, thromboelastogram (TEG) analysis confirmed heparin contamination in arterial catheter blood samples.\n\n## Step 3: Relate the analysis to the question\nThe difference in APTT ratio values and the confirmation of heparin contamination in arterial samples suggest that arterial line sampling may not provide accurate results for APTT due to heparin contamination.\n\n## Step 4: Formulate a rewritten question and answer\nTo rephrase the question and maintain semantic equivalence, we need to ensure it still queries the reliability of using arterial line samples for APTT after cardiac surgery.

    "context": "Reimbursement based on the total care of a patient during an acute episode of illness is believed to stimulate management and clinicians to reduce quality problems like waiting times and poor coordination of care delivery. Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a process-oriented way of working.\n\nData for this study were gathered during the winter of 2007/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted.\n\nSEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes by the use of process-oriented performance measures.

Demographic profiles as well as operative data were analyzed, and the patients were prospectively followed. Patient's functional status and quality of life were assessed with the Barthel Index, New York Heart Association class and the short form-12 questionnaire.\n\nThe mean age of the study group (61 men, 23 women) was 81.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 years. Most redo-procedures were carried out after primary coronary artery bypass grafting (65%), primary aortic valve replacement (21%) and primary mitral valve replacement (6%). The most frequent actual surgical procedures were combined coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement (26%), isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (19%), and isolated aortic valve replacement (19%). The mean length of hospital stay was 17\u2009\u00b1\u200915 days. In-hospital mortality counted for 32.1%. During follow up (29\u2009\u00b1\u200920 months) a further 19.0% of the patients died.

    "context": "This study was designed to determine whether preclerkship performance examinations could accurately identify medical students at risk for failing a senior clinical performance examination (CPE).\n\nThis study used a retrospective case-control, multiyear design, with contingency table analyses, to examine the performance of 412 students in the classes of 2005 to 2010 at a midwestern medical school. During their second year, these students took four CPEs that each used three standardized patient (SP) cases, for a total of 12 cases. The authors correlated each student's average year 2 case score with the student's average case score on a senior (year 4) CPE. Contingency table analysis was carried out using performance on the year 2 CPEs and passing/failing the senior CPE. Similar analyses using each student's United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores were also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, odds ratio, and relative risk were calculated for two year 2 performance standards.\n\nStudents' low performances relative to their class on the year 2 CPEs were a strong predictor that they would fail the senior CPE.

    "orig_question": "Does a febrile reaction to platelets predispose recipients to red blood cell alloimmunization?",
    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "A variable effect of inflammation on alloimmunization to transfused red blood cells (RBCs) in mice has been recently reported. We investigated whether RBC alloimmunization in humans was affected by transfusion of blood products in temporal proximity to experiencing a febrile transfusion reaction (FTR) to platelets (PLTs), an event predominantly mediated by inflammatory cytokines.\n\nBlood bank databases were used to identify patients who experienced an FTR or possible FTR to PLTs from August 2000 to March 2008 (FTR group). The control group of patients received a PLT transfusion on randomly selected dates without experiencing an FTR. The \"event\" was defined as the PLT transfusion that caused the FTR in the FTR group or the index PLT transfusion in the control group. The number of transfused blood products and their proximity to the event were recorded along with other recipient data. The primary endpoint was the rate of RBC alloimmunization between the two groups.\n\nThere were 190 recipients in the FTR group and 245 in the control group. Overall, the recipients in the control group were younger and received more blood products on the day of their event and over the subsequent 10 days. The alloimmunization rate among recipients in the FTR group was higher than in the control group (8% vs. 3%, respectively; p = 0.026).\n\n",
    "response": "## Step 1: Analyze the given context to understand the relationship between febrile transfusion reactions (FTRs) to platelets and red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization.\nThe context discusses a study investigating whether RBC alloimmunization in humans is affected by the transfusion of blood products in temporal proximity to experiencing an FTR to PLTs. It compares the rate of RBC alloimmunization between patients who experienced an FTR (FTR group) and those who did not (control group) during PLT transfusions.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key findings of the study as presented in the context.\nThe study found that the alloimmunization rate among recipients in the FTR group was higher than in the control group (8% vs. 3%, respectively), with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.026). This indicates that experiencing an FTR is associated with a higher rate of RBC alloimmunization.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the original question and answer to understand their content and how they relate to the context provided.\nThe original question asks if a febrile reaction to platelets predisposes recipients to RBC alloimmunization, and the answer is \"yes\". This directly relates to the study's findings on the association between FTRs and RBC alloimmunization rates.\n\n## Step 4: Rephrase the question to ensure it is clear, detailed, and semantically equivalent to the original question, while also being answerable by a domain expert without the context.\nTo rephrase the question, we need to incorporate relevant details from the context that are necessary for understanding the question without referencing the original context. The rephrased question should still be about the relationship between febrile reactions to platelet transfusions and the development of RBC alloimmunization.\n\n## Step 5: Develop a multiple-choice question based on the rephrased question, ensuring the answer options are distinct, unambiguous, and one of them is the correct answer as per the original answer.\nGiven that the original answer is \"yes\", we need to formulate answer options that reflect this. A possible rephrased question could be: \"Is there an association between experiencing a febrile transfusion reaction to platelets and an increased risk of red blood cell alloimmunization in transfusion recipients?\" The answer options could then be framed as affirmative or negative statements regarding this association.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the answer options and select the correct answer based on the study's findings.\nThe correct answer, based on the study's findings, should reflect that there is an association between FTRs and an increased risk of RBC alloimmunization. Thus, the correct answer should be an affirmation of this association.\n\n## Step 7: Formulate the final output in the required format, including the question, answer options, explanation, and correct answer.\nLet's rephrase the question to: \"Is experiencing a febrile transfusion reaction to platelets associated with a higher rate of red blood cell alloimmunization?\" The answer options will be: A: Yes, the rate is significantly higher.

The answer provided is \"yes.\"\n\nThe context clearly supports this affirmation by stating that both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion influence suicide mortality rates among both males and females. Thus, the question and answer are relevant and grounded in the context.\n\nTo rephrase and rewrite the question and answer according to the guidelines, we need to create a more complex and thought-provoking query that still aligns with the original intent. The question should be self-contained, clear, and challenging for a domain expert.\n\nUpon examining the context, it's evident that the study's findings on the influence of social exclusion dimensions on suicide mortality are nuanced, involving different effects on males and females. Therefore, a more detailed and insightful question can be formulated.\n\nThe complexity of the question is calibrated to be around 7 out of 10, as it requires understanding the relationship between social exclusion dimensions and suicide mortality without being overly straightforward.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Does the analysis of social exclusion dimensions, specifically 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare', reveal a significant influence on suicide mortality rates among European populations, and is this influence consistent across genders?\nA: Yes, both dimensions significantly influence suicide mortality, with a consistent negative influence across genders.\nB: No, the dimensions do not significantly influence suicide mortality rates, and there is no consistency across genders.\nC: The influence is significant only for males, with 'economic/employment' having a stronger effect.\nD: The 'social/welfare' dimension has a significant influence only on female suicide mortality rates.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is supported by the context, which states that both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions negatively influence suicide mortality among males and females, though the strength of influence varies by gender.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.\n\nHistological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT.\n\n",

The original question is straightforward and seeks a yes or no answer regarding the role of chemokine production by pWAT in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. To enhance it, we can frame a question that still captures this essence but invites deeper reflection.\n\nThe thought process involves understanding the context's central idea\u2014that pWAT's production of chemokines is linked to the development or exacerbation of atherosclerosis\u2014and crafting a question that requires a nuanced understanding of this relationship.

(ii) To test the hypothesis that this relationship could be explained by: (a) reporting of psychological factors, (b) common association of self-reported mechanical factors with other unexplained syndromes.\n\nA population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a variety of self-reported mechanical factors: teeth grinding, facial trauma, missing teeth and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly. Information was also collected on demographic factors, psychological factors and the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes.\n\nAn adjusted response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-2.9) were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors. However, these factors were also commonly associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), facial trauma (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.6).\n\n",

It also investigates whether this relationship can be explained by psychological factors or the common association of these mechanical factors with other unexplained syndromes. The study found that teeth grinding and facial trauma were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain even after adjusting for psychological factors. However, these mechanical factors were also associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The study implies that the relationship between mechanical factors and chronic oro-facial pain might not be entirely explained by the mechanical factors themselves but could be related to a broader tendency to report unexplained symptoms, often referred to as somatisation. Somatisation is the tendency to experience and report physical symptoms that are not explained by a medical condition.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The question requires understanding the implications of the study's findings regarding the relationship between mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain and somatisation.

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Whether mutation status should be used to guide therapy is an important issue in many cancers. We correlated mutation profile in radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) metastatic thyroid cancers (TCs) with patient outcome and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and discussed the results with other published data.\n\nOutcome in 82 consecutive patients with metastatic RAIR thyroid carcinoma prospectively tested for BRAF, RAS and PI3KCA mutations was retrospectively analyzed, including 55 patients treated with multikinase inhibitors.\n\nPapillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) were the most frequent histological subtype (54.9 %), followed by poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma [PDTC] (30.5 %) and follicular thyroid carcinoma [FTC](14.6 %). A genetic mutation was identified in 23 patients (28 %) and BRAF was the most frequently mutated gene (23 %). Median progression-free survival (PFS) on first-line TKI treatment was 14.6 months (95% CI 9.9-18.4). BRAF mutation positively influenced median PFS, both in the entire TKI-treated cohort (median PFS 34.7 months versus 11.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.29; 95% CI 0.09-0.98; p\u2009=\u20090.03) and in the TKI-treated PTC cohort (n\u2009=\u200922) [log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.086; HR 2.95; 95 % CI 0.81-10.70). However, in TKI-treated patients, PDTC histologic subtype was the only independent prognostic factor for PFS identified in the multivariate analysis (HR 2.36; 95% CI 1.01-5.54; p\u2009=\u20090.048).\n\n",

    "context": "Schools can play an important role in the prevention of obesity, e.g. by providing an environment that stimulates healthy eating habits and by developing a food policy to provide such an environment. The effectiveness of a school food policy is affected by the content of the policy, its implementation and its support by parents, teachers and principals. The aim of this study is to detect opportunities to improve the school food policy and/or implementation at Dutch primary schools. Therefore, this study explores the school food policy and investigates schools' (teachers and principals) and parents' opinion on the school food policy.\n\nData on the schools' perspective of the food policy was collected from principals and teachers by means of semi-structured interviews. In total 74 principals and 72 teachers from 83 Dutch primary schools were interviewed. Data on parental perceptions about the school food policy were based on a cross-sectional survey among 1,429 parents from the same schools.\n\nMost principals (87.1%) reported that their school had a written food policy; however in most cases the rules were not clearly defined. Most of the principals (87.8%) believed that their school paid sufficient attention to nutrition and health. Teachers and principals felt that parents were primarily responsible to encourage healthy eating habits among children, while 49.8% of the parents believed that it is also a responsibility of the school to foster healthy eating habits among children. Most parents reported that they appreciated the school food policy and comply with the food rules. Parents' opinion on the enforcement of the school food policy varied: 28.1% believed that the school should enforce the policy more strongly, 32.1% was satisfied, and 39.8% had no opinion on this topic.\n\n",

An additional advantage of SL is possible biopsy of the nontumorous liver to assess fibrosis/cirrhosis. This study aimed to determine whether SL for patients with HCC still is useful.\n\nPatients with HCC who underwent SL between January 1999 and December 2011 were analyzed. Their demographics, preoperative imaging studies, surgical findings, and histology were assessed.\n\nThe 56 patients (34 men and 22 women; mean age, 60 \u00b1 14 years) in this study underwent SL for assessment of extensive disease or metastases. For two patients, SL was unsuccessful because of intraabdominal adhesions. For four patients (7.1 %), SL showed unresectability because of metastases (n = 1), tumor progression (n = 1), or severe cirrhosis in the contralateral lobe (n = 2). An additional five patients did not undergo laparotomy due to disease progression detected on imaging after SL. Exploratory laparotomy for the remaining 47 patients showed 6 (13 %) additional unresectable tumors due to advanced tumor (n = 5) or nodal metastases (n = 1). Consequently, the yield of SL was 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 3-17 %), and the accuracy was 27 % (95 % CI, 11-52 %).

    "orig_question": "Can shape analysis differentiate free-floating internal carotid artery thrombus from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or transient ischemic attack?",
    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack or stroke may have symptom-related lesions on acute computed tomography angiography (CTA) such as free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT). It is difficult to distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions (\"virtual endarterectomy\"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque.\n\nWe collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 \u00b1 10 years; 10 women, 65.5 \u00b1 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation.\n\nFollow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 \u00b1 0.09. Average accuracy for each classifier ranged from 65.2%-76.4%.\n\n",

Patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors or neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Patient, surgical, and pathologic variables were compared by tumor location. Factors associated with disease-specific survival (DSS) were determined via multivariate analysis.\n\nIn the Korean cohort, significantly more upper third GC (UTG) patients had undifferentiated, diffuse type, and advanced stage cancers compared to lower third GC (LTG) and middle third GC (MTG) patients. In the U.S. cohort, however, T stage was relatively evenly distributed among UTG, MTG, and LTG patients. The independent predictors of DSS in the Korean cohort were T stage, tumor size, retrieved and positive lymph node counts, and age, but in the U.S. cohort, the only independent predictors were T stage and positive lymph node count. Tumor size significantly affected DSS of Korean UTG patients but not U.S. UTG patients.\n\n",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo address the question of whether gastric cancer is different in Korea and the United States, we need to consider various factors such as tumor characteristics, patient demographics, and outcomes after treatment. The provided context offers insights into these aspects by comparing data from Korean and U.S. patients who underwent curative-intent resection for gastric cancer.\n\nThe context reveals several differences between the Korean and U.S. cohorts. For instance, in the Korean cohort, the distribution of gastric cancer by tumor location (upper, middle, or lower third of the stomach) is associated with different pathological characteristics. Specifically, upper third gastric cancers (UTG) in Korean patients are more likely to be undifferentiated, of diffuse type, and at an advanced stage compared to lower third (LTG) and middle third (MTG) gastric cancers. In contrast, the T stage distribution is relatively even across different tumor locations in the U.S. cohort.\n\nMoreover, the factors that predict disease-specific survival (DSS) differ between the two populations. In Korean patients, T stage, tumor size, the number of retrieved and positive lymph nodes, and age are independent predictors of DSS. In U.S. patients, only T stage and positive lymph node count are significant predictors. Notably, tumor size affects the DSS of UTG patients differently in the two countries; it is a significant factor in Korean UTG patients but not in U.S. UTG patients.\n\nThese findings suggest that there are indeed differences in gastric cancer characteristics and prognoses between Korean and U.S. patients, supporting an affirmative answer to the question.\n\nGiven the complexity of the information and the need to reflect nuanced understanding, the question can be rephrased to invite deeper analysis.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What do the differences in tumor characteristics and predictors of disease-specific survival between Korean and U.S. patients suggest about gastric cancer in these two populations?\nA: Gastric cancer is similar in both populations in terms of tumor characteristics and prognosis.\nB: Gastric cancer has different characteristics and prognoses in Korean and U.S. populations.\nC: The prognosis for gastric cancer is better in Korean patients than in U.S. patients.\nD: Tumor location is not a significant factor in determining the prognosis of gastric cancer.\n\nExplanation: The context highlights differences in tumor characteristics and predictors of disease-specific survival between Korean and U.S. patients, indicating that gastric cancer manifests differently in these populations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

    "orig_question": "Women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary: do they have Lynch syndrome?",
    "orig_answer": "maybe",
    "context": "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer; HNPCC) is an autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition syndrome that increases risk for multiple cancers, including colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. Revised Bethesda Criteria recommend that patients with two HNPCC-associated cancers undergo molecular evaluation to determine whether they have a mismatch repair (MMR) defect associated with HNPCC. The purpose of our study was to determine the likelihood of MMR defects (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1) in women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2004, 102 women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers were identified; 59 patients had tumor blocks available for analysis. Patients were divided into risk groups based on family history: high (met Amsterdam criteria), medium (personal history or first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer), and low (all others). Protein expression for MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite instability and MLH1 promoter methylation analyses were performed on a subset of cases.\n\nMedian age was 50 years. Two patients met Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC. Five additional patients, all medium-risk, had molecular findings consistent with a germline mutation of either MSH2 or MLH1. None of the low-risk patients had molecular results consistent with a germline mutation.\n\n",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo address the question of whether women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have Lynch syndrome, we need to consider the information provided in the context. The context discusses a study that aimed to determine the likelihood of mismatch repair (MMR) defects in women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer, which is relevant to diagnosing Lynch syndrome.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context explains that Lynch syndrome is associated with an increased risk of multiple cancers, including colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. It highlights that the study focused on women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers to assess the likelihood of MMR defects, which are indicative of Lynch syndrome.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The study categorized patients into risk groups based on their family history and performed molecular evaluations, including protein expression for MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1, microsatellite instability, and MLH1 promoter methylation analyses. The findings indicated that a small number of patients had molecular results consistent with a germline mutation associated with Lynch syndrome.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The difficulty level of this question is moderate to high because it requires understanding the relationship between synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers and Lynch syndrome, as well as interpreting the study's findings.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: The original question is somewhat open-ended and does not directly lead to a definitive answer based on the provided context. However, it invites reflection on the likelihood of Lynch syndrome in the specified patient group.\n\nThe original question, \"Women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary: do they have Lynch syndrome?\" is followed by an answer \"maybe,\" indicating uncertainty. To rephrase and reformat this according to the guidelines, we need to create a more specific and challenging question that still captures the essence of the original inquiry.\n\nUpon analyzing the context, it's clear that the study provides some evidence that a subset of women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers may have molecular findings consistent with Lynch syndrome, but it's not a universal finding among all such women.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What proportion of women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers are likely to have molecular findings consistent with Lynch syndrome, based on the presence of germline mutations in MMR genes?\nA: The majority of such women have Lynch syndrome.\nB: None of these women have Lynch syndrome.\nC: A small subset of these women may have molecular findings consistent with Lynch syndrome.\nD: All women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers have Lynch syndrome.\n\nExplanation: The study found that out of 59 patients analyzed, 2 met Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC, and 5 additional medium-risk patients had molecular findings consistent with a germline mutation.

Conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared.\n\nSignificant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.933, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), by toluidine blue staining OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.950, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and by dark field OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.667, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2\u00a0mm.

    "context": "Patients diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI) who qualify for nursing home placement tend to require high levels of both psychiatric and nursing care. However, it is unknown whether they are equally likely to be admitted to nursing homes with adequate quality of care compared with other patients.\n\nWe analyzed a national cohort of more than 1.3 million new nursing home admissions in 2007 using the minimum data set. The total and healthcare-related deficiency citations for each facility were obtained from the Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting file. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses determined the association of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with admissions to facilities with higher deficiencies.\n\nCompared with other patients, patients with schizophrenia (n=23,767) tended to enter nursing homes with more total (13.3 vs. 11.2, P<0.001) and healthcare-related deficiencies (8.6 vs. 7.2, P<0.001); and patients with bipolar disorder (n=19,741) were more likely to enter facilities with more problematic care too (12.5 vs. 11.2, P<0.001 for total deficiencies; and 8.2 vs. 7.2, P<0.001 for healthcare-related deficiencies).

The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method.\n\nForty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students.\n\nStatistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78).

The severity of parenchymal inflammation and of interface hepatitis was semiquantitatively graded on a haematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections. Additionally, 50 more HCC, formed on HBV basis, were studied to determine the prevalence of c-kit overexpression.\n\nIn cirrhotic liver, lower intensity of staining and rarely c-kit positivity were present. The greatest number of the c-kit positivity and higher intensity of staining was found in the livers of patients with severe hepatitis and HCC. In chronic hepatitis B infection, the staining intensity was parallel with the grade and stage of the disease. In the areas where fibrosis was seen, c-kit positivity was rare or absent.

The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours.

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "Updated guidelines for the screening and management of cervical cancer in the United States recommend starting Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at age 21 and screening less frequently with less aggressive management for abnormalities. We sought to examine updated Pap test screening guidelines and how they may affect the detection of invasive cervical cancer, especially among women<30 years of age.\n\nPatients diagnosed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with invasive cervical cancer between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively identified. Prior screening history was obtained and patients were divided into two groups based on age<30 years or age \u226530 years. The two groups were then compared with respect to demographics, pathological findings, and time to diagnosis.\n\nA total of 288 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma were identified. Among these patients, 109 had adequate information on prior screening history. Invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) was diagnosed in 37 (33.94%) patients, whereas 64 (58.72%) patients were diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC). The remaining eight patients were diagnosed with other types of cancers of the cervix. A total of 13 patients were younger than 30 while 96 patients were 30 or older. The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of IAC was 15 months in patients younger than 30 years of age compared to 56 months in patients aged 30 and older (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of ISCC was 38 months in patients younger than 30 years of age and 82 months in patients aged 30 and older (p\u2009=\u20090.018).\n\n",

It highlights the differences in the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer among women under 30 and those 30 or older.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the original question and answer\nThe original question is \"Screening History Among Women with Invasive Cervical Cancer in an Academic Medical Center: Will We Miss Cancers Following Updated Guidelines?\" and the answer is \"no\". This question seems to be more of a title or a research question rather than a direct query that can be answered based on the provided context.\n\n## Step 4: Interpret the original question and answer in the context\nThe original question appears to be related to the study's objective or title, and the answer \"no\" suggests that the study or analysis found that updated guidelines would not result in missing cancers. The context provides data on the time from a normal Pap test to the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer, comparing women under 30 to those 30 and older.\n\n## Step 5: Generate a new question based on the context and answer\nTo create a semantically equivalent question, we need to understand the underlying theme of the original question and answer.

The original answer is \"no\", suggesting that the updated guidelines will not result in missing cancers. The closest interpretation in the multiple-choice format is option B, as it aligns with the implication that the updated guidelines are not expected to miss cancers, given the context provided.\n\n## Step 10: Provide the final output in the required format\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Will the implementation of updated Pap test screening guidelines lead to a significant number of invasive cervical cancers being undetected among women under 30 years old?\nA: Yes, because the guidelines recommend less frequent screening.\nB: No, as the data suggests that the time from normal Pap to diagnosis is relatively short, implying that even with less frequent screening, cancers are still detected relatively soon after a normal Pap test.\nC: Maybe, it depends on individual risk factors.\nD: Yes, due to less aggressive management of abnormalities.\nExplanation: The data from the study indicates that while the time from a normal Pap test to diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer is shorter in women under 30, it does not necessarily imply that cancers will be missed.

The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture\u00a0=\u00a040; sham acupuncture\u00a0=\u00a043; and no treatment\u00a0=\u00a034), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture\u00a0=\u00a029; sham acupuncture\u00a0=\u00a033; and no-treatment\u00a0=\u00a022) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture\u00a0=\u00a016; sham acupuncture\u00a0=\u00a015; and no treatment\u00a0=\u00a011).\n\nSignificant improvement in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group.

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora.\n\nFrom 1988 until 1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination.\n\nIn 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen examinations.\n\n",

    "orig_answer": "maybe",
    "context": "Guidelines emphasize that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not a diagnosis of exclusion and encourage clinicians to make a positive diagnosis using the Rome criteria alone. Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers.\n\nWe developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\n\nExperts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most tests as appropriate. Parallel results were found in the C-IBS vignette.\n\n",

Experts were less likely to consider IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion compared to nonexperts (8% vs. 72%). The correct answer should reflect the nuanced understanding that IBS is not considered a diagnosis of exclusion by experts, contrary to the belief held by many nonexperts.\n\nThe original question, \"Is irritable bowel syndrome a diagnosis of exclusion?\" requires a straightforward answer based on the context provided. However, the answer \"maybe\" does not accurately reflect the information given in the context. A more accurate response based on the context would be \"no\" since guidelines emphasize making a positive diagnosis using the Rome criteria alone.\n\nTo create a more challenging and thought-provoking question, we can rephrase it to encourage deeper understanding and reflection.\n\nThought Process:\n1.

We wanted to examine the association between pattern of outpatient care and survival of patients with CHF.\n\nIn a retrospective cohort study conducted with national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) databases, we examined the association between the pattern of outpatient care and survival in 11,661 patients discharged from VA hospitals between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1992, with the primary diagnosis of CHF (cohort 1). Patients were divided into 4 groups, on the basis of their pattern of outpatient care over a 12-month period after discharge: 1) general medicine clinic visits only (GM-only); 2) cardiology clinic visits only (CARD-only); 3) general medicine and cardiology (MIXED) clinic visits; and 4) neither general medicine nor cardiology clinic visits (no-GM/CARD). We used the Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate 1-year survival, controlling for clinical and demographic factors. Consistency of our results was examined by performing identical analysis on a cohort of patients discharged from VHA hospitals between October 1, 1994, and September 30, 1995 (cohort 2, n = 10,141).\n\nThe overall 1-year mortality rate was 23% in the primary cohort. The unadjusted mortality rate was highest for patients in the no-GM/CARD follow up (29%) and lowest for patients in the MIXED group (19%). By use of the MIXED group as reference and adjusting for important clinical and demographic factors, the risk of death (risk ratio [95% CI]) was 1.12 (0.94-1.34) in the CARD-only group, 1.26 (1.15-1.38) in the GM-only group, and 1.48 (1.28-1.72) in the no-GM/CARD group.

Less than 2% of patients treated for cancer of the oral cavity at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) from 1971 to 1997 had primary buccal cancers. Because the majority of these patients did not undergo any adjuvant treatment, this group provided us with the opportunity to assess the relationship between margin status and local recurrence for both small (T1-T2) and large (T3-T4) tumors treated with surgery alone.\n\nThe RPCI tumor registry database reported 104 patients who were treated for buccal carcinoma. A retrospective chart review identified 27 patients who met our criteria for a buccal mucosal primary tumor (epicenter of the mass in the buccal mucosa). There were 13 men and 14 women, ranging in age from 34 to 94 years (mean, 75). Data were collected regarding patient demographics, presenting symptoms, stage, treatment received, and outcome.\n\nAll patients underwent surgical resection of their primary lesion; 21 (75%) had T1 or T2 tumors. The rate of local recurrence was 56% for the group as a whole. Patients with close or positive margins had a 66% local failure rate as compared with 52% when surgical margins were negative (greater than or equal to 5 mm from the resection margin after tissue fixation; P = ns). Among those in whom negative margins were achieved, patients with T1-T2 disease had a 40% local failure rate with surgical resection alone.\n\n",

The answer is \"no\", indicating that these factors are not reliable predictors.\n\n## Step 4: Rephrase the question to be semantically equivalent but clearer and more specific.\nTo rephrase the question, we need to maintain its original meaning while making it more detailed and clear. The rephrased question should be answerable by a domain expert without referencing the original context.\n\n## Step 5: Generate a new question that is semantically equivalent to the original.\nThe new question could be: \"Do margin status and T-stage reliably predict the likelihood of local control in patients with buccal mucosa cancer treated with surgery alone?\"\n\n## Step 6: Develop answer options based on the rephrased question.\nGiven the answer is \"no\", we need to create plausible answer options.

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003.\n\nUsing a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care).\n\nInitially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "To investigate the diagnostic value of a half dose compared with a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine in the assessment of synovitis or tenosynovitis in the wrist and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a disease activity score greater than 3.2.\n\nWith institutional review board approval and informed consent, 57 patients with early RA underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with two different doses of contrast media. The contrast enhancement was measured in inflamed synovial tissue at half dose (0.05 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and at full dose (0.1 mmol/kg) by using T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. The differences and the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. Interrater agreement was assessed by using \u03ba statistics.\n\nA significant difference in SI was found between half-dose and full-dose gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced synovial tissue (mean: 914.35 \u00b1 251.1 vs 1022 \u00b1 244.5, P<.001). Because the SI showed high correlation between the ratio at half dose and full dose (r = 0.875), the formula, ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at full dose = 0.337 + 1.070 \u00d7 ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at half dose, can be used to convert the normalized value of half dose to full dose. However, no difference in RAMRIS (score 0 in 490 of 1026 joints; score 1 in 344; score 2 in 158; and score 3 in 34) or tenosynovitis scores in grading synovitis or tenosynovitis in image quality and in assessment of synovial enhancement was detected between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1).\n\n",

    "context": "Although the Internet is commonly used to recruit samples in studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors, it has not been used to measure patient-reported well-being. As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.\n\nThis study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.\n\nThe Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\n\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001).\n\n",
