    "context": "Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.

A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.",

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.",

    "context": "Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.

Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States, such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day). Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial.

Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.",

In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at ch\u00e2teau d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances.

Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply; she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for \"wickedly\" estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief, Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, the Prince of Wales, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled, Albert travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him. By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been \"killed by that dreadful business\", she said. She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances, and rarely set foot in London in the following years.

    "context": "On 2 March 1882, Roderick Maclean, a disgruntled poet apparently offended by Victoria's refusal to accept one of his poems, shot at the Queen as her carriage left Windsor railway station. Two schoolboys from Eton College struck him with their umbrellas, until he was hustled away by a policeman.

The context provides the necessary information, stating the date of the event as 2 March 1882. The task now is to rephrase the question and answer while maintaining their semantic equivalence and ensuring the question is challenging and clear.\n\nThe original question is quite straightforward and may be considered too easy. To enhance its complexity, it could be rephrased to require a deeper understanding or more nuanced consideration of the context.

    "orig_question": "Who returned to office after Peel resigned?",
    "orig_answer": "Melbourne",
    "context": "In 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.",

The central issue revolved around the Queen's refusal to replace her ladies of the bedchamber, who were predominantly wives of Whigs, with wives of Tories as Peel requested. This led to Peel's resignation and the subsequent return of Melbourne to office. The question \"Who returned to office after Peel resigned?\" directly relates to this sequence of events.

Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: \"I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ...\" The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover F\u00e9licien Mallefille.

In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the Silesian composer J\u00f3zef Elsner at the Warsaw Conservatory, studying music theory, figured bass and composition.[n 3] Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ, the \"eolomelodicon\", and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by Moscheles. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a similar recital on the instrument before Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1.

In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through.

    "context": "Internationally, Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain. She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at ch\u00e2teau d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances. Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides information about Queen Victoria's interactions with France and Britain, her visits with the French royal family, and her response to the revolutions of 1848. It also mentions her visit to Ireland. To create a meaningful question, we need to focus on the details related to her visit to Ireland. The original question asks for the year of Victoria's first visit to Ireland, and the answer is given as 1849. The context confirms that Victoria's first visit to Ireland was indeed in 1849 and notes that it was a public relations success but had no lasting impact on Irish nationalism.\n\nTo generate a more complex and thought-provoking question, we can incorporate additional details from the context. The context not only mentions Victoria's visit to Ireland but also provides information about her interactions with the French royal family and her response to the revolutionary scare in the UK. We can leverage this information to create a more nuanced question.\n\nUpon analyzing the context, it is clear that Victoria's interactions with other nations and her responses to political unrest are significant themes. Therefore, a question that connects these themes or explores their implications could be valuable.\n\nThe thought process involves identifying the key elements of the context and determining how they can be woven together to create a challenging question. Since the original question is straightforward and factual, we can consider rephrasing it to encourage deeper reflection or to test the domain expert's ability to contextualize the information.\n\nOne potential approach is to create a question that requires the test-taker to understand the broader context of Victoria's reign and her diplomatic efforts, as well as her responses to political challenges.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How did Queen Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 compare to her diplomatic efforts with France in terms of impact on nationalist movements?\nA: Both visits had a significant and lasting impact on the respective nationalist movements.\nB: While her diplomatic efforts with France were successful in preventing nationalist uprisings, her visit to Ireland had little lasting impact on Irish nationalism.\nC: Victoria's visit to Ireland was more effective in curbing nationalism than her interactions with the French royal family.\nD: The visit to Ireland was part of a broader strategy to address nationalism across Europe, similar to her efforts with France.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer, B, reflects that Victoria's diplomatic efforts with France were notable, but her visit to Ireland, while a public relations success, did not have a lasting impact on Irish nationalism.

However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.

    "context": "It was temporarily under the control of the Tibetan empire and Chinese from 650\u2013680 and then under the control of the Umayyads in 710. The Samanid Empire, 819 to 999, restored Persian control of the region and enlarged the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara (both cities are today part of Uzbekistan) which became the cultural centers of Iran and the region was known as Khorasan. The Kara-Khanid Khanate conquered Transoxania (which corresponds approximately with modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan and southwest Kazakhstan) and ruled between 999\u20131211. Their arrival in Transoxania signaled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, but gradually the Kara-khanids became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region.",
    "response": "## Step 1: Understand the given context and the original question and answer.\nThe context discusses the historical control and influence over a region known as Transoxania, which includes parts of modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and southwest Kazakhstan. It mentions various empires and khanates that controlled the region at different times. The original question asks, \"Who conquered Tansaxania?\" and the answer is \"The Kara-Khanid Khanate.\" However, there's a typo in the question; it should be \"Transoxania\" instead of \"Tansaxania.\"\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the context to identify relevant information for the question.\nThe context provides a historical overview of the region of Transoxania, mentioning its control under different empires and khanates. It specifically states that \"The Kara-Khanid Khanate conquered Transoxania... and ruled between 999\u20131211.\" This information directly answers the original question.\n\n## Step 3: Rephrase the question to be semantically equivalent but clearer and more detailed.\nTo create a more challenging and clear question, we can rephrase it to include more context from the provided text. For example, we can ask about the entity that conquered Transoxania and led to a shift in the region's cultural predominance.\n\n## Step 4: Rephrase the answer to maintain semantic equivalence.\nThe original answer, \"The Kara-Khanid Khanate,\" is straightforward. We need to ensure that the rephrased question is answered correctly by one of the provided options in the multiple-choice format.\n\n## Step 5: Generate a multiple-choice question based on the analysis.\nGiven the context and the need to create a challenging question, we can formulate a question that not only tests the knowledge of who conquered Transoxania but also understands the significance of this event.\n\n## Step 6: Create the question and answer options.\nQuestion: What khanate conquered Transoxania in the late 10th century, marking a significant shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, and subsequently became assimilated into the local Perso-Arab Muslim culture?\nA: The Samanid Empire\nB: The Umayyad Caliphate\nC: The Kara-Khanid Khanate\nD: The Tibetan Empire\n\n## Step 7: Determine the correct answer and provide an explanation.\nThe correct answer is C: The Kara-Khanid Khanate. The explanation is that the Kara-Khanid Khanate conquered Transoxania and ruled from 999 to 1211, leading to a shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance. They later became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region.\n\n## Step 8: Format the output according to the required structure.\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What khanate conquered Transoxania in the late 10th century, marking a significant shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, and subsequently became assimilated into the local Perso-Arab Muslim culture?\nA: The Samanid Empire\nB: The Umayyad Caliphate\nC: The Kara-Khanid Khanate\nD: The Tibetan Empire\nExplanation: The Kara-Khanid Khanate conquered Transoxania, ruling from 999 to 1211, and their arrival marked a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism.

The context provides specific details such as the date, the perpetrator's motive (being offended by the Queen's refusal to accept one of his poems), and the Queen's reaction to the attempt on her life and the legal outcome for Maclean.\n\nTo create a challenging and meaningful question, I will consider the nuances and significant relationships within the context. The given question asks for the identity of the disgruntled poet who shot at Victoria's carriage. To rephrase this while increasing complexity and depth, I could explore the context further to formulate a question that requires deeper understanding or insight.\n\nThe original question is straightforward and factual. To enhance it, I could incorporate more details from the context or change its focus to require more than mere recall. For instance, exploring the motivations or the consequences of the event could lead to a more nuanced question.\n\nGiven the context and the original question, I will now plan a rewritten question that is semantically equivalent but encourages deeper thought. The question could focus on the details surrounding the event or the reactions to it, making it more engaging and challenging for a domain expert.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Who was the individual that attempted to assassinate Queen Victoria on 2 March 1882, motivated by a personal grievance related to his literary work being rejected by her?\nA: Roderick Maclean\nB: John Brown\nC: Edward Oxford\nD: Arthur Orton\n\nExplanation: The correct answer, Roderick Maclean, is identified in the context as the disgruntled poet who shot at Queen Victoria's carriage.

The transition from Gladstone to Rosebery to Salisbury indicates a period of political instability or at least change in leadership during Victoria's later reign.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The original question is straightforward but lacks depth.
