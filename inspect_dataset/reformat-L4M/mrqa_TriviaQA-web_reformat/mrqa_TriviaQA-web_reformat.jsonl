    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Kingdom of EnglandThe Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century\u2014when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms\u2014until 1707, when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. [PAR] In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.  [PAR] Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066\u20131154,  Plantagenet 1154\u20131485,  Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of  1649\u20131660). [PAR] Dynastically, all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional, beginning with Henry II (reigned 1154-1189) as from that time, the Angevin kings became \"more English in nature\"; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I  of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor. [PAR] The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558\u20131603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World. [PAR] From the accession of James I in 1603, the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the  execution of Charles I in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War  established  the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament, although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. [PAR] From this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom, with the reservation that it is \"uncodified\", is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689. On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.   [PAR] Name [PAR] The Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the Engle  or the Angelcynn, originally names of the Angles. They called their land Engla land, meaning \"land of the English\",  [PAR] by \u00c6thelweard Latinized Anglia, from an original Anglia vetus, the purported homeland of the Angles (called Angulus by Bede).  The name Engla land became England by haplology during the Middle English period (Engle-land, Engelond).  The Latin name was Anglia or Anglorum terra, the Old French and Anglo-Norman one Angleterre.  By the 14th century, England was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain. [PAR] The standard",

The text outlines the ruling dynasties of England from the Norman Conquest in 1066 through to the union with Scotland in 1707. Specifically, it mentions the Tudor dynasty ruling from 1485 to 1603. Since 1500 falls within this range, we can infer that the monarch on the throne at that time was from the Tudor dynasty. The text states that Henry VII was the first Tudor monarch, reigning from 1485, and was succeeded by his son Henry VIII. Given that Henry VII's reign started in 1485 and considering typical lifespans and reign durations, it is plausible he was still on the throne in 1500.\n\nThe text does not directly state Henry VII's end of reign, but it does provide the start of his reign and the succession information. Henry VIII's reign began after Henry VII, and since Henry VIII's reign started in 1509 (upon his father's death), it implies Henry VII was still reigning in 1500, as his son succeeded him in 1509.\n\nThus, based on the information provided and the historical timeline, the correct answer is Henry VII.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Which English monarch was reigning in the year 1500, during the Tudor dynasty that ruled England from 1485 to 1603?\nA: Henry VIII\nB: Henry VII\nC: Edward IV\nD: Richard III\nExplanation: The Tudor dynasty ruled England from 1485 to 1603.

[PAR] Al Capone was a notorious gangster who ran an organized crime syndicate in Chicago during the 1920s, taking advantage of the era of Prohibition . Capone, who was both charming and charitable as well as powerful and vicious, became an iconic figure of the successful American gangster. [PAR] Dates: January 17, 1899 -- January 25, 1947 [PAR] Also Known As: Alphonse Capone, Scarface [PAR] Al Capone's Childhood [PAR] Al Capone was the fourth of nine children born to Gabriele and Teresina (Teresa) Capone. Although Capone's parents had emigrated from Italy, Al Capone grew up in Brooklyn, New York . [PAR] From all known accounts, Capone's childhood was a normal one. His father was a barber and his mother stayed home with the children. They were a tight-knit Italian family who were trying to succeed in their new country. [PAR] Like many immigrant families at the time, the Capone children often dropped out of school early to help earn money for the family. Al Capone stayed in school until he was 14 and then left to take a number of odd jobs. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] The St. Valentine's Day Massacre [PAR] Around the same time, Capone joined a street gang called the South Brooklyn Rippers and then later the Five Points Juniors. These were groups of teenagers who roamed the streets, protected their turf from rival gangs, and sometimes carried out petty crimes like stealing cigarettes. [PAR] Scarface [PAR] It was through the Five Points gang that Al Capone came to the attention of brutal New York mobster Frankie Yale. In 1917, 18-year-old Al Capone went to work for Yale at the Harvard Inn as a bartender and as a waiter and bouncer when needed. Capone watched and learned as Yale used violence to maintain control over his empire. [PAR] One day while working at the Harvard Inn, Capone saw a man and woman sitting at a table. After his initial advances were ignored, Capone went up to the good-looking woman and whispered in her ear, \"Honey, you have a nice ass and I mean that as a compliment.\" The man with her was her brother, Frank Gallucio. [PAR] Defending his sister's honor, Gallucio punched Capone. However, Capone didn't let it end there; he decided to fight back. Gallucio then took out a knife and slashed at Capone's face, managing to cut Capone's left cheek three times (one of which cut Capone from ear to mouth). The scars left from this attack led to Capone's nickname of \"Scarface,\" a name he personally hated. [PAR] Family Life [PAR] Not long after this attack, Al Capone met Mary (\"Mae\") Coughlin, who was pretty, blonde, middle-class, and came from a respectable Irish family. A few months after they started dating, Mae became pregnant. Al Capone and Mae got married on December 30, 1918, three weeks after their son (Albert Francis Capone, a.k.a. \"Sonny\") was born. Sonny was to remain Capone's only child. [PAR] Throughout the rest of his life, Al Capone kept his family and his business interests completely separate. Capone was a doting father and husband, taking great care in keeping his family safe, cared for, and out of the spotlight. [PAR] However, despite his love for his family, Capone did have a number of mistresses over the years. Plus, unknown to him at the time, Capone contracted syphilis from a prostitute before he met Mae. Since the symptoms of syphilis can disappear quickly, Capone had no idea that he still had the sexually transmitted disease or that it would so greatly affect his health in later years. [PAR] Capone Moves to Chicago [PAR] About 1920, Capone left the East Coast and headed to Chicago. He was looking for a fresh start working for Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio. Unlike Yale who used violence to run his racket, Torrio was a sophisticated gentleman who preferred cooperation and negotiation to rule his crime organization. Capone",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Dartboard Sequence - MathPagesThe Dartboard Sequence [PAR] The Dartboard Sequence [PAR] The arrangement of the numbers around the circumference of a standard  dart board is as shown below         20 1 18 4 13 6 10 15 2 17 3 19 7 16 8 11 14 9 12 5   Oddly enough, no one seems to know for sure how this particular arrangement was selected.  It evidently dates back at least 100 years.  Some say the  pattern was devised by a carpenter named Brian Gamlin in 1896, while others attribute it to someone named Thomas William Buckle in 1913, but both of  these attributions are relatively recent, and neither can be traced back  to a contemporary source.  Also, although it's clear that the numbers are ordered to mix the large and small together, and possibly to separate numerically close values as far as possible (e.g., 20 is far from 19), no  one seems to know of any simple criterion that uniquely singles out this  particular arrangement as the best possible in any quantitative sense.   It may be just an accident of history that this particular arrangement  has been adopted as the standard dart board format.   It's interesting to consider various possible criteria for choosing a  circular arrangement of the first n positive integers.  In order to get  as \"flat\" a distribution as possible, we might try to minimize the  sum of the squares of each k consecutive terms.  For example, setting  k = 3, the standard dard board sequence gives    (20+1+18)^2 + (1+18+4)^2 + (18+4+13)^2 + ... + (5+20+1)^2  =  20478   Apparently the standard board layout described above is called the \"London\" dart board, and there is another, less common, version called the \"Manchester\" dart board, which has the sequence        20 1 16 6 17 8 12 9 14 5 19 2 15 3 18 7 11 10 13 4  for which the sum of squares of each set of three consecutive numbers is 20454, just slightly less than the London arrangement.  In contrast,  if we were to arrange the numbers by just inter-weaving the largest and  smallest numbers like this          20 1 19 2 18 3 17 4 16 5 15 6 14 7 13 8 12 9 11 10     the resulting sum of squares of each 3 consecutive elements is 20510, so the standard dart boards are, in this sense, more flat distributions.   Needless to say, all of these arrangements are much more flat than the  natural monotonic sequence         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   which has a sum of 24350.    By the way, note that if the sum of the squares of every sum of three  consecutive numbers for a given arrangement is S, then we can form another arrangement with the same sum simply by taking the \"21-complement\", i.e.,  subtracting each number from 21. For example, the complement of the  standard London arrangement is        1 20 3 17 8 15 11 6 19 4 18 2 14 5 13 10 7 12 9 16  which has the same sum (20478) as the London arrangement. This works because if we begin with an arrangement a,b,c,d,... having the sum     S = (a+b+c)^2 + (b+c+d)^2 + (c+d+e)^2 + ...  and replace each of the numbers a,b,c,... with 21-a, 21-b, 21-c,... respectively, the sum S' of this complementary arrangement is     S' = [(21-a)+(21-b)+(21-c)]^2 + [(21-b)+(21-c)+(21-d)]^2 + ...        = [63-(a+b+c)]^2 + [63-(b+c+d)]^2 + ...        = S + 20(63)^2 - 2(63)[(a+b+c)+(b+c+d)+...]  Each of the numbers from 1 to 20 appears three times in the summation inside the square brackets in the last term, so that summation equals 630, and hence S' = S. (The same identity applies to the N+1 complement for sums of squares of every sum of k consecutive terms of a circular  arrangement of the first",
    "response": "## Step 1: Understand the given context and the task\nThe task involves analyzing the provided context about the Dartboard Sequence and generating a question-answer pair based on the given instructions. The context describes the arrangement of numbers on a standard dartboard and discusses various aspects of this arrangement.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the context to identify relevant information for the question\nThe context provides the sequence of numbers on a standard dartboard: 20 1 18 4 13 6 10 15 2 17 3 19 7 16 8 11 14 9 12 5. To answer the question \"On a standard dartboard, what number lies opposite 13?\", we need to identify the number opposite 13 in this sequence.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the number opposite 13 on the dartboard\nGiven the sequence, we first locate 13, which is the 5th number. To find the number opposite 13, we need to count 10 numbers ahead (since there are 20 numbers in total, and half of 20 is 10). Starting from 13 (at position 5), we count 10 numbers forward: 6 (6th), 10 (7th), 15 (8th), 2 (9th), 17 (10th), 3 (11th), 19 (12th), 7 (13th), 16 (14th), 8 (15th). So, 8 is opposite 13.\n\n## Step 4: Rephrase the question and generate answer options\nThe original question is \"On a standard dartboard, what number lies opposite 13?\" The answer is 8. We need to rephrase the question and generate plausible answer options.\n\n## Step 5: Rephrase the question to encourage deeper understanding or critical engagement\nRephrased question: \"Considering the standard arrangement of numbers on a dartboard, which number is diametrically opposite the number 13?\"\n\n## Step 6: Generate plausible answer options\nTo generate plausible answer options, we should consider numbers that could reasonably be opposite 13 based on the dartboard's arrangement or other related numbers.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Ten Facts About Fantasia (1940)Ten Facts About Fantasia (1940) [PAR] Previous Facts - Next Facts [PAR] Ten Facts About Walt Disney's Fantasia [PAR] Here are ten facts about Walt Disney's animated  masterpiece from 1940, featuring a compilation of animations accompanied by a soundtrack  of classical music. [PAR] Fact One [PAR] Fantasia was Walt Disney's third feature film, following on from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940) [PAR] Fact Two [PAR] The Sorcerer's Apprentice, perhaps the most famous short of the film Fantasia, starred Mickey Mouse as the, er, Sorcerer's Apprentice. This role was intended as a come-back role for Disney's famous mouse, who was losing out in popularity to Donald Duck. However, also considered for the role of the apprentice was Dopey from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The animation itself was also originally going to be a one-off cartoon, but since it was more expensive to produce than regular Disney cartoons and was unlikely to make any profit, Disney decided to make it part of a collection of animated sequences with classical music accompaniments which could then be released as a feature film. That collection of animated shorts would become Fantasia. [PAR] Fact Three [PAR] The conductor of the music used in Fantasia was Leopold Stokowski. When The Sorcerer's Apprentice was being worked on, Stokowski offered to conduct the orchestra for free. He probably changed his mind when he found out he would be conducting the orchestra for the entire film. [PAR] Fact Four [PAR] Live action sequences shown between the animated segments show an orchestra playing the soundtrack. In those scenes, the orchestra were miming! The music for all sequences apart from The Sorceror's Apprentice was played by Philadelphia Orchestra. In the film, members of the orchestra pretending to play to the pre-recorded music were local musicians and employees of the film studio. [PAR] Fact Five [PAR] The original release of Fantasia featured an intermission which was announced by the film's host, Deems Taylor. The members of the orchestra are seen leaving their seats while the curtains close, both on the film and in the movie theatre showing it. After the intermission, which would have lasted for fifteen minutes, the curtains in the theatre and on the film open and the orchestra are seen to return to their seats, and then have a bit of a jam session.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Six [PAR] Fantasia, which was essentially a way for Walt Disney to show off animation and sound techniques in films, was the first commercial film to have its soundtrack recorded in stereo. It was also planned that parts of it would be shown in widescreen and other parts to be in 3-D, and, to make the film a real treat for the senses, for perfumes to be sprayed into the theatre during the Nutcracker Suite sequence.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Seven [PAR] Nowadays, films are completed weeks, months or even years before they get their premiere. Fantasia however was completed four hours before premiering in New York City on November 13th 1940. The final scene to be produced was flown to New York on the day of the premiere and edited into the film in time for its first showing. [PAR] Fact Eight [PAR] Despite getting generally good reviews, Fantasia was only shown in twelve movie theatres on its first release due to Disney's distribution company RKO initially deciding not to distribute it. The meant that the film could not make a profit, and meant that the budget for Disney's next film, Dumbo, was quite low. The film got a national release a couple of years later, although heavily edited (from the original 125 runtime to 81 minutes) and in mono. Again it was a commercial failure. A release in 1956 restored the stereo soundtrack, although it was only on its release in 1969 that the film finally made a profit, due to its psychedelic nature being popular with the teenage and college student audiences of the time. Its soundtrack was completely rerecorded for a 1982 release. Even the host's introductions to each segment were dubbed over. A 1990 release used the original soundtrack which had been digitally remastered, and a release for 2000 saw several of the original",

On that day the United Kingdom changed from the centuries old tradition of using 12 pence to the shilling and 20 shillings to the pound to a new decimal 100 new pence to the pound. [PAR] Options considered [PAR] There had been much debate as to the best way of implementing the switch. [PAR] Australia used a dollar valued at ten old shillings, making the new cent equal to 1.2 old pence, a small change in value. [PAR] An alternative was to go to a pound-mil system, with a mil equal to 0.24 old pence, a latter-day successor to the farthing. [PAR] Another was to keep the penny and have a new unit at 100 pence (eight shillings and fourpence). [PAR] However, in the UK the pound was considered to be particularly important because of the UK's international trading status.  In addition, having a new penny worth 2.4 old pence was less of a problem as inflation had made its purchasing power insignificant.  As a temporary measure a half new penny was introduced, but as will be seen this had a short life.  There was even a pattern quarter penny made in aluminium, but this was not proceeded with. [PAR] It was realised at the time that the decision was made that the life of the halfpenny would be very short, but it was felt necessary despite the considerable extra cost of having to mint the coin.  Banks never accepted transactions involving an odd halfpenny. [PAR] The Timetable for the Change [PAR] The change was made gradually over three years, in a number of stages. [PAR] In 1968 new shillings and florins were issued as 5 new pence and 10 new pence coins.  The older shillings and florins continued to    circulate long after decimalisation until the size of the coins was reduced.  Theoretically    silver coins from 1816 could still have been found in change, but the active   withdrawal of silver in the years following the change in 1947, followed   by the combination of a dramatic rise in the price of silver with devaluation   in 1967 meant that silver coins rapidly vanished from circulation. [PAR] Blue plastic wallets containing the new 5p and 10p coins dated 1968, along with 1/2p, 1p and 2p   coins dated 1971 were put on sale. These wallets are still very common. [PAR] In October 1969 the 50 new pence piece replaced the 10 shilling note, which ceased to be legal tender on 22nd November 1970. [PAR] The old halfpenny was demonetised on 1st August 1969. [PAR] The half-crown was demonetised on 1st January 1970. [PAR] The remaining decimal coins became legal tender on 15th February 1971.   Maundy coins (and silver threepenny pieces of Maundy design, i.e. with   a crowned three on the reverse) were revalued as being in new pence at the same time. [PAR] The changeover was so rapid that the old penny and nickel brass threepence pieces   had been removed from circulation by the end of 1971, although I know   of one shop in the Yorkshire Dales which continued to use the old currency   for a long time on the basis that 'this new-fangled stuff will never catch on'. [PAR] The old penny and threepence coins ceased to be legal tender on 31st August 1971, just over six months after D-day.  It is no longer possible to exchange them for current coins at a bank. [PAR] Later Developments [PAR] The sixpence , which was allowed to continue circulating at 2\u00bd new pence, was  eventually withdrawn at the end of June 1980.  I am indebted to Brian Dominic for the following quote from John Glover's book \"London's Underground\":  \"The adoption of decimal currency on 15 February 1971 posed a few problems for London Transport, which had favoured the \u00a3 Sterling being halved in value and divided into 100 pence - what today might be termed a '50p pound'.

[PAR] Credit: public domain [PAR] In his play \"Richard III,\" Shakespeare depicted the king as a deformed killer and an evil tyrant. As this was well before the age of 24-hour news and Twitter, it was the ultimate negative press of its time. While some elements of the play are grounded in fact, Shakespeare also took some artistic license, as the play was written more than 100 years after the king\u2019s death and there was no one still alive who had known Richard III. Here are some of the facts and myths about Richard III. [PAR] Early years [PAR] The boy who would become Richard III was born in England on Oct. 2, 1452. He was the youngest surviving son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and his wife, Cecily Neville. There was not a high expectation that he was going to rise to fame \u2014 or infamy \u2014 based on his fairly quiet first years in Northamptonshire, England.\u00a0 [PAR] Richard's life changed at an early age when his family, the House of York, waged the War of the Roses against the Lancastrians to gain control of the country. Richard's father, an uncle and a brother died in a December 1460 battle. [PAR] Another of Richard's brothers, Edward, ultimately defeated Henry VI and his Lancastrian supporters the following February. Young Richard became a prince when his brother took the crown as Edward IV in 1461. Ultimately, Richard assumed the title Duke of Gloucester. [PAR] Richard's role as warrior [PAR] The War of the Roses resumed again in 1469. Richard was involved in many key battles and was wounded. Edward IV lost power briefly in 1470 but his forces were ultimately victorious. [PAR] Richard was able to enjoy the spoils of victory, marrying Anne Neville, the daughter of the Earl of Warwick, and gaining access to the family\u2019s immense fortune. Richard and Anne\u2019s only child, a son named Edward, was born around 1476, but he died at a young age, and Anne soon followed. [PAR] In the 1480s, the future king went into battle again, assisting his brother to invade Scotland. His strong performance in this conflict bolstered his stature and fueled his rise to power. [PAR] A contemporary drawing of Richard III and his queen, Anne Neville, and son, Edward, Prince of Wales [PAR] Credit: public domain [PAR] Time in power [PAR] Richard's nephew, Edward V, took over when his father, King Edward IV, died in 1483. Edward V was only 12 years old when he became king. In a power grab, Richard locked Edward V and his younger brother, Richard, in the Tower of London in May 1483. Richard has been accused of having his nephews murdered, but historians debate the boys' fate. It is possible that they died imprisoned in the tower but were not killed. [PAR] Lord Hastings, a trusted adviser to Edward IV, was executed on charges of treason, completing Richard\u2019s power grab; he became king on July 6, 1483. [PAR] While serving as king for just two years, Richard III championed some principles of justice that still guide legal systems of today. He proclaimed that laws had to be administered impartially and justice had to be meted out quickly. He also established the concept that everyone had the right to be represented by a lawyer regardless of his or her ability to pay. [PAR] Richard III relished his role as a warrior and he ultimately died in battle. He was killed on Aug. 22, 1485, by the forces of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth Field. He was not treated regally in death, and is the only king who didn\u2019t have a tomb. His remains were recently unearthed in a parking lot in Leicester, England.

Harry was delighted and couldn't thank Hagrid enough, while Hedwig had already fallen asleep after leaving the shop. [2] This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the Dursleys did not celebrate his brithday. He became quickly attached to her. [PAR] Harry Potter's pet [PAR] Harry decided on her name after finding it in A History of Magic . Before attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Harry routinely stayed in his bedroom with Hedwig, away from the Dursleys , since she was his only friend at 4 Privet Drive . [4] Throughout her life, Hedwig provided Harry with mail service, as well as loyal companionship. Hedwig often showed Harry her affection by gently nibbling his ears and fingers, and seemed fully capable of understanding his wishes (as she faithfully followed Harry's orders to peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger until they responded to him). [PAR] Hedwig with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley [PAR] Hedwig was also highly intelligent, as she flew to France completely of her own accord while Hermione was on holiday there with her parents, just to ensure that Harry received a gift from her for his thirteenth birthday, later arriving at the Leaky Cauldron shortly after Harry stormed out of Privet Drive after a particularly bad argument despite the fact that she had been away and allegedly staying with the Weasleys when Harry left the Dursleys. According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions. She also seemed fairly disdainful of the hyperactive behaviour of Ron Weasley 's pet owl Pigwidgion (Pig, as Ron called him) [PAR] Harry having Hedwig deliver a message to Sirius Black [PAR] While living with the Dursleys , Hedwig was locked in her cage for months at a time to prevent Harry from sending messages to his \"freaky little friends.\" As a result, the first holidays after Hogwarts were a frustrating and boring time for her, as much as for Harry. When Harry was rescued by the Weasley brothers in 1992 , Hedwig was freed from her cage and flew along following behind the flying Ford Anglia all the way to The Burrow . In 1992 when Harry thought his friends had forgotten him, he mused that Hedwig was the only reason he knew that discovering the wizarding world had not just been a dream. Fortunately, her frustrated hooting during her first year with them convinced the Dursleys to subsequently let Harry let Hedwig out for flights so long as he didn't use her to send messages, though Harry sometimes ignored this rule and possibly began ignoring it entirely after meeting Sirius Black and gaining leverage with the Dursleys.

[PAR] But while the goals and upsets have been occurring in the Football League for 125 years , the same cannot be said for the handing out of cards. [PAR] They made their debut in the English game in 1976, and the first player to receive a red one was Blackburn Rovers winger Dave Wagstaffe. [PAR] The former Wolves midfielder, who died this week aged 70, was given his marching orders in a Division Two match at Leyton Orient on 2 October. Later that afternoon a certain George Best also saw red playing for Fulham at Southampton in the same division. [PAR] But where did the idea for the cards come from? [PAR] Traffic lights [PAR] The cards were shown after the Football League voluntarily adopted a system introduced to the game in the 1970 World Cup. [PAR] David Barber, from the Football Association, said the idea is credited to English referee Ken Aston from Ilford, London. [PAR] Image caption Winger Dave Wagstaffe left Wolves in 1976 for Blackburn Rovers [PAR] Mr Barber said: \"He refereed the 1963 FA Cup Final and was in charge of the referees at the '66 World Cup, during which there was confusion over [Argentina's] Antonio Rattin's dismissal against England. [PAR] \"Had he actually been sent off?\" [PAR] The player had indeed been given his marching orders, for reasons that were about as unclear as the indication of the dismissal itself. [PAR] Mr Aston had to help persuade Argentina's captain to leave the field of play. [PAR] It was while the referee was driving along Kensington High Street that he had the idea of introducing yellow and red cards in a bid to overcome language barriers and give a clear indication to players and supporters alike. [PAR] He was stopped at traffic lights when it dawned on him that yellow could be for a caution, a warning to a player to take it easy. And red would simply mean stop - your game is over. [PAR] The card system was trialled at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico and they were introduced into European club games at some point afterwards. [PAR] Football violence [PAR] Some six years later they made their way into the English game where they were used in the domestic game for less than five years initially. [PAR] Tony Brown, from SoccerData, explained why two red cards were shown on the day they were introduced. [PAR] \"Wagstaffe was the first to receive a red, for arguing with the ref [after 36 mins],\" Mr Brown said. [PAR] \"George Best received a red for foul language in the 67th minute.\" [PAR] Image caption The inspiration for the cards came from colours of the traffic light [PAR] He added: \"In 1980, there was concern over violence on and off the pitch. [PAR] \"The FA, not the League, thought that 'demonstrative referees' were part of the problem, and decided to do away with red cards.\" [PAR] The decision was ratified by the FA Council in January 1981 and two of the last red cards, for the time being, were shown to David Hodgson and Nicky Reid in a game between Manchester City and Middlesbrough. [PAR] But Mr Brown said that by 1987 \"the International Board, the rule-making body of the international game, said that England was out of step and should reintroduce cards for the 1987-88 season\".

More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 were killed during the hysteria. [PAR] Ever since those dark days ended, the trials have become synonymous with mass hysteria and scapegoating. The following are some facts about the Salem Witch Trials: [PAR] What Were the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials were a series of witchcraft cases brought before local magistrates in a settlement called Salem which was a part of the Massachusetts Bay colony in the 17th century. [PAR] When Exactly Did the Salem Witch Trials Take Place? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials officially began in February of 1692, when the afflicted girls accused the first three victims, Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchcraft and ended in May of 1693, when the remaining victims were released from jail. [PAR] What Caused the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials was a classic example of scapegoating. Fear combined with a \u201ctrigger,\u201d a traumatic or stressful event, is what often leads to scapegoating. Fear of the Devil, and witches who did his bidding, was very real in Salem at the time. [PAR] In Massachusetts during the 17th century , people often feared that the Devil was constantly trying to find ways to infiltrate and destroy Christians and their communities. [PAR] As a devout and strongly religious community living in near isolation in the mysterious New World, the community of Salem had a heightened sense of fear of the Devil and then experienced a \u201ctrigger\u201d when Tituba, one of the accused witches, confessed that she and others were in fact witches working for the Devil. [PAR] This induced panic and hysteria and quickly sparked a massive witch hunt. The fact is, although there were many other contributing factors, Tituba\u2019s confession is the main reason why the Salem Witch Trials happened. [PAR] The Massachusetts Bay colonists had accused and convicted people of witchcraft before, starting with Margaret Jones in 1648, but nobody in the colony had ever confessed to being a witch before or ominously stated that there were other witches out there. Tituba\u2019s simple confession reinforced all of the colonist\u2019s underlying fears. [PAR] \u201cThe Witch, No. 1,\u201d lithograph by Joseph E. Baker, published by George H. Walker & Co, circa 1892 [PAR] In addition to this constant sense of fear, Salem residents were also under a great deal of stress during this period due to a number of factors. [PAR] One major factor was that in 1684, King Charles II revoked the Massachusetts Bay Colony\u2019s royal charter, a legal document granting the colonists permission to colonize the area. [PAR] The charter was revoked because the colonists had violated several of the charter\u2019s rules, which included basing laws on religious beliefs and discriminating against Anglicans. [PAR] Charles II died shortly after and James II replaced him and merged the Massachusetts Bay Colony into the Dominion of New England which instituted a royally-appointed government with many strict new laws. In 1689, after the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, the Massachusetts Bay colonists overthrew the unpopular Dominion of New England. [PAR] In 1691, the new King and Queen of England, Mary and William of Orange, issued a new, more anti-religious charter, instead of reissuing the old charter, and also combined the Massachusetts Bay Colony , Plymouth Colony and several other colonies into one. The new charter and regime basically continued the policies of the Dominion of New England. [PAR] The puritans, who had left England due to religious persecution, feared their religion was under attack again and worried they were losing control of their colony. The political instability and threat to their religion created a feeling of uneasiness and discontent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [PAR] Other factors included a recent small pox epidemic in the colony, growing rivalries between families within the colony, a constant threat of attack from nearby Native-American tribes, and a recent influx of refugees trying to escape King William\u2019s war with France in Canada and upstate New York.

It provides a list of elements and their names' sources, often referencing Greek mythology or Latin terminology.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the given question and answer\nThe original question asks for the chemical element with the symbol 'Ac' whose name is derived from the Greek for 'ray'. The answer is \"actinium\".\n\n## Step 4: Conduct a thoughtful content examination within `<document_analysis>` tags\n<document_analysis>\nThe context provides information on the etymology of chemical element names, particularly those derived from Greek and Latin. The element \"Actinium\" is mentioned as being derived from the Greek word \"aktinos,\" meaning \"ray.\" This information directly relates to the question about the element with the symbol 'Ac'. The context is relevant and provides sufficient background for understanding the etymology of element names.\n\nUpon examining the question and answer, it's clear that the question seeks to test knowledge of the etymology of chemical element names, specifically the origin of \"Actinium.\" The answer, \"actinium,\" is directly supported by the context.\n\nTo enhance the question's complexity and encourage deeper understanding, it could be rephrased to require more thought or to integrate more information from the context.\n\nThe difficulty level of the original question is relatively straightforward, as it directly asks for the element associated with a specific Greek word. To increase the complexity, the question could be rephrased to require the test-taker to infer or apply their knowledge in a more nuanced way.\n\nFor example, instead of directly asking for the element derived from the Greek for 'ray', the question could ask for the element whose name is associated with a particular property or characteristic (in this case, emitting rays), thereby requiring the test-taker to understand the etymological connection.\n\nThe original question and answer are clear and directly related to the information provided in the context.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Music Note Values - Essential Music TheoryMusic Note Values [PAR] Music Note Values [PAR] Each music note written on the stave has a duration (length) as well as pitch. It is the design of the note that tells you its duration, in the same way as the position on the staff tells you the pitch. So each music note on a stave gives  you two pieces of information, pitch and duration. This page focuses on  the duration of each note. [PAR] The Rhythm Tree [PAR] In order to fully understand note lengths become familiar with the rhythm tree. Click here to learn more about the rhythm tree before continuing. The rhythm tree shows how the notes are related to each other. [PAR] Double Whole Note (Breve) [PAR] Although the whole note is the longest note we generally use today, as  is hinted at by the UK name there used be a note called a Breve. This is  known as a Double Whole note in the US. The double whole note (breve)  divides into 2 whole notes (semibreves) following the pattern of the  other notes in the Rhythm Tree. The Double Whole note (Breve) is  therefore worth 8 quarter notes (crotchets). The Double Whole note  (Breve) fell out of use as smaller value notes were invented by  composers. It can be notated as an open rectangle or a whole note with  bars either side. Click here to read more about the double whole note (breve) and how our modern system of music notation developed. Make sure you  have a few spare moments though as once you start reading the history of  the music note it's difficult to stop! [PAR] Whole Note (Semibreve) [PAR] The Whole note is the longest music note in general use today. It is an  open note with no stem. I always say to my students it looks like a  hole\u2026so it is easy to remember! The duration of the whole note is 4  quarter notes. [PAR] Half Note (Minim) [PAR] The Half note duration is 2 quarter notes. It differs from the whole  note in that it has a stem, although it is still open. For students I  liken this stem to the line in the middle of the \u00bd. This also helps them  remember that 1 half note is worth 2 beats (in 4/4 timing, which is  what they are usually working in when learning this). [PAR] Quarter Note (Crotchet) [PAR] The quarter note has become the  de facto standard 1 beat music note.  This has happened as the 4/4 time signature is the most popular (with  3/4 and 2/4 following close behind) and quarter notes have a duration of  1 in these time signatures. It is also roughly in the middle of the  most used notes in the Rhythm Tree ,  making the quarter note the ideal candidate for ensuring whole notes  don't become too long to count, and shorter, popular notes such as  eighth and sixteenth notes aren't impossible to count in terms of them  being fractions of a note. The quarter note changes from the half note  as it is filled in, as opposed to empty. [PAR] Eighth Note (Quaver) [PAR] The eighth note is worth \u00bd of a Quarter note. It may also be considered  as a one beat note in 3/8 and similar timings, the 8 on the bottom of  the time signature giving the clue that you are counting in eighth  notes. This is the first note in the rhythm tree to have a flag.  The flag is the name for the 'tail' added to the eighth note. Eighth  notes may be a single as shown on the left, or joined together with beams. [PAR] It is common to see eighth notes joined into sets of 2 to make one beat.  Eighth notes may also be grouped in 3s, 4s, 5s, or even 6s depending on  the time signature. Remember, however, that no matter how many eighth  notes are joined, each one is worth half a quarter note. [PAR] Sixteenth note (Semiquaver) [PAR] The",
    "response": "## Step 1: Understand the given context and the task\nThe task involves analyzing the provided context about music note values and generating a question-answer pair based on the given question and answer. The context explains various music note values, their durations, and how they are represented.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given question and answer\nThe given question is \"In music, what is the name given to 1/16th of the whole note?\" and the answer is \"semiquaver.\" We need to understand the context related to this question and answer to rephrase them appropriately.\n\n## Step 3: Identify relevant information from the context\nFrom the context, we know that the whole note (semibreve) has a duration of 4 quarter notes. The context also mentions that the sixteenth note is referred to as a semiquaver. Although the context does not directly state that a sixteenth note is 1/16th of a whole note, it implies this relationship through the rhythm tree explanation.\n\n## Step 4: Verify the relationship between a whole note and a sixteenth note\nA whole note is worth 4 quarter notes. An eighth note is half a quarter note, and a sixteenth note is half an eighth note, making it 1/4 of a quarter note. Thus, if a whole note = 4 quarter notes, then a quarter note is 1/4 of a whole note. An eighth note is 1/2 of a quarter note, so it's 1/8 of a whole note. A sixteenth note, being half of an eighth note, is 1/16 of a whole note. This confirms the relationship.\n\n## Step 5: Rephrase the question and answer\nTo rephrase the question and maintain its semantic equivalence, we should consider the information given and the context. The question could be rephrased to something like, \"What is the term used in music to denote a note that has a duration of one-sixteenth of a whole note?\" The answer remains related to \"semiquaver.\"\n\n## Step 6: Generate the output in the required format\nTo adhere to the output format, we need to create a multiple-choice question with the correct answer and three distractors, along with an explanation for the correct answer.\n\n## Step 7: Create the multiple-choice options\nGiven that the answer is \"semiquaver,\" we can create distractors that are plausible but incorrect. For example, \"quaver\" (eighth note), \"demisemiquaver\" (thirty-second note), and \"hemidemisemiquaver\" (sixty-fourth note) could be used as distractors because they are all related to note values but represent different durations.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate the question and answer options\nQuestion: What is the term used in music to denote a note that has a duration of one-sixteenth of a whole note?\nA: Quaver\nB: Semiquaver\nC: Demisemiquaver\nD: Hemidemisemiquaver\n\n## Step 9: Provide the explanation and correct answer\nExplanation: The term \"semiquaver\" is used to denote a sixteenth note, which is 1/16th of a whole note. This is because, in the rhythm tree, each note value is halved to get the next smaller note value. Thus, a whole note (semibreve) divided by 2 gives a half note (minim), divided by 2 again gives a quarter note (crotchet), and so on, until we reach a sixteenth note, which is termed a semiquaver.\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nThe final answer is presented in the required format as follows:\n\n<document_analysis>\nThe context provided explains the different values of music notes and their corresponding names. The question asks for the term used to denote a note that is 1/16th of a whole note. The relevant information from the context indicates that a sixteenth note is called a semiquaver. The task involves rephrasing the question and generating a multiple-choice format with appropriate distractors.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the term used in music to denote a note that represents one-sixteenth of the duration of a whole note, which is a fundamental concept in understanding rhythm and note values in music notation?\nA: Quaver\nB: Semiquaver\nC: Demisemiquaver\nD: Hemidemisemiquaver\nExplanation: The term \"semiquaver\" is used to denote a sixteenth note. In music notation, note values are related in a hierarchical manner, with each larger note being twice the duration of the next smaller one. Thus, a whole note (semibreve) is divided into two half notes (minims), and continuing this halving, we reach the sixteenth note, which is termed a semiquaver.\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with whom she has four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. [PAR] Elizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and reciprocal visits to and from the Pope. She has seen major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. She has also reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of her realms. She is the world's oldest reigning monarch as well as Britain's longest-lived. In 2015, she surpassed the reign of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in world history. [PAR] Times of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, her coronation in 1953, and the celebration of milestones such as her Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. Moments of sadness for her include the death of her father, aged 56; the assassination of Prince Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten; the breakdown of her children's marriages in 1992 (her annus horribilis); the death in 1997 of her son's ex-wife, Diana, Princess of Wales; and the deaths of her mother and sister in 2002. Elizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and severe press criticism of the royal family but support for the monarchy remains high, as does her personal popularity.

Her father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King. Her mother, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair.  She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,  and named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after George V's mother, who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.  Called \"Lilibet\" by her close family,  based on what she called herself at first,  she was cherished by her grandfather George V, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.  [PAR] Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford, who was casually known as \"Crawfie\".

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Washington (state)Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States located north of Oregon, west of Idaho, and south of the Canadian province of British Columbia on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Named after George Washington, the first President of the United States, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which had been ceded by Britain in 1846 in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon Boundary Dispute.  It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital.  Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State or the State of Washington to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington. [PAR] Washington is the 18th largest with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people.  Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west, mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast and far southeast, and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.  Mount Rainier is the state's highest elevation at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 m). [PAR] Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. [PAR] Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The Washington Territory was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The area was originally part of a region called the Columbia District after the Columbia River. Incidentally, the area was renamed Washington in order to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, which contains the city of Washington.  [PAR] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president. To distinguish it from the U.S. capital, which is also named for George Washington, Washington is sometimes referred to as \"Washington State\", or, in more formal contexts, as \"the State of Washington\". Washingtonians and other residents of the Pacific Northwest refer to the state simply as \"Washington\", calling the nation's capital \"Washington, D.C.\" or, more often, simply \"D.C.\". [PAR] Geography [PAR] Washington is the northwestern-most state of the contiguous United States. Its northern border lies mostly along the 49th parallel, and then via marine boundaries through the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait and Strait of Juan de Fuca, with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. Washington is bordered by Oregon to the south, with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the southern boundary. [PAR] To the east, Washington borders Idaho, bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the confluence of the Snake River and Clearwater River (about 116\u00b057' west), except for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River. To the west of Washington lies the Pacific Ocean. [PAR] Washington",

[PAR] You are here: Home / Bible Q&A / Q&A Archive / What is the relationship of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam? [PAR] Bible Question: [PAR] It sounds as if Moses was the first born son according to Exodus 2:1-2, but then in Exodus 6:20 it lists Aaron and then Moses as brothers. Aaron is listed first so he would be the oldest. Where was Aaron when Moses was put in the basket by his mother? Did Moses and Aaron have the same parents? The Bible also mentions Miriam as Aaron's sister (Exodus 15:20) but why not Moses as well? Could you explain the family relationship of these three? [PAR] Bible Answer: [PAR] The three passages you refer to are presented below. [PAR] Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months. (NASB) Exodus 2:1-2 [PAR] And Amram married his father\u2019s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram\u2019s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. (NASB) Exodus 6:20 [PAR] And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron\u2019s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.Ex. 15:20 [PAR] First, we want to notice that the Bible does not provide any details about Aaron in the account of Moses in the basket (Exodus 2). Scripture never tries to give us all of the details because it is more interested in sending us a message. In both of the passages above, we are told that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam are the children of one father. His name was Amram. He was a Levite. [PAR] Other Proof? There are two other passages in the Old Testament that clearly tell us these three are brothers and a sister. The first passage is found in Numbers 26 and the second one is found in 1 Chronicles. [PAR] And the name of Amram\u2019s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. (NASB) Numbers 26:59 [PAR] And the children of Amram were Aaron, Moses, and Miriam . . . (NASB) 1 Chronicles 6:3 [PAR] The first passage says that their father was named Amram and their mother was Jochebed. From Exodus 2:1 we discovered that Amram was a Levite and from Numbers 26 we discover that Jochebed was a Levite too! Together Amram and Jochebed had two sons named Aaron and Moses and one daughter named Miriam. The second passage confirms the statement of the first one. [PAR] Moses and Aaron. From both of those passages, we discover that Aaron was the older brother, since he was listed first in each geneaology. It was customary in the Old Testament to list the first born son first. This is great news. God is more concerned about the heart of a person than about their lineage. I wonder how Moses felt when God told him that he was going to let his older brother speak for him, and how Aaron felt when Moses became the leader of Israel. [PAR] Conclusion: [PAR] The answer to that first question may be found in this verse, [PAR] Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth. (NASB) Numbers 12:3 [PAR] Moses was a very humble man. I believe that Moses did not react negatively to his brother\u2019s speaking for God before Moses. What a wonderful example to us. God calls us to serve Him and not worry about the other person. Praise the Lord.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] William the ConquerorWilliam I (Old Norman: Williame I; ; c. 1028Bates William the Conqueror p. 33\u00a0\u2013 9\u00a0September 1087), usually known as William the Conqueror and sometimes William the Bastard, was the first Norman King of England, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087. The descendant of Viking raiders, he had been Duke of Normandy since 1035. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son. [PAR] William was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine. [PAR] In the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him, and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent. [PAR] William's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey listing all the landholders in England along with their holdings. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire, but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, Robert, and his second surviving son, William, received England. [PAR] Background  [PAR] Norsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement surrendering the county of Rouen to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy.Collins Early Medieval Europe pp. 376\u2013377 Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 42\u201343 In an effort to improve matters, King \u00c6thelred the Unready took Emma of Normandy, sister of Duke Richard II, as his second wife in 1002.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 54\u201355 [PAR] Danish raids on England continued,",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  [PAR] In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. [PAR] Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

[PAR] History [PAR] Homer was relying on a Christmas bonus to buy presents, but didn't get it. He was relying on this bonus because the jar of Christmas money that Marge accumulates for the family's Christmas treats was disposed of to pay for the removal of a tattoo that Bart got on his arm. Homer took the small amount of Christmas money he made working as Santa Claus at the Springfield Mall and bet it at the dog track. He had inside information on what dog was going to win, but instead bet on the \"long shot,\" Santa's Little Helper, believing his name to be a sign. Santa's Little Helper finished last (apparently, it was the latest in a long string of last-place finishes), and his frustrated owner abandoned him. Homer and Bart brought him home, and everyone was so happy with him that it was a merry Christmas after all. [1] [PAR] Snowball II , Maggie and Santa's Little Helper together for a picture [PAR] Sometimes, Santa's Little Helper can be seen chewing on the newspaper and other objects in the Simpson's household (sometimes ignored or tolerated by the family), tearing up the furniture, digging holes in the backyard and eating food from the living room table. It is stated that Homer and Santa's Little Helper's birthdays are on the same day. [2] [PAR] With a few exceptions, Santa's Little Helper doesn't make any sound that resembles a bark. However, he does have an ability to think just like a person. Once, he made a sound similar to \"chewy\", and Homer writes it down in his review, amazed that the dog spoke English. [3] He is also shown to have ridden a circus ball on his hind legs and speak the phrase 'We love... you!' in an attempt to be given some attention from the Simpson family. [4] In addition, he was mascot of Duff Beer , and was known as Suds McDuff (a reference to a similar, real life mascot Spuds MacKenzie).

Due to his disobedience and destructive behavior nearly caused the Simpson family to give him away, but he passed an obedience class, thus he could stay. [6] Santa's Little Helper almost passed away from gastric torsion (referred to in the show as a \"twisting of the stomach\") because Homer initially couldn't afford $750 for the required operation. [7] He also broke two legs when Bart's treehouse was demolished by Mr. Burns ' slanted oil well drill (The latter of which caused Bart Simpson to hate Mr. Burns immensely). [8] Santa's Little Helper is sometimes a bad dog. [PAR] At one time, Santa's Little Helper was shortly abandoned by Bart for Laddie , a purebred and very well-trained dog he bought from a mail-order catalog together with various other expensive gifts and gadgets. To do that, Bart used a credit card he applied for under the name of his dog, yet the credit card company misread the form and issued a card to Mr. \"Santos L. Halper\". Laddie learned many tricks that Santa's Little Helper was completely unable to perform (most notably a back flip, CPR and using a toilet). The Simpson family nearly forgot about their old pet, and Bart eventually gave him away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tried to get Santa's Little Helper back. When he finally found him, Santa's Little Helper was serving as a guide dog for a blind man named Mr. Mitchell, but eventually chose to return to his former owner, Bart.

[PAR] Diana was born into a family of British nobility with royal ancestry as The Honourable Diana Spencer. She was the fourth child and third daughter of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp and the Honourable Frances Roche. She grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate, and was educated in England and Switzerland. In 1975, after her father inherited the title of Earl Spencer, she became Lady Diana Spencer. [PAR] Her wedding to the Prince of Wales on 29 July 1981, held at St Paul's Cathedral, reached a global television audience of over 750 million people. While married, Diana bore the titles Princess of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay, Countess of Chester, and Baroness of Renfrew. The marriage produced two sons, the princes William and Harry, who were then respectively second and third in the line of succession to the British throne. As Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions overseas. She was celebrated for her charity work and for her support of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. She was involved with dozens of charities including London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for children, of which she was president from 1989. [PAR] Diana remained the object of worldwide media scrutiny during and after her marriage, which ended in divorce on 28 August 1996. Media attention and public mourning were extensive after her death in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 and subsequent televised funeral. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Diana was born on 1 July 1961, in Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk. She was the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924\u20131992) and his first wife, Frances (n\u00e9e Roche; 1936\u20132004). The Spencer family has been closely allied with the British Royal Family for several generations. Both of Diana's grandmothers had served as ladies in waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Spencers were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after her mother and Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford, her distant relative who was also known as \"Lady Diana Spencer\" before marriage and was a prospective Princess of Wales. Diana was baptised at St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham. Diana had three siblings: Sarah, Jane, and Charles. Her infant brother, John, died shortly after his birth one year before Diana was born. The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was reportedly sent to Harley Street clinics in London to determine the cause of the \"problem\". The experience was described as \"humiliating\" by Diana's younger brother, Charles: \"It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it.\" Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate. The Spencers leased the house from its owner, Queen Elizabeth II. The Royal Family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with Princes Andrew and Edward as a child. [PAR] Diana was seven years old when her parents divorced. Her mother later had an affair with Peter Shand Kydd and married him in 1969. Diana lived with her mother in London during her parents' separation in 1967, but during that year's Christmas holidays, Lord Althorp refused to let Diana return to London with Lady Althorp. Shortly afterwards he won custody of Diana with support from his former mother-in-law, Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy. In 1972, Lord Althorp began a relationship with Raine, Countess of Dartmouth, the only daughter of Alexander McCorquodale and Dame Barbara Cartland. They married at Caxton Hall, London in 1976. Diana became known as Lady Diana after her father later inherited the title of Earl Spencer in 1975, at which point her father moved the entire family",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  [PAR] In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. [PAR] Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

He is a pompous, blustering figure with overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager, and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He believes in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. He is class conscious and a snob, considering himself upper-middle class and looking down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. His pretensions stand in contrast to Wilson , who is genuinely Upper Middle Class, Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's having attending public school, believing it made him 'wet', while his own state-school background is an attribute. Mainwaring and Wilson's relationship is mainly based on the fact that Mainwaring has always had to struggle and fight for everything in his life, whereas Wilson has just sat back and let it all come to him, (despite being a strong autocrat, Mainwaring fully believes that people should work and earn everything they get in life). Mainwaring is prudish and repressed, and can be judgemental about people who do not share his moral outlook. [PAR] Mainwaring [PAR] Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those he considers beneath him, and his arrogance is frequently punctured by circumstance and the people around him, such as Arthur Wilson , his chief clerk with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship, and Private Walker , a black-marketeer who interjects during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefitting from underhanded deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not, and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. [PAR] As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he is barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, and his plans result in chaos. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain of World War I. (In World War II, John Le Mesurier who played Wilson, had been a Captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major). He did, however, serve in the army of occupation in France, \"during the whole of 1919 \u2014 somebody had to clear up the mess.\" (He tried to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight; Arthur Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to World War II but was also rejected with poor eyesight.) [PAR] Despite his shortcomings as a leader, Mainwaring considers himself an excellent military tactician. His height and background is frequently demonstrated to show a Napoleon Complex; he is frequently referred to as 'Napoleon' by his nemesis Hodges . In one episode, A Soldier's Farewell , Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte , and is thwarted at the Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington looking like Wilson. His pomposity and conviction of his prowess see Mainwaring yearn to be in control of any situation, and he behaves in an arrogant manner; this is demonstrated by the first episode, in which he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience or qualifications (and had to wait until the episode Room at the Bottom before he received his commission). [PAR] In Command Decision he was prepared to relinquish control so the platoon could gain rifles, arguing defence of the country was more important than his ego. In addition he was prepared to \"march in the ranks as Private Mainwaring\" when he was briefly de-commissioned. This implied he was more overzealous than a control freak. [PAR] Mainwaring's patriotism can lead to xenophobia (he is not keen on the French because they are emotional, the Russians because their communism, and the Germans and the Italians because of them being such deadly enemies).

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Thunderbirds (TV series)Thunderbirds is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) and distributed by ITC Entertainment. It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series were filmed, comprising a total of 32 episodes. Production ceased after Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television. [PAR] Set in the mid-2060s, Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls, Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray. It follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from IR's secret base in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines. [PAR] Thunderbirds began its first run in the United Kingdom on the ITV network in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. As well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns, the series has been followed by two feature-length film sequels, a live-action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute. The second of two TV remakes, the computer-animated Thunderbirds Are Go, premiered in 2015. [PAR] Widely considered to be the Andersons' most popular and commercially successful series,  Thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects (directed by Derek Meddings) and musical score (composed by Barry Gray).

Its North helps form part of the Arctic alongside North America and Europe. Though most of its continental borders are clearly defined, there are gray areas. Europe and Asia are technically located on the same overall landmass, and combined the two are referred to as Eurasia. As a result of its porous land border, some countries on Asia\u2019s western border have been at times referred to as part of Europe\u2019s East. Armenia , Azerbaijan , and Georgia are sometimes referred to as Asian and other times as European. Russia and Turkey tend to be cut into regions. Russia is generally split along the Ural Mountains, with its western half called \u201cEuropean Russia\u201d and its East as simply \u201cRussia.\u201d The land between Turkey\u2019s largest city, Istanbul, and its direct borders with Bulgaria and Greece is at times referred to as a part of Europe called \u201cThrace,\u201d while the rest of its territory is called \u201cAnatolia\u201d and is part of Asia. [PAR] On the other side of the continent, the islands which separate Asia from Oceania can also be difficult to delineate. Indonesia and parts of the Philippines are sometimes categorized as part of Oceania rather than as Asian. This being said, it is important to note that these divided regions do not constitute separate countries or autonomous regions claiming sovereignty (such as the cases of Hong Kong or Palestine). \u201cEuropean Russia\u201d and \u201cRussia\u201d are both simply Russia, and the \u201cThrace\u201d and \u201cAnatolia\u201d parts of Turkey are both undisputedly part of Turkey, but sometimes the regions are shaded differently on maps in order to help delineate the borders between Asia and Europe.

Although definitions, names, and borders can vary, generally the regions of Asia include West Asia (which is part of the Middle East), the Caucasus (sometimes also considered as part of the Middle East), Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia (also called the India n Subcontinent), and Southeast Asia. West Asia is sometimes referred to as the Middle East, with is actually a misnomer since the cultural region we define as the Middle East often included countries outside of Asia, such as Egypt in Africa and Cyprus in Europe.

[PAR] You are here: Home / Bible Q&A / Q&A Archive / What is the relationship of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam? [PAR] Bible Question: [PAR] It sounds as if Moses was the first born son according to Exodus 2:1-2, but then in Exodus 6:20 it lists Aaron and then Moses as brothers. Aaron is listed first so he would be the oldest. Where was Aaron when Moses was put in the basket by his mother? Did Moses and Aaron have the same parents? The Bible also mentions Miriam as Aaron's sister (Exodus 15:20) but why not Moses as well? Could you explain the family relationship of these three? [PAR] Bible Answer: [PAR] The three passages you refer to are presented below. [PAR] Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months. (NASB) Exodus 2:1-2 [PAR] And Amram married his father\u2019s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram\u2019s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. (NASB) Exodus 6:20 [PAR] And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron\u2019s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.Ex. 15:20 [PAR] First, we want to notice that the Bible does not provide any details about Aaron in the account of Moses in the basket (Exodus 2). Scripture never tries to give us all of the details because it is more interested in sending us a message. In both of the passages above, we are told that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam are the children of one father. His name was Amram. He was a Levite. [PAR] Other Proof? There are two other passages in the Old Testament that clearly tell us these three are brothers and a sister. The first passage is found in Numbers 26 and the second one is found in 1 Chronicles. [PAR] And the name of Amram\u2019s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. (NASB) Numbers 26:59 [PAR] And the children of Amram were Aaron, Moses, and Miriam . . . (NASB) 1 Chronicles 6:3 [PAR] The first passage says that their father was named Amram and their mother was Jochebed. From Exodus 2:1 we discovered that Amram was a Levite and from Numbers 26 we discover that Jochebed was a Levite too! Together Amram and Jochebed had two sons named Aaron and Moses and one daughter named Miriam. The second passage confirms the statement of the first one. [PAR] Moses and Aaron. From both of those passages, we discover that Aaron was the older brother, since he was listed first in each geneaology. It was customary in the Old Testament to list the first born son first. This is great news. God is more concerned about the heart of a person than about their lineage. I wonder how Moses felt when God told him that he was going to let his older brother speak for him, and how Aaron felt when Moses became the leader of Israel. [PAR] Conclusion: [PAR] The answer to that first question may be found in this verse, [PAR] Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth. (NASB) Numbers 12:3 [PAR] Moses was a very humble man. I believe that Moses did not react negatively to his brother\u2019s speaking for God before Moses. What a wonderful example to us. God calls us to serve Him and not worry about the other person. Praise the Lord.

Their story is recorded by many authors including Virgil who claims their birth and adventures were fated in order for Rome to be founded. [PAR] The Birth & Parentage of Romulus & Remus [PAR] Romulus and Remus were the direct descendants of Aeneas, whose fate-driven adventures to discover Italy are described by Virgil in The Aeneid . Romulus and Remus were related to Aeneas through their mother's father, Numitor. Numitor was a king of Alba Longa, an ancient city of Latium in central Italy, and father to Rhea Silvia. Before Romulus' and Remus' conception, Numitor's reign was usurped by Nimitor's younger brother, Amulius. Amulius inherited control over Alba Longa's treasury with which he was able to dethrone Numitor and become king. Amulius, wishing to avoid any conflict of power, killed Nimitor's male heirs and forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin . Vestal Virgins were priestesses of Vesta , patron goddess of the hearth; they were charged with keeping a sacred fire that was never to be extinguished and to take vows of chastity. [PAR] Remove Ads [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] There is much debate and variation as to whom was the father of Romulus and Remus. Some myths claim that Mars appeared and lay with Rhea Silvia; other myths attest that the demi-god hero Hercules was her partner. However, the author Livy claims that Rhea Silvia was in fact raped by an unknown man, but blamed her pregnancy on divine conception. In either case, Rhea Silvia was discovered to be pregnant and gave birth to her sons. It was custom that any Vestal Virgin betraying her vows of celibacy was condemned to death; the most common death sentence was to be buried alive. However, King Amulius, fearing the wrath of the paternal god (Mars or Hercules) did not wish to directly stain his hands with the mother's and children's blood. So, King Amulius imprisoned Rhea Silvia and ordered the twins' death by means of live burial , exposure, or being thrown into the Tiber River. He reasoned that if the twins were to die not by the sword but by the elements, he and his city would be saved from punishment by the gods. He ordered a servant to carry out the death sentence, but in every scenario of this myth, the servant takes pity on the twins and spares their lives. The servant, then, places the twins into a basket onto the River Tiber, and the river carries the boys to safety. [PAR] The twins were first discovered by a she-wolf or lupa, who suckled them, and they were fed by a wood-pecker or picus. [PAR] The Discovery of Romulus & Remus [PAR] The river god Tibernus ensured their safety by calming the river, and he caused their basket to catch in the roots of a nearby fig tree. The tree was located at the base of the Palatine Hill in the Velabrum swamp. The twins were first discovered by a she-wolf or lupa, who suckled them and they were fed by a wood-pecker or picus. Eventually, they were discovered and cared for by a shepherd and his wife: Faustulus and Acca Larentia.The two boys grew up to be shepherds like their adoptive father. One day while they were herding their sheep, they were met by shepherds of King Amulius. These shepherds started a fight with Romulus and Remus in which Remus was captured and taken before King Amulius. Romulus gathered and incited a band of local shepherds to join him in rescuing his brother. King Amulius believed that Rhea Silvia's children were dead; he did not recognize Remus or Romulus. Romulus freed his brother, and in the process killed King Amulius. [PAR] Romulus & Remus Begin to Quarrel [PAR] After Amulius' death, the brothers rejected the citizens' offer of the crown",

[PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was a dominant and controversial figure in Victorian England and the leading British statesman of the 19th century. He served in the British government from the 1830s to the 1890s, and as Prime Minister of Britain on four occasions he reformed both British government and society. [PAR] Gladstone is often viewed as the moral and political voice of the Victorian era, yet he was famously disliked by Queen Victoria . [PAR] One of Gladstone's lifelong obsessions was the \"rescuing\" of English prostitutes, and his activities in that regard made some question his motivations and even his sanity. [PAR] Early Life of Gladstone [PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was born on December 29, 1809 in Liverpool. His family was of Scottish descent, and his father, Sir John Gladstone, became a wealthy merchant in the port city of Liverpool and had investments in slave plantations in the West Indies. [PAR] After being educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, Gladstone took a trip to Italy and then returned to Britain and was elected to Parliament. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Though he would become the leader of the Liberal Party, he was first elected as a Tory. His first address in Parliament was a defense of slave owners in the West Indies, in which he used his father as an example. [PAR] Gladstone's Politics Shifted from Conservative to Liberal [PAR] In the British government Gladstone was at first aligned with Sir Robert Peel, but throughout the 1840s Gladstone\u2019s politics evolved until he began taking positions more in line with the Liberal party. A trip to Naples in the early 1850s, where he witnessed extreme poverty, may have helped drive him away from Tory orthodoxy. [PAR] In the 1850s Gladstone served as chancellor of the exchequer, the chief financial officer of the British government, and was influential in passing financial reforms, including the abolition of many taxes and tariffs. [PAR] Leader of\u00a0the Liberal Party [PAR] In the late 1850s Gladstone gravitated toward a newly formulated Liberal party and became its leader. [PAR] Gladstone's party won an overwhelming majority in the elections of 1868, and he became prime minister. He focused on reforms, which were often targeted at reducing the influence of privilege and making British institutions, such as civil service and the military, open to those beyond the privileged classes. [PAR] Gladstone and the Issue of Irish Home Rule: [PAR] Gladstone served four terms as prime minister: [PAR] 1868-1874 [PAR] 1886 [PAR] 1892-94 [PAR] During his first term as prime minister Gladstone pushed reforms intended to improve the lot of the Irish peasantry. In fact, Gladstone became intensely interested in the \"Irish question,\" and many of his ideas for reform were focused on Britain's administration of Ireland . [PAR] Gladstone, throughout the late 1800s, often advocated \"home rule\" for Ireland. While it wasn't a call for outright Irish independence, it was considered by many a radical position. [PAR] Bitter Rivalry With Benjamin Disraeli [PAR] The other leading political player in Victorian Britain was Benjamin Disraeli, who, like Gladstone, held a variety of government posts and served as Prime Minister. For decades Gladstone and Disraeli were rivals, and it is known that they detested each other. [PAR] The two men came from very opposite backgrounds, and while they were both highly intelligent, they often battled on opposite sides of an issue. And they also had different relationships with Queen Victoria, who liked Disraeli and complained bitterly of Gladstone's attitude toward her. [PAR] Gladstone's Attacks on Disraeli Were Effective [PAR] Gladstone was opposed to Britain's imperial foreign policy. And in the late 1870s, while out of power, he published a controversial pamphlet attacking the foreign policy of Benjamin Disraeli , who was the current prime minister. [PAR] The title of the pamphlet, \"Bulgarian Horrors and the Questions of the East\" seems utterly obscure today, but Britain's policy in the near-east was a huge topic of debate at the",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Captain George Mainwaring - Dad's Army Wiki - WikiaCaptain George Mainwaring | Dad's Army Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia [PAR] Edit [PAR] George Mainwaring was born in 1885. He is a pompous, blustering figure with overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager, and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He believes in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. He is class conscious and a snob, considering himself upper-middle class and looking down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. His pretensions stand in contrast to Wilson , who is genuinely Upper Middle Class, Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's having attending public school, believing it made him 'wet', while his own state-school background is an attribute. Mainwaring and Wilson's relationship is mainly based on the fact that Mainwaring has always had to struggle and fight for everything in his life, whereas Wilson has just sat back and let it all come to him, (despite being a strong autocrat, Mainwaring fully believes that people should work and earn everything they get in life). Mainwaring is prudish and repressed, and can be judgemental about people who do not share his moral outlook. [PAR] Mainwaring [PAR] Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those he considers beneath him, and his arrogance is frequently punctured by circumstance and the people around him, such as Arthur Wilson , his chief clerk with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship, and Private Walker , a black-marketeer who interjects during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefitting from underhanded deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not, and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. [PAR] As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he is barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, and his plans result in chaos. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain of World War I. (In World War II, John Le Mesurier who played Wilson, had been a Captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major). He did, however, serve in the army of occupation in France, \"during the whole of 1919 \u2014 somebody had to clear up the mess.\" (He tried to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight; Arthur Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to World War II but was also rejected with poor eyesight.) [PAR] Despite his shortcomings as a leader, Mainwaring considers himself an excellent military tactician. His height and background is frequently demonstrated to show a Napoleon Complex; he is frequently referred to as 'Napoleon' by his nemesis Hodges . In one episode, A Soldier's Farewell , Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte , and is thwarted at the Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington looking like Wilson. His pomposity and conviction of his prowess see Mainwaring yearn to be in control of any situation, and he behaves in an arrogant manner; this is demonstrated by the first episode, in which he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience or qualifications (and had to wait until the episode Room at the Bottom before he received his commission). [PAR] In Command Decision he was prepared to relinquish control so the platoon could gain rifles, arguing defence of the country was more important than his ego. In addition he was prepared to \"march in the ranks as Private Mainwaring\" when he was briefly de-commissioned. This implied he was more overzealous than a control freak. [PAR] Mainwaring's patriotism can lead to xenophobia (he is not keen on the French because they are emotional, the Russians because their communism, and the Germans and the Italians because of them being such deadly enemies). Mainwaring often refers to Hitler and the Germans as if he is leading his",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Artwork highlights - Bubbles, by Sir John Everett MillaisArtwork details, Liverpool museums [PAR] See a larger version [PAR] About the artwork [PAR] One of the most famous paintings by the Victorian artist Sir John Millais has been placed on long loan at the Lady Lever Art Gallery. It has been lent by Unilever. [PAR] 'Bubbles' was painted in 1885-6. It shows a boy blowing bubbles with a pipe and a bowl of soap suds. The boy was the artist\u2019s grandson, Willie James, aged about four: he later became an Admiral. To get round the problems of painting the bubbles, the artist had a glass sphere specially manufactured. Millais originally titled his painting 'A Child\u2019s World' but it was later changed to 'Bubbles'. [PAR] As a young man, Millais was one of the chief artists in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , which set out to attack the complacency of the Royal Academy. He painted masterpieces such as 'Isabella' ( Walker Art Gallery ) and ' Ophelia ' ( Tate Britain ) in a new style with bright colours, wiry outlines and minute detail. By the time he painted 'Bubbles', Millais was in his 50s. He had abandoned the Pre-Raphaelite style and had adopted darker colours and looser brushwork.\u00a0 No longer a rebel, he had joined the Royal Academy and had become a pillar of the art establishment. Much of his work at this stage in his career featured sentimental portrayals of small children. Other examples, at the Lady Lever Art Gallery, are 'Little Speedwell\u2019s Darling Blue' and 'The Nest'. [PAR] Although 'Bubbles' may appear sentimental to modern taste, it has a serious meaning. Millais was using a symbol with a long tradition behind it. 'Bubbles' are fragile and have a brief moment of beauty before they burst. In the 17th century Dutch artists painted children blowing bubbles to convey the brevity of human life, the transience of beauty and the inevitability of death. This theme appealed to Millais and is a key to several other of his paintings, such as ' Spring (Apple Blossoms) ' also at the Lady Lever Art Gallery. Amongst the beauty of the young girls and the spring flowers in this picture, Millais painted a scythe, to indicate that beauty fades and that death awaits us all. [PAR] This aspect of 'Bubbles' was not obvious to the Victorians. Victorian artists associated childhood with sweetness and innocence. The attitude is seen in the book illustrations of Kate Greenaway and in historical pictures such as 'And when did you last see your father?' by\u00a0 W. F. Yeames (Walker Art Gallery). It had also been seen in the 18th century in pictures like ' The Age of Innocence ' (Tate Britain) by Sir Joshua Reynolds , who was much admired by Millais. The interpretation of childhood changed radically after Freud wrote about it as a troubled period of latent sexuality, but it would be unhistorical to expect Millais to reflect these ideas in his work. [PAR] Listen to a recording of Julian Treuherz's gallery talk on 'Bubbles' online now . [PAR] The painting was brought from Millais by Sir William Ingram, proprietor of the Illustrated London News, a popular magazine with a wide circulation. Ingram also bought the copyright from the artist. He published 'Bubbles' as a special presentation colour print with the Christmas number of the magazine in 1887. (Other paintings of children by Millais had been published with previous Christmas numbers with great success.) [PAR] Before its appearance in the magazine, the painting with its copyright was sold to A & F Pears, manufacturers of Pears soap. The Managing Director of Pears, Thomas Barrett, was a pioneer of modern advertising methods, and he and William Lever of Lever Brothers, makers of Sunlight Soap, were great rivals, each spending vast sums on promoting their brands. [PAR] Barrett turned 'Bubbles' into an advertisement by adding a bar of soap in the foreground. Millais was furious, but he could do nothing about it. Millais was unfairly criticised for degrading his art, but as the copyright owner, Barrett was within his rights.\u00a0 And the use of",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Male Vocal Range and Voice Type - Personal Singing GuideMale Vocal Range and Voice Type | Your Personal Singing Guide [PAR] Male Vocal Range [PAR] and Voice Types! [PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for males, and this section will discuss the 4 main types of male voices, their respective pitch ranges, unique tonal characteristics, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One important point to note: These 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type \u2013 are not to be confused with each other. [PAR] The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that our voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas the Type of Voice refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to understand more about how to find your own vocal range, as well as how to determine your own voice type using the various criteria! [PAR] Now, the 4 main types of male voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Countertenor [PAR] Let us look at each of these male voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. COUNTERTENOR [PAR] The Countertenor Voice may actually be unfamiliar to those of us not from the classical realm, as many of us would probably only have heard of the 3 main male voices \u2013 Tenor, Baritone and Bass. [PAR] The Countertenor voice is the highest of the adult male voice types, and has a vocal range that is similar to that of the Female Contralto Voice, the lowest of the female voice types! In the Mandarin pop scene, certain singers like Jeff Chang and the lead singer of popular pop rock band Soda Green would probably qualify as countertenor voices! [PAR] An approximate Countertenor Vocal Range would be from a G note below the middle C (G3) to a high F one octave above the middle C (F5). Be sure to support your voice well with your breath so as to get a more accurate representation of the range in your voice. Check out the section on \u2018How to Find Your Singing Range and Voice Type\u2019 to get some tips on finding your range on your own! [PAR] Also, the Tessitura or most comfortable singing range for Countertenors lies above that of the Tenor and other adult male voices. The Countertenor voice would usually be able to sing the high head voice notes with great ease and brightness in tone, and would often be confused by many listeners with regular female voices. [PAR] 2. TENOR [PAR] The Tenor Voice is the highest of the main male vocal types that most people would be familiar with, with the typical tenor vocal range lying between the C note one octave below middle C (C3) to the C note one octave above middle C (C5)! This means that it would lie just slightly below the Countertenor voice, but has similar characteristics in the sense that the Tenor would also be able to sing most high notes with ease and vocalize the head voice notes with strength and brightness! [PAR] The Tenor voice would probably transition into his middle voice around the D or E note above middle C (D4 or E4) and shift into head voice around the F sharp or G above middle C (F4 or G4). The tenor tessitura would lie between that of the Countertenor\u2019s and the Baritone\u2019s. Do make sure that we avoid certain common singing problems like jaw tightness when we attempt to find out where our vocal register transitions lie, as this will affect the notes at which we transition, affecting the voice type we may classify ourselves to be! [PAR] Famous Tenor voices include the 3 Tenors \u2013 Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as well as other classical singers like Enrico Caruso and pop singers like Elton John, Stevie Wonder. In the Mandarin pop scene, JJ Lin Junjie and Jay Chou would probably be considered Tenor voices too! [PAR] 3. BARITONE [PAR] Most men would have a vocal range similar to that of a Baritone voice, as this is the most common of the male voice types! A typical Baritone Voice Range would be between the A flat note one",

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village. Sixty nations boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while the Soviets and",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ScrabbleScrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a gameboard which is divided into a 15\u00d715 grid of squares. The tiles must form words which, in crossword fashion, flow left to right in rows or downwards in columns. The words must be defined in a standard dictionary, or present in specified reference works (e.g., the Official Tournament and Club Word List, the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), which provide a list of officially permissible words. [PAR] The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the United States and Canada and has been sold by Hasbro's Parker Brothers division since 1999. Prior to 1999, it was sold as a Milton Bradley game. Outside the United States and Canada, Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel. The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a Scrabble set.   There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world. [PAR] Game details [PAR] The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15\u00d715 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. [PAR] In official club and tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack. [PAR] The board is marked with \"premium\" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red \"triple-word\" squares, 17 pink \"double-word\" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol; 12 dark blue \"triple-letter\" squares, and 24 light blue \"double-letter\" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL. Despite this, the original premium square color scheme is still the preferred scheme for Scrabble boards used in tournaments.  [PAR] In an English-language set, the game contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points of each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English writing; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values. [PAR] Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are 19 x square and 4 mm thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition varies the width up to 2 mm for different letters.  Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. 13 x); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner. [PAR] S is the most valuable letter in English-language Scrabble because it easily goes on the ends of words; Alfred Butts included only four instances to avoid a game that was \"too easy\". Q is considered the most problematic letter, as most words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German. J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end.  C and V may be troublesome in the endgame, since no two-letter words with them exist, save for CH in SOWPODS. [PAR] History [PAR] In 1938, American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented called Lexiko. The two games",

Founded by Canadian environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace states its goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity\"  and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants.

[PAR] Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world.   Greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge,    and influenced both the private and the public sector.   Greenpeace has also been a source of controversy;  its motives and methods (some of the latter being illegal) have received criticism,  including an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The organization's direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists,   such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat[http://www.biofortified.org/2013/06/gmo-crops-vandalized-in-oregon/ GMO crops vandalized in Oregon], Karl Haro von Mogel, Biology Fortified, 24 June 2013. and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site in Peru.  [PAR] History [PAR] Origins [PAR] In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000  people blocked a major U.S.\u2013Canadian border crossing in British Columbia, carrying signs reading \"Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes\".  The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb. [PAR] While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opposers were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. As members of the Sierra Club Canada, they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization. From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, \"bearing witness\", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence. Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club. The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay St. became the HQ.  As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, Greenpeace, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's \"quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance\". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.  Within half a year Greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in Kitsilano.  [PAR] Irving Stowe arranged a benefit concert (supported by Joan Baez) that took place on October 16, 1970 at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver.

Pastorino, Commercial Attach\u00e9, 1974-77 [PAR] On April 25, 1974, Portugal experienced a coup like no other. In an era characterized by the clash of ideologies and power players, the nearly bloodless revolution became known as the Carnation Revolution. What began as a military revolution led by the Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas (MAF) quickly became a mass movement of civil unrest. [PAR] Dictator Marcello Caetano resisted the independence of Portuguese colonies for as long as possible, forcing soldiers to take de-colonization efforts into their own hands. Much of the planning for the revolution took place outside the country, in places like Angola, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique. The Carnation Revolution led to tensions in Portuguese-U.S. relations as the American government believed a Communist victory was imminent. The revolution ended in the peaceful overthrow of Caetano and the Estado Novo or the Second Republic, which had been the installed in 1933 and was the longest surviving regime in Western Europe. [PAR] The Carnation Revolution introduced a new Constitution, the end of Portuguese colonialism, as well as civil liberties which had previously been banned under Caetano's government. Today, April 25 is celebrated as Portuguese Freedom Day and is also the name of Lisbon's version of the Golden Gate Bridge. [PAR] This account was compiled from interviews by ADST with James A.

Shorty Slade from \"The Gunmen\", and Angus Borden from \"Alias Joe Cartwright\". [PAR] Ben's \"criminal twin\" was a con artist named Bradley Meredith, whose schemes to gain control of the Ponderosa (usually through gambling) come when Ben is out of the area on business. The two episodes featuring Meredith aired as season finales in 1971 and 1972 (with another planned for 1973, had the series continued), and Ben always arrives back home in time to gather enough ammunition to run Bradley out. [PAR] Cultured Badass : The Cartwrights. For all their salt-of-the-earthiness and willingness to get their hands dirty, the Cartwrights have fashionable town-clothes, a large, lavishly but tastefully decorated home and modern, expensive weapons. Ben Cartwright is also partial to fine French wines, Ch\u00e2teau Lafite in particular. [PAR] Dark Is Not Evil : Adam's main outfit is completely black, occasionally with a splash of color, and he's probably the broodiest of the bunch. Yet he's still loyal to his family and won't hesitate to help anyone in need. [PAR] Deadpan Snarker : Adam is typically the one to take on this role. [PAR] Death Glare : Ben Cartwright is quite skilled in death glares; a particularly outstanding one can be seen in the final scene of \"The Gift\". [PAR] Defeat Means Friendship : Hoss and Arnie become fast friends in The Ape after fighting to a draw. Due to a misunderstanding, neither one of them knew what they were actually fighting over. [PAR] Distinguished Gentleman's Pipe : Ben is occasionally seen with one, as befits both a patriarch and a former sailor. [PAR] Distressed Dude : All the Cartwrights have found themselves held hostage at some point. Little Joe is certainly the worst offender. [PAR] Downer Ending : It's not uncommon in dramatic episodes for a good character to die within the last minute of the episode's runtime. [PAR] Early Installment Weirdness : The Cartwrights in the early episodes often confronted strangers in the Ponderosa in a hostile fashion with guns drawn. Lorne Greene convinced the producers that since the Cartwrights are such major landowners and a major business interest in the region, they logically would be more hospitable to visitors for economic, social and political purposes. [PAR] Funny Foreigner : The Chinese Laborer Hop Sing \u2014 though nowadays , not so much .

When she was exposed, she left town with another man. [PAR] In the 1972-1973 season premiere \"Forever,\" Little Joe's tragic bride Alice Harper has a brother, John, who is a hopeless gambling addict on the run from a ruthless gambler named Sloan. Sloan and his henchmen kill both John and Alice when they break into the home of Joe and Alice Cartwright (when Joe wasn't home) in an attempt to collect the debt. [PAR] Gorgeous Period Dress : Frequently, and often turns out to be the same dress . [PAR] Green Aesop : Quite frequently. The Cartwrights took their stewardship of their land seriously, refusing to allow activities that were not sustainable (such as over-logging) and it was shown in multiple episodes that whenever they did cut down a tree, they planted a new one to replace it.

Unable to afford to go to university, he worked in an insurance office until he was 27, when he joined Preston repertory company and made his professional stage debut in The Gay Dog. After Preston, he starred in productions at Wolverhampton, Salisbury and The Old Vic Company at Bristol's Theatre Royal. In 1962 he made his first big-screen appearance in A Kind of Loving, followed by other films throughout the 1960s, including Billy Liar, King Rat and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and TV appearances such as Z Cars, The Avengers and Steptoe and Son. His portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the 1969 play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui made him a West End star.

The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially called the Academy Award of Merit, which has become commonly known by its nickname \"Oscar.\" The awards, first presented in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, are overseen by AMPAS.   [PAR] The awards ceremony was first broadcast to radio in 1930 and televised in 1953. It is now seen live in more than 200 countries and can be streamed live online.  The Oscars is the oldest entertainment awards ceremony; its equivalents, the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theatre, and the Grammy Awards for music and recording, are modeled after the Academy Awards.  [PAR] The 88th Academy Awards ceremony was held at the Dolby Theatre on February 28, 2016 and hosted by Chris Rock. A total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award through the 87th.  [PAR] History [PAR] The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people. The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.  The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($ in  dollars). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927\u201328 period. The ceremony ran for 15\u00a0minutes. [PAR] Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00\u00a0pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until an occasion when the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners. [PAR] Institutions [PAR] The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. [PAR] At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award. [PAR] The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. [PAR] Since 1972, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture. [PAR] Oscar statuette [PAR] Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, the Gordon E.

It was originally serialized in the children's magazine Young Folks between 1881 through 1882 under the title Treasure Island, or the mutiny of the Hispaniola, credited to the pseudonym \"Captain George North\". It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell & Co. [PAR] Treasure Island is traditionally considered a coming-of-age story, and is noted for its atmosphere, characters, and action. It is also noted as a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality\u2014as seen in Long John Silver\u2014unusual for children's literature. It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels. Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements as treasure maps marked with an \"X\", schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.Cordingly, David (1995) Under the Black Flag: the romance and reality of life among the pirates; p.  7 [PAR] Plot summary [PAR] ; PART I\u2014\"THE OLD BUCCANEER\" [PAR] An old sailor, calling himself \"the captain\"\u2014real name \"Billy\" Bones\u2014comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow Inn on the west English coast during the mid-1700s, paying the innkeeper's son, Jim Hawkins, a few pennies to keep a lookout for a one-legged \"seafaring man.\" A seaman with intact legs shows up, frightening Billy\u2014who drinks far too much rum\u2014into a stroke, and Billy tells Jim that his former shipmates covet the contents of his sea chest. After a visit from yet another man, Billy has another stroke and dies; Jim and his mother (his father has also died just a few days before) unlock the sea chest, finding some money, a journal, and a map. The local physician, Dr. Livesey, deduces that the map is of an island where a deceased pirate\u2014Captain Flint\u2014buried a vast treasure. The district squire, Trelawney, proposes buying a ship and going after the treasure, taking Livesey as ship's doctor and Jim as cabin boy. [PAR] ; PART II\u2014\"THE SEA COOK\" [PAR] Several weeks later, Trelawney sends for Jim and Livesey and introduces them to \"Long John\" Silver, a one-legged Bristol tavern-keeper whom he has hired as ship's cook. (Silver enhances his outre attributes\u2014crutch, pirate argot, etc.\u2014with a talking parrot.) They also meet Captain Smollett, who tells them that he dislikes most of the crew on the voyage, which it seems everyone in Bristol knows is a search for treasure. After taking a few precautions, however, they set sail on Trelawny's schooner, the Hispaniola, for the distant island. During the voyage the first mate, a drunkard, disappears overboard. And just before the island is sighted, Jim\u2014concealed in an apple barrel\u2014overhears Silver talking with two other crewmen.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe given question is \"Spyglass Hill, Skeleton Island, White Rock and Haulbowline Head all feature in which literary location?\" and the answer provided is \"benbow inn\". Upon analyzing the context, it becomes clear that the question is referring to locations within the narrative of \"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. The context describes various events and locations from the novel, such as the Admiral Benbow Inn, where the story begins, and other geographical features mentioned in the narrative.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that the answer \"benbow inn\" is not directly related to the locations listed in the question (Spyglass Hill, Skeleton Island, White Rock, and Haulbowline Head). Instead, these locations are actually associated with the island where Captain Flint's treasure is buried, as described in the novel.\n\nTo correct this, we need to identify the correct literary location that encompasses these geographical features. The correct location is actually \"Treasure Island\", not \"benbow inn\". The Admiral Benbow Inn is the starting point of the story, but it is not where Spyglass Hill, Skeleton Island, White Rock, and Haulbowline Head are located. These features are part of the island that the characters sail to in search of the treasure.\n\nThus, the correct answer should relate to the island that is central to the plot of \"Treasure Island\".\n\n</document_analysis>\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the literary location that features Spyglass Hill, Skeleton Island, White Rock, and Haulbowline Head?\nA: The Admiral Benbow Inn\nB: Treasure Island\nC: The Hispaniola\nD: Bristol Harbour\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B: Treasure Island, as Spyglass Hill, Skeleton Island, White Rock, and Haulbowline Head are geographical features on the island where Captain Flint's treasure is buried, as described in \"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

See more photos from Ken Christison. [PAR] The North Star or Pole Star \u2013 aka Polaris \u2013 is famous for holding nearly still in our sky while the entire northern sky moves around it. That\u2019s because it\u2019s located nearly at the north celestial pole, the point around which the entire northern sky turns. Polaris marks the way due north. As you face Polaris and stretch your arms sideways, your right hand points due east, and your left hand points due west. About-face of Polaris steers you due south. Polaris is not the brightest star in the nighttime sky, as is commonly believed. It\u2019s only about 50th brightest.

[PAR] That fact has made this star a boon to travelers throughout the Northern Hemisphere, both over land and sea. Finding Polaris means you know the direction north. [PAR] Best of all, Polaris is readily found by using the prominent group of stars known as the Big Dipper , called the Plough in the UK, which may be the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s most famous star pattern. [PAR] To locate Polaris, all you have to do is to find the Big Dipper pointer stars Dubhe and Merak. These two stars outline the outer part of the Big Dipper\u2019s bowl. Simply draw a line from Merak through Dubhe, and go about 5 times the Merak/Dubhe distance to Polaris. [PAR] The Big Dipper, like a great big hour hand, goes full circle around Polaris in one day. More specifically, the Big Dipper circles Polaris in a counter-clockwise direction in 23 hours and 56 minutes.

It\u2019s famous for hardly moving while the other stars wheel around it. And it\u2019s famous for marking the end of the Little Dipper \u2018s handle.

[PAR] Dates: May 24, 1819 - January 22, 1901 [PAR] Reign: 1837 - 1901 [PAR] Also Known As: Alexandrina Victoria of the House of Hanover; \"the Grandmother of Europe\" [PAR] The Girl Who Would Be Queen [PAR] Queen Victoria was born at Kensington Palace on May 24, 1819 to Edward, the Duke of Kent (and fourth son of King George III) and German Princess Victoire of Leiningen. Although Victoria was fifth in line to the throne - unlikely to become monarch - the duke feared that any future claim to the throne might be challenged if she were born abroad.

[PAR] Christened Alexandrina Victoria at birth, the child came to be called Victoria. Despite being born into royalty, she did not grow up surrounded by wealth. Edward's spendthrift ways had left him with many debts. [PAR] The duke and duchess, in an attempt to reduce expenses, moved with their infant daughter to a modest home. Not long after the move, Edward became ill and died of pneumonia on January 23, 1820 (Victoria was just eight months old). Six days later, King George III died as well, thus making George IV King of England. [PAR] Victoria was now third in line to the throne behind her two uncles, who had failed to produce heirs. [PAR] Victoria's Less Than Royal Childhood [PAR] King George IV , whose only legitimate child had died in childbirth, was resentful of his brother's daughter. He begrudgingly allowed Victoria and her mother to move into an apartment at Kensington Palace, but would only approve a small allowance. The duchess\u2019s brother, Prince Leopold (later King Leopold I\u00a0of Belgium ), agreed to pay for Victoria's upbringing and education. [PAR] Tutors were hired to school Victoria in history, math, drawing, and languages. Raised by a German mother who spoke little English, Victoria spoke mostly German the first few years of her life, but readily learned both English and French. [PAR] In 1827, when Victoria was eight, her Uncle Frederick, the Duke of York, died, placing her one step closer to the throne. [PAR] A Scheming Pair [PAR] When newly widowed, Victoria's mother had turned for advice to John Conroy, a colleague of her late husband. In the years following the duke's death, the self-serving Conroy convinced the duchess that she should have herself declared Victoria's regent (an agent acting on behalf of an incapacitated or underage monarch) in the event that Victoria became queen while still a minor. In this way, Conroy - through the duchess - could essentially control the throne. [PAR] When King George IV (who loathed Conroy and the duchess) died in 1830, the pair believed they could easily persuade newly-crowned King William IV to name the duchess as Victoria's regent. But King William did not trust the duchess and refused her request. The duchess petitioned Parliament, winning approval as Victoria's sole regent in 1831. [PAR] The regency proved unnecessary. On June 20, 1837, a month after Victoria's eighteenth birthday, King William died, making",

During her time in office, she reduced the influence of trade unions, privatized certain industries, scaled back public benefits and changed the terms of political debate, much like her friend and ideological ally, U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Nicknamed the \u201cIron Lady,\u201d she opposed Soviet communism and fought a war to maintain control of the Falkland Islands. The longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century, Thatcher was eventually pressured into resigning by members of her own Conservative Party [PAR] Google [PAR] Margaret Thatcher: The Early Years [PAR] Margaret Hilda Roberts, later Margaret Thatcher, was born on October 13, 1925, in Grantham, a small town in Lincolnshire, England. Her parents, Alfred and Beatrice, were middle-class shopkeepers and devout Methodists. Alfred was also a politician, serving as a town council member for 16 years before becoming an alderman in 1943 and mayor of Grantham from 1945 to 1946. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 2007 Margaret Thatcher became the first living ex-prime minister in British history to be honored with a statue in the Houses of Parliament. It stands opposite a statue of Winston Churchill in the lobby of the House of Commons. [PAR] Thatcher matriculated at Oxford University in 1943, during the height of World War II . While there she studied chemistry and joined the Oxford Union Conservative Association, becoming president of the organization in 1946. After graduation she worked as a research chemist, but her real interest was politics. In 1950 she ran for parliament in the Labour-dominated constituency of Dartford, using the slogan \u201cVote Right to Keep What\u2019s Left.\u201d She lost that year and again in 1951, but received more votes than previous Conservative Party candidates. [PAR] Margaret Thatcher Enters Parliament [PAR] In December 1951 Margaret married Denis Thatcher, a wealthy businessman. Less than two years later she gave birth to twins, Carol and Mark. Meanwhile, she was studying for the bar exams, which she passed in early 1954. She then spent the next few years practicing law and looking for a winnable constituency. [PAR] Thatcher ran for parliament once more in 1959\u2014this time in the Conservative-dominated constituency of Finchley\u2014and easily won the seat. The first bill she introduced affirmed the right of the media to cover local government meetings. Speaking about the bill in her maiden speech, she focused not on freedom of the press but instead on the need to limit wasteful government expenditures\u2014a common theme throughout her political career. [PAR] By 1961 Thatcher had accepted an invitation to become parliamentary undersecretary in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. She then steadily moved up the ministerial ranks, becoming secretary of state for education and science when the Conservatives retook power in 1970. The following year she was demonized by her Labour Party opponents as \u201cThatcher the milk snatcher\u201d when she eliminated a free milk program for schoolchildren. Nonetheless, she was able to keep her job, and in 1975, with the Conservatives back in the opposition, she defeated former Prime Minister Edward Heath to take over leadership of the party.

His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide. [PAR] Born in Wales to Norwegian parents, Dahl served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, in which he became a flying ace and intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander. He rose to prominence in the 1940s with works for both children and adults and he became one of the world's best-selling authors. He has been referred to as \"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\". His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008, The Times placed Dahl 16th on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". [PAR] Dahl's short stories are known for their unexpected endings and his children's books for their unsentimental, macabre, often darkly comic content, featuring villainous adult enemies of the child characters.  His books champion the kind-hearted, and feature an underlying warm sentiment. Dahl's works for children include James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda,  The Witches, Fantastic Mr Fox, The BFG, The Twits and George's Marvellous Medicine. His adult works include Tales of the Unexpected. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Childhood  [PAR] Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (n\u00e9e Hesselberg).  Dahl's father had emigrated to the UK from Sarpsborg, Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s. His mother came over and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild and Else. Dahl and his sisters were raised in the Lutheran faith, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff, where their parents worshipped.  [PAR] In 1920, when Dahl was three years old, his seven-year-old sister, Astri, died from appendicitis. Weeks later, his father died of pneumonia at the age of 57. With the option of returning to Norway to live with relatives, Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales, because Harald had wished to have their children educated in British schools, which he considered the world's best.  [PAR] Dahl first attended the Cathedral School, Llandaff. At the age of eight, he and four of his friends (one named Thwaites) were caned by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of gobstoppers at the local sweet shop, which was owned by a \"mean and loathsome\" old woman called Mrs Pratchett. This was known among the five boys as the \"Great Mouse Plot of 1924\".  A favourite sweet among British schoolboys between the two World Wars, Dahl would later refer to gobstoppers in his literary creation, Everlasting Gobstopper.  [PAR] Thereafter, he transferred to a boarding school in England: St Peter's in Weston-super-Mare. Roald's parents had wanted him to be educated at an English public school and, because of a then regular ferry link across the Bristol Channel, this proved to be the nearest. His time at St Peter's was an unpleasant experience for him. He was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed to her his unhappiness. Only after her death in 1967 did he find out that she had saved every single one of his letters, in small bundles held together with green tape.  In 2016, to mark the centenary of Dahl's birth, his letters to his mother were abridged and broadcast as BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week.

[PAR] The TV spots, and the characters, were directed by Darren Walsh at Passion Pictures. Walsh has directed all of the meerkat television and cinema commercials to date, and has won several awards for the work. In the adverts, Orlov is voiced by Simon Greenall.  [PAR] In August 2009 an opinion piece in The Guardian newspaper accused the advert series of racism for mocking Eastern European accents. However, the Advertising Standards Authority, following a complaint by the author of the article, stated that it had not received any similar complaints.  [PAR] In November 2012, Compare the Market began sponsoring the long-running soap opera Coronation Street as part of a three-year deal with producers of the series. [PAR] In April 2015, comparethemarket.com launched Meerkat Movies, offering customers two-for-one cinema tickets. They partnered with films such as  [PAR] Terminator Genisys and Ant-Man. The advertisements featured the movie trailer, sometimes an interview between Orlov and the cast, and a comment that the movie tickets are two-for-one with Meerkat Movies. [PAR] Characters [PAR] The adverts are fronted by Aleksandr Orlov, a meerkat. According to an interview with the character's designer and director, Darren Walsh at Passion Pictures, Orlov became a billionaire in the 1970s. He is described as living in Moscow, while owning a large mansion in South London, and spends his time on vanity projects such as his website, numerous self-portraits, petitions and film production. [PAR] The campaign has also featured secondary characters from amongst Orlov's friends, family and employees. Most notably Sergei, Orlov's sidekick and technician who has also featured in his own adverts. In the adverts, Sergei is Orlov's IT technician, tea-maker and sidekick. Before working for Aleksandr, he used to be head of the principal design group for the Soviet space programme during the 1980s. He designed the Meer(kat) Space Station, and now works with Orlov and 'Compare the Meerkat'. Sergei is first seen in the ad \"Sergei\", and later guests in \"Jacuzzi\", \"Art Class\" and all three of the 'Orlov Family Trilogy' advertisements. Sergei had been frequently mentioned on Orlov's Twitter and Facebook accounts, one time was prior to being included in an advert, and Aleksandr even started a petition to add the word 'Simples' to the dictionary because Sergei didn't approve of the word in a game of Scrabble.  Sergei has also starred in his own adverts without Orlov. [PAR] The 2011 campaign focused on a fictional Russian village named Meerkovo. The adverts featured new characters complaining about the danger caused to the town by confusion over Comparethemeerkat.com and Comparethemarket.com. The new characters were Maiya, Yakov, Vassily and Bogdan. A companion website was set",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Henry Ford - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.comHenry Ford - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com [PAR] Google [PAR] Henry Ford: Early Life & Engineering Career [PAR] Born in 1863, Henry Ford was the first surviving son of William and Mary Ford, who owned a prosperous farm in Dearborn, Michigan . At 16, he left home for the nearby city of Detroit, where he found apprentice work as a machinist. He returned to Dearborn and work on the family farm after three years, but continued to operate and service steam engines and work occasional stints in Detroit factories. In 1888, he married Clara Bryant, who had grown up on a nearby farm. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] The mass production techniques Henry Ford championed eventually allowed Ford Motor Company to turn out one Model T every 24 seconds. [PAR] In the first several years of their marriage, Ford supported himself and his new wife by running a sawmill. In 1891, he returned with Clara to Detroit, where he was hired as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company. Rising quickly through the ranks, he was promoted to chief engineer two years later. Around the same time, Clara gave birth to the couple\u2019s only son, Edsel Bryant Ford. On call 24 hours a day for his job at Edison, Ford spent his irregular hours on his efforts to build a gasoline-powered horseless carriage, or automobile. In 1896, he completed what he called the \u201cQuadricycle,\u201d which consisted of a light metal frame fitted with four bicycle wheels and powered by a two-cylinder, four-horsepower gasoline engine. [PAR] Henry Ford: Birth of Ford Motor Company and the Model T [PAR] Determined to improve upon his prototype, Ford sold the Quadricycle in order to continue building other vehicles. He received backing from various investors over the next seven years, some of whom formed the Detroit Automobile Company (later the Henry Ford Company) in 1899. His partners, eager to put a passenger car on the market, grew frustrated with Ford\u2019s constant need to improve, and Ford left his namesake company in 1902. (After his departure, it was reorganized as the Cadillac Motor Car Company.) The following year, Ford established the Ford Motor Company. [PAR] A month after the Ford Motor Company was established, the first Ford car\u2014the two-cylinder, eight-horsepower Model A\u2014was assembled at a plant on Mack Avenue in Detroit. At the time, only a few cars were assembled per day, and groups of two or three workers built them by hand from parts that were ordered from other companies. Ford was dedicated to the production of an efficient and reliable automobile that would be affordable for everyone; the result was the Model T , which made its debut in October 1908. [PAR] Henry Ford: Production & Labor Innovations [PAR] The \u201cTin Lizzie,\u201d as the Model T was known, was an immediate success, and Ford soon had more orders than the company could satisfy. As a result, he put into practice techniques of mass production that would revolutionize American industry, including the use of large production plants; standardized, interchangeable parts; and the moving assembly line. Mass production significantly cut down on the time required to produce an automobile, which allowed costs to stay low. In 1914, Ford also increased the daily wage for an eight-hour day for his workers to $5 (up from $2.34 for nine hours), setting a standard for the industry. [PAR] Even as production went up, demand for the Tin Lizzie remained high, and by 1918, half of all cars in America were Model Ts. In 1919, Ford named his son Edsel as president of Ford Motor Company, but he retained full control of the company\u2019s operations. After a court battle with his stockholders, led by brothers Horace and John Dodge, Henry Ford bought out all minority stockholders by 1920. In 1927, Ford moved production to a massive industrial complex he had built along the banks of the River Rouge in Dearborn, Michigan. The plant included a glass factory, steel mill, assembly line and all other necessary components of automotive production. That same year, Ford ceased",

The name evokes disdain or contempt among many readers who are otherwise ardent fans of Enid Blyton. What did this ragtag band of four boys, three girls and one dog do to arouse such revulsion? [PAR] Okay, maybe I exaggerated. But for most of us the Secret Seven happens to be the least revered series in Blyton's canon. Is this because the books were written for a younger set of readers? Could it be the smaller format? The perpetual scowl on the face of their highhanded leader, perhaps? [PAR] I expect all these factors do contribute to the\u2014undeserved, if you ask me\u2014negative reputation the Secret Seven has among many Blyton fans. [PAR] And is it mere coincidence that the letters 'SS' have historical connotations that are not exactly pleasant? The series was written between 1948 and 1963, so such an 'inspiration' is not entirely far-fetched. But I think it unlikely\u2014Blyton doesn't seem the sort who would take a sly dig at her own characters, even as a joke. [PAR] So, is the series really as juvenile as it's made out to be? Do the Seven have any redeeming qualities? Let's find out. [PAR] Cast of Characters [PAR] Peter: The head of the Secret Seven, Peter's word is Absolute Law. He usually decides the passwords, and seldom forgets them, unlike the others. Indeed, the easiest way to irk him is to forget the password or the SS badge (which others do with predictable regularity). Though he often acts like a dictator, he is annoyingly proved right on most occasions. The secret meetings are held in a shed at the bottom of the garden, some distance from his house. [PAR] Janet: Peter's sister. Co-owner of the shed and Scamper the golden spaniel, but that ends her stake in the Secret Seven. She comes across as a little brighter than the other two girls in the club (in one instance she sensibly makes a drawing of some tyre prints when the other girls only titter), but that's probably because she's constantly under Peter's thumb and doesn't dare to giggle quite so frequently. Her urge to dance in the moonlight comes in useful while trapping horse stealers on one occasion. [PAR] Jack: Jack is one of the more colourful characters. He's apparently second-in-command (though this is mentioned only once or twice in the books). He's also disappointingly gullible sometimes. In Secret Seven on the Trail, he believes the tall tales his sister Susie and her friends make up. He also forgets the Secret Seven password with exasperating regularity; indeed, Susie seems to remember it better than he does! To his credit, he is as brave and loyal as a right-hand man can be. [PAR] Pam: One of the two gigglers in the club. Perhaps her sole contribution to the club is when she \"interviews\" her grandmother in Three Cheers Secret Seven (and misspells the word \"absolutely\" in the process). She's a great friend of Barbara, for obvious reasons. Either of them is sportingly ready for a good cry when Peter starts shouting\u2014at them or one of the others, it doesn't matter. [PAR] Barbara: Giggles, squeals and shrieks come naturally to Barbara, as they do to Pam. Indeed, you can't easily tell one from the other. Perhaps that's why Derek Lucas' illustrations show Pam in pigtails, while Barbara leaves her hair free. I used to consider her very pretty in those illustrations when I was ten years old. Ah, the follies of youth. [PAR] Colin: Though he can be easily confused with George, Colin makes some interesting discoveries. For instance, he was the one who spots the escaping thief in Secret Seven Adventure, and the one who forgets the book about ships in the cubby-hole up a tree in Well Done Secret Seven. Oh, and it was at his granny's",

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village. Sixty nations boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while the Soviets and",

This oval cabochon shows the agate-like banding in various shades of green that is typical of malachite. The puffed heart shows concentric structures. [PAR] What is Malachite? [PAR] Malachite is a green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with a chemical composition of Cu2(CO3)(OH)2.  It was one of the first ores used to produce copper metal.  It is of minor importance today as an ore of copper because it is usually found in small quantities and can be sold for higher prices for other types of use. [PAR] Malachite has been used as a gemstone and sculptural material for thousands of years and is still popular today.  Today it is most often cut into cabochons or beads for jewelry use. [PAR] Malachite has a green color that does not fade over time or when exposed to light.  Those properties, along with its ability to be easily ground to a powder, made malachite a preferred pigment and coloring agent for thousands of years.

Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Where Does Malachite Form? [PAR] Malachite is a mineral that forms at shallow depths within the Earth, in the oxidizing zone above copper deposits. It precipitates from descending solutions in fractures, caverns, cavities, and the intergranular spaces of porous rock. It often forms within limestone where a subsurface chemical environment favorable for the formation of carbonate minerals can occur.  Associated minerals include azurite , bornite , calcite , chalcopyrite , copper , cuprite , and a variety of iron oxides. [PAR] Some of the first malachite deposits to be exploited were located in Egypt and Israel.  Over 4000 years ago, they were mined and used to produce copper.  Material from these deposits was also used to produce gemstones, sculptures, and pigments.  Several large deposits in the Ural Mountains of Russia were aggressively mined, and they supplied abundant gem and sculptural material in the 1800s.  Very little is produced from these deposits today.  Much of the  malachite entering the lapidary market today is from deposits in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Smaller amounts are produced in Australia, France, and Arizona. [PAR] Stalactitic malachite: A specimen of stalactitic malachite from the Kasompi Mine, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Gemstones, small sculptures, pigment. [PAR] Physical Properties of Malachite [PAR] Malachite's most striking physical property is its green color.  All specimens of the mineral are green and range from a pastel green, to a bright green, to an extremely dark green that is almost black.  It is typically found as stalactites and botryoidal coatings on the surfaces of underground cavities - similar to the deposits of calcite found in caves.  When these materials are cut into slabs and pieces, the sawn surfaces often exhibit banding and eyes that are similar to agate . [PAR] Malachite is rarely found as a crystal, but when found, the crystals are usually acicular to tabular in shape.  The crystals are bright green in color, translucent, with a vitreous to adamantine luster.  Non-crystalline specimens are opaque, usually with a dull to earthy luster. [PAR] Malachite is a copper mineral, and that  gives malachite a high specific gravity that ranges from 3.6 to 4.0.  This property is so striking for a green mineral that malachite is easy to identify.

[PAR] Al Capone was a notorious gangster who ran an organized crime syndicate in Chicago during the 1920s, taking advantage of the era of Prohibition . Capone, who was both charming and charitable as well as powerful and vicious, became an iconic figure of the successful American gangster. [PAR] Dates: January 17, 1899 -- January 25, 1947 [PAR] Also Known As: Alphonse Capone, Scarface [PAR] Al Capone's Childhood [PAR] Al Capone was the fourth of nine children born to Gabriele and Teresina (Teresa) Capone. Although Capone's parents had emigrated from Italy, Al Capone grew up in Brooklyn, New York . [PAR] From all known accounts, Capone's childhood was a normal one. His father was a barber and his mother stayed home with the children. They were a tight-knit Italian family who were trying to succeed in their new country. [PAR] Like many immigrant families at the time, the Capone children often dropped out of school early to help earn money for the family. Al Capone stayed in school until he was 14 and then left to take a number of odd jobs. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] The St. Valentine's Day Massacre [PAR] Around the same time, Capone joined a street gang called the South Brooklyn Rippers and then later the Five Points Juniors. These were groups of teenagers who roamed the streets, protected their turf from rival gangs, and sometimes carried out petty crimes like stealing cigarettes. [PAR] Scarface [PAR] It was through the Five Points gang that Al Capone came to the attention of brutal New York mobster Frankie Yale. In 1917, 18-year-old Al Capone went to work for Yale at the Harvard Inn as a bartender and as a waiter and bouncer when needed. Capone watched and learned as Yale used violence to maintain control over his empire. [PAR] One day while working at the Harvard Inn, Capone saw a man and woman sitting at a table. After his initial advances were ignored, Capone went up to the good-looking woman and whispered in her ear, \"Honey, you have a nice ass and I mean that as a compliment.\" The man with her was her brother, Frank Gallucio. [PAR] Defending his sister's honor, Gallucio punched Capone. However, Capone didn't let it end there; he decided to fight back. Gallucio then took out a knife and slashed at Capone's face, managing to cut Capone's left cheek three times (one of which cut Capone from ear to mouth). The scars left from this attack led to Capone's nickname of \"Scarface,\" a name he personally hated. [PAR] Family Life [PAR] Not long after this attack, Al Capone met Mary (\"Mae\") Coughlin, who was pretty, blonde, middle-class, and came from a respectable Irish family. A few months after they started dating, Mae became pregnant. Al Capone and Mae got married on December 30, 1918, three weeks after their son (Albert Francis Capone, a.k.a. \"Sonny\") was born. Sonny was to remain Capone's only child. [PAR] Throughout the rest of his life, Al Capone kept his family and his business interests completely separate. Capone was a doting father and husband, taking great care in keeping his family safe, cared for, and out of the spotlight. [PAR] However, despite his love for his family, Capone did have a number of mistresses over the years. Plus, unknown to him at the time, Capone contracted syphilis from a prostitute before he met Mae. Since the symptoms of syphilis can disappear quickly, Capone had no idea that he still had the sexually transmitted disease or that it would so greatly affect his health in later years. [PAR] Capone Moves to Chicago [PAR] About 1920, Capone left the East Coast and headed to Chicago. He was looking for a fresh start working for Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio. Unlike Yale who used violence to run his racket, Torrio was a sophisticated gentleman who preferred cooperation and negotiation to rule his crime organization. Capone",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Ten Facts About Fantasia (1940)Ten Facts About Fantasia (1940) [PAR] Previous Facts - Next Facts [PAR] Ten Facts About Walt Disney's Fantasia [PAR] Here are ten facts about Walt Disney's animated  masterpiece from 1940, featuring a compilation of animations accompanied by a soundtrack  of classical music. [PAR] Fact One [PAR] Fantasia was Walt Disney's third feature film, following on from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940) [PAR] Fact Two [PAR] The Sorcerer's Apprentice, perhaps the most famous short of the film Fantasia, starred Mickey Mouse as the, er, Sorcerer's Apprentice. This role was intended as a come-back role for Disney's famous mouse, who was losing out in popularity to Donald Duck. However, also considered for the role of the apprentice was Dopey from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The animation itself was also originally going to be a one-off cartoon, but since it was more expensive to produce than regular Disney cartoons and was unlikely to make any profit, Disney decided to make it part of a collection of animated sequences with classical music accompaniments which could then be released as a feature film. That collection of animated shorts would become Fantasia. [PAR] Fact Three [PAR] The conductor of the music used in Fantasia was Leopold Stokowski. When The Sorcerer's Apprentice was being worked on, Stokowski offered to conduct the orchestra for free. He probably changed his mind when he found out he would be conducting the orchestra for the entire film. [PAR] Fact Four [PAR] Live action sequences shown between the animated segments show an orchestra playing the soundtrack. In those scenes, the orchestra were miming! The music for all sequences apart from The Sorceror's Apprentice was played by Philadelphia Orchestra. In the film, members of the orchestra pretending to play to the pre-recorded music were local musicians and employees of the film studio. [PAR] Fact Five [PAR] The original release of Fantasia featured an intermission which was announced by the film's host, Deems Taylor. The members of the orchestra are seen leaving their seats while the curtains close, both on the film and in the movie theatre showing it. After the intermission, which would have lasted for fifteen minutes, the curtains in the theatre and on the film open and the orchestra are seen to return to their seats, and then have a bit of a jam session.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Six [PAR] Fantasia, which was essentially a way for Walt Disney to show off animation and sound techniques in films, was the first commercial film to have its soundtrack recorded in stereo. It was also planned that parts of it would be shown in widescreen and other parts to be in 3-D, and, to make the film a real treat for the senses, for perfumes to be sprayed into the theatre during the Nutcracker Suite sequence.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Seven [PAR] Nowadays, films are completed weeks, months or even years before they get their premiere. Fantasia however was completed four hours before premiering in New York City on November 13th 1940. The final scene to be produced was flown to New York on the day of the premiere and edited into the film in time for its first showing. [PAR] Fact Eight [PAR] Despite getting generally good reviews, Fantasia was only shown in twelve movie theatres on its first release due to Disney's distribution company RKO initially deciding not to distribute it. The meant that the film could not make a profit, and meant that the budget for Disney's next film, Dumbo, was quite low. The film got a national release a couple of years later, although heavily edited (from the original 125 runtime to 81 minutes) and in mono. Again it was a commercial failure. A release in 1956 restored the stereo soundtrack, although it was only on its release in 1969 that the film finally made a profit, due to its psychedelic nature being popular with the teenage and college student audiences of the time. Its soundtrack was completely rerecorded for a 1982 release. Even the host's introductions to each segment were dubbed over. A 1990 release used the original soundtrack which had been digitally remastered, and a release for 2000 saw several of the original",

    "orig_answer": "orange",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ColorColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, blue, yellow, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates. [PAR] Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance. [PAR] The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light). [PAR] Physics of color  [PAR] Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\". [PAR] Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called metamers of the color in question. [PAR] Spectral colors  [PAR] The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum \u2013 named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671 \u2013 include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see refractive index). [PAR] The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list \u2013 the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to perceive colors in the same way ). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today we call cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported at the time.  [PAR] The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive-green. [PAR] Color of objects  [PAR] The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contribute to the color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the",

Although it took the ship over two and a half hours to sink, the vast majority of the crew and passengers perished due to a significant lack of lifeboats and improper use of those that did exist.

Ballard had grown up in San Diego, California, near the ocean, where he began his life-long fascination with the ocean and learned to scuba dive. After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965 with degrees in both chemistry and geology, Ballard signed up for the Army. Two years later, in 1967, Ballard transferred to the Navy, where he was assigned to the Deep Submergence Group at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Research Institution in Massachusetts, thus beginning his illustrious career with submersibles. [PAR] By 1974, Ballard had received two doctoral degrees (marine geology and geophysics) from the University of Rhode Island and had spent a lot of time conducting deep water dives in a manned submersible he helped design, called Alvin.

His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring . At the time of his death, Sm\u00e9agol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a Hobbit , but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains in the book The Hobbit. In the movies, he was a deuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.

Around the year TA 2463 , Sm\u00e9agol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron , Isildur , and D\u00e9agol . D\u00e9agol was his cousin, and on Sm\u00e9agol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that D\u00e9agol found a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sm\u00e9agol fell to the power of the ring and demanded it as a birthday present. When De\u00e1gol refused, Sm\u00e9agol promptly flew into a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him to death and taking the ring as his own. Sm\u00e9agol was quickly corrupted further by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470 . The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] NATO phonetic alphabetThe International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet and also known as the ICAO radiotelephonic, phonetic or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet. Although often called \"phonetic alphabets\", spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel. [PAR] The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot,  Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu. [PAR] International adoption [PAR] After the phonetic alphabet was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  (see history below) it was adopted by many other international and national organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). [PAR] It is a subset of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which originally included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound signals by whistle, siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases.  The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...).  In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages. [PAR] NATO [PAR] A common name for this spelling alphabet, \"NATO phonetic alphabet,\" exists because it appears in Allied Tactical Publication ATP-1, Volume II: Allied Maritime Signal and Maneuvering Book used by all allied navies of NATO, which adopted a modified form of the International Code of Signals. Because the latter allows messages to be spelled via flags or Morse code, it naturally named the code words used to spell out messages by voice its \"phonetic alphabet\". The name NATO phonetic alphabet became widespread because the signals used to facilitate the naval communications and tactics of NATO have become global.  [PAR] However, ATP-1 is marked NATO Confidential (or the lower NATO Restricted) so it is not available publicly. Nevertheless, a NATO unclassified version of the document is provided to foreign, even hostile, militaries, even though they are not allowed to make it available publicly. The spelling alphabet is now also defined in other unclassified international military documents.  [PAR] The NATO alphabet appeared in some United States Air Force Europe publications during the Cold War. A particular example was the Ramstein Air Base, Telephone Directory published between 1969 and 1973 (currently out of print). The American and NATO versions had differences and the translation was provided as a convenience. Differences included Alfa, Bravo and Able, Baker for the first two letters. [PAR] History [PAR] The ICAO developed this system in the 1950s in order to account for discrepancies that might arise in communications as a result of multiple alphabet naming systems coexisting in different places and organizations.  [PAR] In the official   version of the alphabet, the non-English spellings Alfa and Juliett are used. Alfa is spelled with an f as it is in most European languages because the English and French spelling alpha would not be pronounced properly by native speakers of some other languages \u2013 who may not know that ph should be pronounced as f.\u00a0 Juliett is spelled with a tt",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Shipping ForecastThe Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the British Isles.  It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day. The broadcast finishes at approximately 0058. [PAR] * 0520 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from coastal stations at 0525, and an inshore waters forecast at 0527. [PAR] * 1201 \u2013 normally transmitted on LW only. [PAR] * 1754 \u2013 transmitted only on LW on weekdays, as an opt-out from the PM programme, but at weekends transmitted on both FM and LW. [PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.  [PAR] Region names [PAR] The 31 sea areas covering the waters around the British Isles are as defined by the map shown here: [PAR] * Viking [PAR] * North Utsire [PAR] * South Utsire [PAR] * Forties [PAR] * Cromarty [PAR] * Forth [PAR] * Tyne [PAR] * Dogger [PAR] * Fisher [PAR] * German Bight [PAR] * Humber [PAR] * Thames [PAR] * Dover [PAR] * Wight [PAR] * Portland [PAR] * Plymouth [PAR] * Biscay [PAR] * Trafalgar [PAR] * FitzRoy [PAR] * Sole [PAR] * Lundy [PAR] * Fastnet [PAR] * Irish Sea [PAR] * Shannon [PAR] * Rockall [PAR] * Malin [PAR] * Hebrides [PAR] * Bailey [PAR] * Fair Isle [PAR] * Faeroes [PAR] * Southeast Iceland [PAR] The areas were already roughly as listed above by 1949. Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

Attempted to shake-off his \"Red Ed\" tag by talking about the \"squeezed middle\" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. [PAR] He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on \"refounding\" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. [PAR] The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. [PAR] ED BALLS - SHADOW CHANCELLOR [PAR] As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44 , became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. [PAR] YVETTE COOPER - SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITIES [PAR] Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. [PAR] DOUGLAS ALEXANDER - SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY [PAR] The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43 , he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign.

Known as the First Battle of Bull Run (or Manassas), the engagement began when about 35,000 Union troops marched from the federal capital in Washington, D.C. to strike a Confederate force of 20,000 along a small river known as Bull Run. After fighting on the defensive for most of the day, the rebels rallied and were able to break the Union right flank, sending the Federals into a chaotic retreat towards Washington. The Confederate victory gave the South a surge of confidence and shocked many in the North, who realized the war would not be won as easily as they had hoped. [PAR] Google [PAR] Prelude to the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) [PAR] By July 1861, two months after Confederate troops opened fire on Fort Sumter to begin the Civil War, the northern press and public were eager for the Union Army to make an advance on Richmond ahead of the planned meeting of the Confederate Congress there on July 20. Encouraged by early victories by Union troops in western Virginia , and by the war fever spreading through the North, President Abraham Lincoln ordered Brigadier General Irvin McDowell to mount an offensive that would hit quickly and decisively at the enemy and open the way to Richmond, thus bringing the war to a mercifully quick end. The offensive would begin with an attack on more than 20,000 Confederate troops under the command of General P.G.T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction, Virginia (25 miles from Washington , D.C.) along a little river known as Bull Run. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] After First Manassas, Stonewall Jackson further distinguished himself in the Shenandoah Valley, Second Manassas and Fredericksburg. The man Lee called his \"right arm\" was accidentally shot by his own men at Chancellorsville and died of complications relating to the injury. [PAR] The cautious McDowell, then in command of the 35,000 Union volunteer troops gathered in the Federal capital, knew that his men were ill prepared and pushed for a postponement of the advance to give him time for additional training. But Lincoln ordered him to begin the offensive nonetheless, reasoning (correctly) that the rebel army was made up of similarly amateur soldiers. McDowell\u2019s army began moving out of Washington on July 16; its slow movement allowed Beauregard (who also received advance notice of his enemy\u2019s movements through a Confederate espionage network in Washington) to call on his fellow Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for reinforcements. Johnston, in command of some 11,000 rebels in the Shenandoah Valley, was able to outmaneuver a Union force in the region and march his men towards Manassas. [PAR] Battle Begins at Bull Run [PAR] McDowell\u2019s Union force struck on July 21, shelling the enemy across Bull Run while more troops crossed the river at Sudley Ford in an attempt to hit the Confederate left flank. Over two hours, 10,000 Federals gradually pushed back 4,500 rebels across the Warrington turnpike and up Henry House Hill. Reporters, congressmen and other onlookers who had traveled from Washington and were watching the battle from the nearby countryside prematurely celebrated a Union victory, but reinforcements from both Johnston and Beauregard\u2019s armies soon arrived on the battlefield to rally the Confederate troops. In the afternoon, both sides traded attacks and counterattacks near Henry House Hill. On Johnston and Beauregard\u2019s orders, more and more Confederate reinforcements arrived, even as the Federals struggled with coordinating assaults made by different regiments. [PAR] The \u201cRebel Yell\u201d at Bull Run (Manassas) [PAR] By four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, both sides had an equal number of men on the field of battle (about 18,000 on each side were engaged at Bull Run), and Beauregard ordered a counterattack along the entire line. Screaming as they advanced (the \u201crebel yell\u201d that would become infamous among Union troops) the Confederates managed to break the Union line.

[PAR] Ascending to the throne at only 18\u00a0years old, Queen Victoria ruled the United Kingdom for nearly 64 years -- the longest of any British monarch. During her reign, Great Britain became a powerful industrial nation and boasted an empire that stretched across the globe. [PAR] Despite the early loss of her beloved husband, Queen Victoria provided a reassuring stability during much of the 19th century - an era of great social and technological change.

[PAR] Christened Alexandrina Victoria at birth, the child came to be called Victoria. Despite being born into royalty, she did not grow up surrounded by wealth. Edward's spendthrift ways had left him with many debts. [PAR] The duke and duchess, in an attempt to reduce expenses, moved with their infant daughter to a modest home. Not long after the move, Edward became ill and died of pneumonia on January 23, 1820 (Victoria was just eight months old). Six days later, King George III died as well, thus making George IV King of England. [PAR] Victoria was now third in line to the throne behind her two uncles, who had failed to produce heirs. [PAR] Victoria's Less Than Royal Childhood [PAR] King George IV , whose only legitimate child had died in childbirth, was resentful of his brother's daughter. He begrudgingly allowed Victoria and her mother to move into an apartment at Kensington Palace, but would only approve a small allowance. The duchess\u2019s brother, Prince Leopold (later King Leopold I\u00a0of Belgium ), agreed to pay for Victoria's upbringing and education.

In this way, Conroy - through the duchess - could essentially control the throne. [PAR] When King George IV (who loathed Conroy and the duchess) died in 1830, the pair believed they could easily persuade newly-crowned King William IV to name the duchess as Victoria's regent.

[PAR] For administrative purposes, England outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly is divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. These counties may consist of a single district or be divided into several districts. As of April 2009, 27 of these counties are divided into districts and have a county council. Six of the counties, covering the major conurbations, are known as metropolitan counties, which do not have county councils, although some functions are organised on a county-wide basis by their districts (metropolitan boroughs) acting jointly. [PAR] All of England (including Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) is also divided into 48 ceremonial counties, which are also known as geographic counties. Most ceremonial counties correspond to a metropolitan or non-metropolitan county of the same name but often with reduced boundaries. [PAR] The current arrangement is the result of incremental reform. Many of the counties have their origins in the Middle Ages, although the larger counties of Yorkshire and Sussex lost many or all of their administrative functions centuries ago. The geographic counties which existed before the local government reforms of 1965 and 1974 are referred to as ancient counties or historic counties. From 1889 to 1974 areas with county councils were known as administrative counties, which excluded larger towns and cities known as county boroughs and included divisions of some geographic counties. From 1974 to 1996 the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, some of which were established only in 1974, corresponded directly with the ceremonial counties. [PAR] Counties, usually either historic counties or current ceremonial counties, are used as the geographical basis for a number of institutions such as police and fire services, sports clubs and other non-government organisations. [PAR] For the purpose of sorting and delivering mail, England was divided into 48 postal counties until 1996; these have been abandoned by Royal Mail in favour of postcodes. [PAR] Scope and structure [PAR] Local government [PAR] Cumbria, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Warwickshire, West Sussex and Worcestershire are non-metropolitan counties of multiple districts with a county council. In these counties most services are provided by the county council and the district councils have a more limited role. Their areas each correspond exactly to ceremonial counties. [PAR] There are six metropolitan counties which are based on the major English conurbations; and they also correspond exactly to a ceremonial county and have multiple districts, but do not have county councils. They are Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. [PAR] In these counties the district councils provide the majority of services. Similarly, Berkshire is a non-metropolitan county with no county council and multiple districts and maps directly to a ceremonial county. Bristol, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Northumberland and Rutland are ceremonial counties consisting of a non-metropolitan county of a single district, and are known as unitary authorities. [PAR] Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, East Sussex, Essex, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Somerset and Staffordshire are non-metropolitan counties with multiple districts and a county council, where one or more districts have been split off to form unitary authorities. The effect is that the corresponding ceremonial county is larger than the non-metropolitan county of the same name and the county council is responsible for providing services in only part of the county. In Cornwall, Durham, East Riding of Yorkshire, Shropshire and Wiltshire the bulk of the area is a unitary authority which shares the name of the ceremonial county and the rest of county is part of one or more other unitary authorities.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] SparkNotes: The Cherry Orchard: ContextSparkNotes: The Cherry Orchard: Context [PAR] The Cherry Orchard [PAR] Table of Contents [PAR] Plot Overview [PAR] Anton Pavlevich Chekhov was born on January 17th, 1860, in Taganrog, Russia. His father Pavel was a shopkeeper the town, which was small, provincial, and on the Sea of Azov in the south of Russia, and his grandfather was Egor Chekhov, a serf. Serfs were the legal property of the landowners who owned the property on which they resided; it was thus a form of slavery. In 1841, Egor bought freedom for himself and his family at the price of 875 rubles. [PAR] Russia had been changing ever since the early 18th century, when Tsar Peter the Great carried out a series of reforms with the intent of modernizing Russia in Western Europe's image. European styles in fashion and art were imported, the Western canon was widely read among the nobility, and French was adopted as the language of cultured discourse. A large government bureaucracy was created; the achievement of rank became an obsession of Russian life. During Chekhov's childhood, in the time of Tsar Alexander II, a second wave of reforms was underway, reforms that further liberalized the country and its economy. The most important of these was the Emancipation Declaration of 1861, which freed the serfs from bondage. These reforms caused great controversy, as they introduced what was, in effect, the beginning of a free-market economy, undermining the power of the nobility, and sometimes even impoverishing them. The situation displayed in The Cherry Orchard, of a wealthy landowning family forced to sell their estate in order to pay their debts, was thus a familiar one in the Russian society of Chekhov's day. [PAR] Chekhov himself had a relatively quiet childhood. He attended the local Russian grammar school, worked in his father's store and occasionally wrote small pieces for the amusement of his family. Taganrog was not a typical provincial town; it was a multicultural port, with Italians, Greeks, and Turks residing in the wealthier sections of town and Russians such as the Chekhovs living in comparatively poor suburbs. It had a theater, which the young Chekhov would often visit. When Chekhov was sixteen, Pavel's store failed, and the entire family had to move to Moscow\u2014the entire family, that is, except for Anton. A merchant (and friend of the family) had helped the Chekhovs with a loan, but insisted on keeping Anton with him in the house as a kind of collateral. As soon as he could, he left Taganrog in order to pursue medical studies in Moscow in 1879 at the age of 19. [PAR] That year, Chekhov began to write comic stories in order to pay his medical school tuition. By the time he was twenty, he was employed by The Spectator magazine as their regular humorist. Over ninety percent of Chekhov's published work appeared in magazines before he was twenty-eight, and, by this age, he had already established himself as a premier writer of short stories. As he developed as a writer, his stories began to take on deeper and more profound themes, as he moved away from his comic roots. [PAR] To this day, Chekhov's literary reputation primarily rests with his short stories, and Chekhov's early plays, written primarily in his early 20s, are not well-remembered. It was only in 1896 that he began to turn his attention back to drama; in the eight remaining years before his death, he managed to complete four plays: The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, The Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard. [PAR] The first performance of The Seagull was nearly laughed off the stage; it was criticized as dull, unimaginative, and lacking any sort of dramatic tension (a critical undercurrent that has survived in Russia to this day). Only gradually did Chekhov's new form of drama, emphasizing characterization, detail and symbolism instead of plot development and incident, gain acceptance. Chekhov was the in-house playwright for the Moscow Arts Theatre, which had been founded by his friend Vladimir Nemirovich-Davchenko. During this time, he fell in love with one of the",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical noteIn music, the term note has three primary meanings: [PAR] #A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound (\u266a, \u266b); [PAR] #A pitched sound itself. [PAR] #A pitch class. [PAR] Notes are the \"atoms\" of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.  [PAR] The term note can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\".  In the former case, one uses note to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: Key signature names and translations.) [PAR] Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class. [PAR] In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si, including for instance Italy, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details).  [PAR] The eighth note, or octave, is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of scientific pitch notation combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440\u00a0Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4. [PAR] There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the Helmholtz pitch notation and the scientific pitch notation. [PAR] Accidentals  [PAR] Letter names are modified by the accidentals. A sharp  raises a note by a semitone or half-step, and a flat  lowers it by the same amount. In modern tuning a half step has a frequency ratio of \\sqrt[12]{2}, approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F represents F-sharp, B is B-flat. [PAR] Additional accidentals are the double-sharp , raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat , lowering it by that amount. [PAR] In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the key signature, which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the natural symbol , is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G-sharp, a local flat before a G makes it G-flat (not G natural), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat () to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp  sign on a key signature with a single sharp  indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp. [PAR] Assuming enharmonicity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B is equal to the note C. Assuming",

    "orig_answer": "nicholas parsons",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak.

The first perspective suggests that Hamlet achieves a sense of peace as the \"noise\" in his head subsides after he resolves his life to fate.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Shipping ForecastThe Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the British Isles.  It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day. The broadcast finishes at approximately 0058. [PAR] * 0520 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from coastal stations at 0525, and an inshore waters forecast at 0527. [PAR] * 1201 \u2013 normally transmitted on LW only. [PAR] * 1754 \u2013 transmitted only on LW on weekdays, as an opt-out from the PM programme, but at weekends transmitted on both FM and LW. [PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.  [PAR] Region names [PAR] The 31 sea areas covering the waters around the British Isles are as defined by the map shown here: [PAR] * Viking [PAR] * North Utsire [PAR] * South Utsire [PAR] * Forties [PAR] * Cromarty [PAR] * Forth [PAR] * Tyne [PAR] * Dogger [PAR] * Fisher [PAR] * German Bight [PAR] * Humber [PAR] * Thames [PAR] * Dover [PAR] * Wight [PAR] * Portland [PAR] * Plymouth [PAR] * Biscay [PAR] * Trafalgar [PAR] * FitzRoy [PAR] * Sole [PAR] * Lundy [PAR] * Fastnet [PAR] * Irish Sea [PAR] * Shannon [PAR] * Rockall [PAR] * Malin [PAR] * Hebrides [PAR] * Bailey [PAR] * Fair Isle [PAR] * Faeroes [PAR] * Southeast Iceland [PAR] The areas were already roughly as listed above by 1949. Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

The question asks to identify the shipping area that is due north of Trafalgar.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the relevant information from the context.\nThe context lists the 31 sea areas around the British Isles in a specific order: Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger, Fisher, German Bight, Humber, Thames, Dover, Wight, Portland, Plymouth, Biscay, Trafalgar, FitzRoy, Sole, Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea, Shannon, Rockall, Malin, Hebrides, Bailey, Fair Isle, Faeroes, Southeast Iceland. It mentions that the areas are named in a roughly clockwise direction.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the geographical order and relation of the sea areas.\nTo find the area due north of Trafalgar, we need to understand the geographical layout and the order of the sea areas. The list provided in the context gives the sea areas in a clockwise order.\n\n## Step 4: Locate Trafalgar and the area north of it.\nTrafalgar is listed among the sea areas. By examining the list, we see that the order around Trafalgar is: ... Plymouth, Biscay, Trafalgar, FitzRoy ... This indicates that FitzRoy is the area immediately following Trafalgar in the list.\n\n## Step 5: Assess if FitzRoy is north of Trafalgar based on the clockwise order.\nSince the areas are listed in a roughly clockwise direction, and Trafalgar is followed by FitzRoy, it implies that FitzRoy is to the north or in the general direction following Trafalgar in this clockwise sequence.\n\n## Step 6: Rephrase the question and answer according to the guidelines.\nThe original question is \"Which shipping area is due north of Trafalgar?\" and the answer is \"FitzRoy\". To rephrase, we need to create a question that is semantically equivalent but potentially more detailed or clear.\n\n## Step 7: Generate the rewritten question and answer pair.\nGiven the context and the need to identify the area north of Trafalgar, a rewritten question could be: \"When considering the sea areas around the British Isles in a clockwise direction, which area directly follows Trafalgar and is thereby generally to its north?\"\n\n## Step 8: Prepare the answer options.\nThe correct answer is FitzRoy. We need to generate other plausible but incorrect options to complete the multiple-choice question.\n\n## Step 9: Create plausible incorrect answer options.\nOther sea areas that could be considered as potentially being near Trafalgar or in a similar geographical context are Plymouth (to the north but before Trafalgar in the clockwise direction is not correct, it's actually before Trafalgar and more to the north but on the other side of Trafalgar in the list), Biscay (before Trafalgar), and Sole or Lundy (near but not directly north). However, the correct relative positioning requires understanding that FitzRoy directly follows Trafalgar.\n\n## Step 10: Finalize the question and answer options.\nLet's create a multiple-choice question with the correct answer and plausible distractors.\n\n## Step 11: Document the analysis and generate the output.\nWithin `<document_analysis>`, the thought process involves understanding the geographical layout and the order of sea areas as listed.

Geographically located in the western part of the United States, California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, and Arizona to the southeast. California shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south and the Pacific Ocean is on the state's western coastline. The state capital is Sacramento, which is located in the northern part of the state. [PAR] What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican\u2013American War. The western portion of Alta California was organized as the State of California, which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale immigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom. [PAR] California's diverse geography ranges from the Sierra Nevada in the east to the Pacific Coast in the west, from the redwood\u2013Douglas fir forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest point (Mount Whitney) and the lowest point (Death Valley) in the contiguous United States. Earthquakes are common because of the state's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, but most are too small to be felt.  Drought has also become a notable feature.  [PAR] California is regarded as a global trendsetter in both popular culture and politics, and is the birthplace of the film industry, the hippie counterculture, the Internet,  and the personal computer. The state's economy is centered on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific and technical business services; together comprising 58% of the state's economy.  Three of the world's largest 20 firms by revenue, Chevron, Apple, and McKesson, are headquartered in the state.  Although only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state.  If it were a country, California would be the 6th largest economy in the world and the 35th most populous. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word California originally referred to the entire region composed of the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico, the current U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming. [PAR] The name California is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by Black Amazons and ruled by Queen Calafia,   who fought alongside Muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a Muslim leader, the Caliph, fictionally implying that California was the Caliphate.  The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandi\u00e1n, written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo.Gudde, Erwin G. and William Bright. 2004.

Eternal. Sublime. Taj Mahal \u2013 a 17th-century mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra \u2013 is a gleaming symbol of love, devotion, and craftsmanship. Erected by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to cherish the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, it truly is \u201clove wrought in stones.\u201d Literally meaning \u201cCrown Palace\u201d, it is guarded by four slender marble minarets and emblazoned with verses taken from Quran. The eminence of sanctity oozes out from each marble pore. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of enduring love, built by the Emperor Shah Jahan to memorialize his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is a mausoleum made of white marble, in which the Emperor had his wife entombed, and after his own death, Emperor Shah Jahan was entombed next to his wife. [PAR] In the official history of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign, written by Abdul Hamid Lahori in his book Badshahnama, he mentions the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara, which means the illumined or famous tomb. [PAR] Designed in the Mughal Empire style with touches of Persian influence and delicate designs, there is an entire complex that surrounds the mausoleum. The main building was completed in 1648, however, the surrounding architectural forms took five years for completion. The complex includes gardens, fountains, and a reflecting pool, which reflects the image of the Taj Mahal. [PAR] The white-colored tomb rests on a square plinth and comprises of a symmetrical building with an arch-shaped doorway crowned by a large dome and finial. The original finial was constructed of gold, but it was replicated by a bronze model in the early 19th century. The top of the tomb is embellished with a lotus design, mixing the Persian and the Indian architectural styles. The recherch\u00e9 inlay work and elaborate craftsmanship together with the calligraphy leaves one utterly fascinated. For the interior inlay work, Shah Jahan preferred to use precious and semi-precious stones. [PAR] Four minarets, each more than 40 meters tall, recall the traditional component of the mosques. The minarets were constructed somewhat outside the plinth to avoid damage that may occur if any minaret falls. [PAR] Passages from the Quran can be seen bedecking the walls of the entire complex. These passages refer to the day of judgement. [PAR] Over the centuries, the monument of love has been experiencing neglect and is deteriorating. During the early 20th century, a major restoration of this wonder took place. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is now in danger due to excessive pollution. The restoration works undertaken by the government are slow. [PAR] After a tour of the Taj Mahal, visitors feel hungry. There are many eating joints near the Taj Mahal. Some of the food joints include the Silk Route Restaurant, Zorba The Buddha, Olive Garden, and Capri Restaurant.

[PAR] Released 4/14/2014 [PAR] Herpes Zoster in People Who Received Varicella Vaccine [PAR] Herpes zoster, also known as zoster and shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). [PAR] Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Once the illness resolves, the virus remains dormant (latent) in the dorsal root ganglia. VZV can reactive later in a person\u2019s life and cause a painful, maculopapular rash called herpes zoster. [PAR] Anyone who has had varicella or gotten varicella vaccine can develop herpes zoster. Most people typically have only one episode of herpes zoster in their lifetime. However, second and even third episodes are possible. [PAR] Clinical Features [PAR] People with herpes zoster most commonly have a rash in one or two adjacent dermatomes (localized zoster). The rash most commonly appears on the trunk along a thoracic dermatome. The rash does not usually cross the body\u2019s midline. However, approximately 20% of people have rash that overlaps adjacent dermatomes. Less commonly, the rash can be more widespread and affect three or more dermatomes. This condition is called disseminated zoster. This generally occurs only in people with compromised or suppressed immune systems. Disseminated zoster can be difficult to distinguish from varicella. [PAR] The rash is usually painful, itchy or tingly. These symptoms may precede rash onset by days to weeks. Some people may also have headache, photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), and malaise in the prodromal phase. [PAR] The rash develops into clusters of clear vesicles. New vesicles continue to form over three to five days and progressively dry and crust over. They usually heal in two to four weeks. There may be permanent pigmentation changes and scarring on the skin. [PAR] Complications [PAR] Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster. It is a persistent pain in the area where the rash once was. PHN is diagnosed in people who have pain that persists after their rash has resolved. Some define PHN as any duration of pain after the rash resolves; others define it as duration of pain for more than 30 days, or for more than 90 days after rash onset. PHN can last for weeks or months and occasionally, for many years. [PAR] A person's risk of having PHN after herpes zoster increases with age. Older adults are more likely to have PHN and to have longer lasting and more severe pain. Approximately 13% (and possibly more) of people 60 years of age and older with herpes zoster will get PHN. PHN is rare in people younger than 40 years old. Other predictors of PHN include the level of pain a person has when they have the rash and the size of their rash. [PAR] Other complications of herpes zoster include\u2014 [PAR] ophthalmic involvement with acute or chronic ocular sequelae (herpes zoster ophthalmicus); [PAR] bacterial superinfection of the lesions, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus and, less commonly, due to group A beta hemolytic streptococcus; [PAR] cranial and peripheral nerve palsies; and [PAR] visceral involvement, such as meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and acute retinal necrosis. [PAR] People with compromised or suppressed immune systems are more likely to have complications from herpes zoster. They are more likely to have severe rash that lasts longer. Also, they are at increased risk of developing disseminated herpes zoster. [PAR] \u00a0 Top of Page [PAR] Vaccination [PAR] The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends zoster vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) for people aged 60 years and older. Even people who have had herpes zoster should receive the vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. [PAR] Herpes zoster vaccine is approved by FDA for people aged 50 years and older. However, CDC does not recommend routine use of herpes zoster vaccine in people aged 50 through 59 years old. Health care providers considering the herpes zoster vaccine for certain persons aged 50 through 59 years should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their patients.",

[PAR] After this decision, the \"noise\" in his head subsides.\u00a0 He seems to think more clearly.\u00a0 The final quote--\"the rest is silence\"--could represent the true peace that Hamlet feels as both external and internal noise are gone. [PAR] like 2 dislike 0 [PAR] August 16, 2008 at 9:29 AM [PAR] Hamlet, who speaks the majority of the lines in the play, is about to die and stop speaking for ever. He has avenged his father's murder, been cut with the poisoned rapier, and, as he has just reflected to Horatio, is about to pass the crown of Denmark (he is, at this moment, effectively the only candidate to be king) to Fortinbras. There will be no familial succession. In that sense, the rest is silence for the line of the Hamlets. [PAR] Yet there is (as with so many other things in Hamlet) a meta-theatrical element. Hamlet has just asked Horatio not to commit suicide (Horatio's line 'Here's yet some liquor left' refers to a drop of poison left and his desire to kill himself) but to stay alive and to 'report' Hamlet's story to Fortinbras. [PAR] Hamlet cannot voice his choice for succession nor can he tell his own story: he is about to die; there can only be silence from him. But when the play--itself a version of Hamlet's story--comes to an end, part of Horatio's project, even after the curtain has come down, is to re-tell that same story: [PAR] So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, [PAR] Which have solicited. [PAR] Paraphrase: So tell Fortinbras, with the events and results that came to pass, more or less, which wrongdoing was provoked and incited. [PAR] So, perhaps, as we come to the end of a performance of Hamlet in the theatre, we confront Hamlet. Yet, in an odd sort of way, we simply come to the end of a cycle.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo address the task, I will begin by analyzing the given context, question, and answer.

The question asks for the Shakespearean character whose last words were \"The Rest is Silence.\" The answer provided is \"Hamlet.\"\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context discusses Hamlet's final words and their significance in the play. It highlights Hamlet's emotional state and the \"noise\" he experiences due to his circumstances. As Hamlet approaches death, he seems to have found peace, and his final words, \"the rest is silence,\" reflect this. The context also touches upon the meta-theatrical aspect of Hamlet's last words, relating to the end of his story and the continuation of it through Horatio's narration.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The analysis involves understanding Hamlet's character, his emotional journey, and the thematic elements Shakespeare might have intended to convey through Hamlet's final words. It also involves considering the play's structure and how Hamlet's death affects the narrative's progression.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The difficulty level of the question is rated as 2 out of 10 because it is relatively straightforward and doesn't require deep analysis of the context to answer. It's a factual question about the play.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: To enhance the question's complexity and encourage deeper understanding, it could be rephrased to explore the significance or implications of Hamlet's final words rather than just identifying the character who spoke them.\n\nGiven the original question and answer, I will rephrase and rewrite them to fit the guidelines provided, ensuring they are semantically equivalent but more challenging and insightful.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the name of the Shakespearean character who, as he succumbs to death after avenging his father's murder and ensuring the throne of Denmark passes to Fortinbras, utters the profound final words, \"The rest is silence\"?\nA: Macbeth\nB: Othello\nC: Hamlet\nD: King Lear\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is Hamlet because, according to the play, Hamlet is the character who says \"The rest is silence\" as his final words before dying.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ScrabbleScrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a gameboard which is divided into a 15\u00d715 grid of squares. The tiles must form words which, in crossword fashion, flow left to right in rows or downwards in columns. The words must be defined in a standard dictionary, or present in specified reference works (e.g., the Official Tournament and Club Word List, the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), which provide a list of officially permissible words. [PAR] The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the United States and Canada and has been sold by Hasbro's Parker Brothers division since 1999. Prior to 1999, it was sold as a Milton Bradley game. Outside the United States and Canada, Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel. The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a Scrabble set.   There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world. [PAR] Game details [PAR] The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15\u00d715 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. [PAR] In official club and tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack. [PAR] The board is marked with \"premium\" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red \"triple-word\" squares, 17 pink \"double-word\" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol; 12 dark blue \"triple-letter\" squares, and 24 light blue \"double-letter\" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL. Despite this, the original premium square color scheme is still the preferred scheme for Scrabble boards used in tournaments.  [PAR] In an English-language set, the game contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points of each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English writing; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values. [PAR] Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are 19 x square and 4 mm thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition varies the width up to 2 mm for different letters.  Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. 13 x); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner. [PAR] S is the most valuable letter in English-language Scrabble because it easily goes on the ends of words; Alfred Butts included only four instances to avoid a game that was \"too easy\". Q is considered the most problematic letter, as most words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German. J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end.  C and V may be troublesome in the endgame, since no two-letter words with them exist, save for CH in SOWPODS.

The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality:  of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for machine-made paper, while quires of 24 sheets are often used for handmade or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets. ) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, depending on the type of paper.  [PAR] Nomenclature [PAR] The current word \"quire\" derives from OE \"quair\" or \"guaer\", from OF \"quayer\", \"cayer\", (cf. modern Fr. cahier), from L. quaternum, \"by fours\", \"fourfold\". Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the association of \"quaire\" with \"four\" was quickly lost. [PAR] History [PAR] In the Middle Ages, a quire (also called a \"gathering\") was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term \"quaternion\" (or sometimes quaternum) designates such a quire. A quire made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a \"bifolium\" (plural \"bifolia\"); a \"binion\" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a \"quinion\" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian term for quire, quinterno di carta. [PAR] Formerly, when paper was packed at the paper mill, the top and bottom quires were made up of slightly damaged sheets (\"outsides\") to protect the good quires (\"insides\"). These outside quires were known as \"cassie quires\" (from Fr. cass\u00e9e, \"broken\"), or \"cording quires\" and had only 20 sheets to the quire.  The printer William Caslon in a book published in 1770 mentions both 24- and 25-sheet quires; he also details printer's wastage, and the sorting and recycling of damaged cassie quires.  An 1826 French manual on typography complained that cording quires (usually containing some salvageable paper) from the Netherlands barely contained a single good sheet.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Jungle BookThe Jungle Book (1894) is a collection of stories by English author Rudyard Kipling. The stories were first published in magazines in 1893\u201394. The original publications contain illustrations, some by the author's father, John Lockwood Kipling. Kipling was born in India and spent the first six years of his childhood there. After about ten years in England, he went back to India and worked there for about six-and-a-half years. These stories were written when Kipling lived in Naulakha, the home he built in Dummerston, Vermont (just north of Brattleboro), in the United States.  There is evidence that the collection of stories was written for his daughter Josephine, who died in 1899 at six years of age by pneumonia; a rare first edition of the book with a poignant handwritten note by the author to his young daughter was discovered at the National Trust's Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire in 2010.  [PAR] The tales in the book (as well as those in The Second Jungle Book which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. The verses of The Law of the Jungle, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families, and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or \"heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle.\"  Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time.  The best-known of them are the three stories revolving around the adventures of Mowgli, an abandoned \"man cub\" who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. The most famous of the other four stories are probably \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\", the story of a heroic mongoose, and \"Toomai of the Elephants\", the tale of a young elephant-handler. As with much of Kipling's work, each of the stories is followed by a piece of verse. [PAR] The Jungle Book came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts, a junior element of the Scouting movement. This use of the book's universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author's permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement, the name being traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Artwork highlights - Bubbles, by Sir John Everett MillaisArtwork details, Liverpool museums [PAR] See a larger version [PAR] About the artwork [PAR] One of the most famous paintings by the Victorian artist Sir John Millais has been placed on long loan at the Lady Lever Art Gallery. It has been lent by Unilever. [PAR] 'Bubbles' was painted in 1885-6. It shows a boy blowing bubbles with a pipe and a bowl of soap suds. The boy was the artist\u2019s grandson, Willie James, aged about four: he later became an Admiral. To get round the problems of painting the bubbles, the artist had a glass sphere specially manufactured. Millais originally titled his painting 'A Child\u2019s World' but it was later changed to 'Bubbles'. [PAR] As a young man, Millais was one of the chief artists in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , which set out to attack the complacency of the Royal Academy. He painted masterpieces such as 'Isabella' ( Walker Art Gallery ) and ' Ophelia ' ( Tate Britain ) in a new style with bright colours, wiry outlines and minute detail. By the time he painted 'Bubbles', Millais was in his 50s. He had abandoned the Pre-Raphaelite style and had adopted darker colours and looser brushwork.\u00a0 No longer a rebel, he had joined the Royal Academy and had become a pillar of the art establishment. Much of his work at this stage in his career featured sentimental portrayals of small children. Other examples, at the Lady Lever Art Gallery, are 'Little Speedwell\u2019s Darling Blue' and 'The Nest'. [PAR] Although 'Bubbles' may appear sentimental to modern taste, it has a serious meaning. Millais was using a symbol with a long tradition behind it. 'Bubbles' are fragile and have a brief moment of beauty before they burst. In the 17th century Dutch artists painted children blowing bubbles to convey the brevity of human life, the transience of beauty and the inevitability of death. This theme appealed to Millais and is a key to several other of his paintings, such as ' Spring (Apple Blossoms) ' also at the Lady Lever Art Gallery. Amongst the beauty of the young girls and the spring flowers in this picture, Millais painted a scythe, to indicate that beauty fades and that death awaits us all. [PAR] This aspect of 'Bubbles' was not obvious to the Victorians. Victorian artists associated childhood with sweetness and innocence. The attitude is seen in the book illustrations of Kate Greenaway and in historical pictures such as 'And when did you last see your father?' by\u00a0 W. F. Yeames (Walker Art Gallery). It had also been seen in the 18th century in pictures like ' The Age of Innocence ' (Tate Britain) by Sir Joshua Reynolds , who was much admired by Millais. The interpretation of childhood changed radically after Freud wrote about it as a troubled period of latent sexuality, but it would be unhistorical to expect Millais to reflect these ideas in his work. [PAR] Listen to a recording of Julian Treuherz's gallery talk on 'Bubbles' online now . [PAR] The painting was brought from Millais by Sir William Ingram, proprietor of the Illustrated London News, a popular magazine with a wide circulation. Ingram also bought the copyright from the artist. He published 'Bubbles' as a special presentation colour print with the Christmas number of the magazine in 1887. (Other paintings of children by Millais had been published with previous Christmas numbers with great success.) [PAR] Before its appearance in the magazine, the painting with its copyright was sold to A & F Pears, manufacturers of Pears soap. The Managing Director of Pears, Thomas Barrett, was a pioneer of modern advertising methods, and he and William Lever of Lever Brothers, makers of Sunlight Soap, were great rivals, each spending vast sums on promoting their brands. [PAR] Barrett turned 'Bubbles' into an advertisement by adding a bar of soap in the foreground. Millais was furious, but he could do nothing about it. Millais was unfairly criticised for degrading his art, but as the copyright owner, Barrett was within his rights.\u00a0 And the use of",

It discusses the painting's history, its significance, and how it was used in advertising. The question asks who painted the famous picture 'Bubbles,' and the answer is 'Millais.'\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context describes 'Bubbles' as one of the most famous paintings by Sir John Millais, created in 1885-6. It highlights that the painting is a representation of the artist's grandson blowing bubbles. The context also provides information about Millais's artistic career, his association with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and his later adoption of different styles.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The painting 'Bubbles' is not just a simple portrayal of a child blowing bubbles but carries a deeper meaning related to the transience of life and beauty. The context explores how the painting's interpretation might have varied across different periods, including the Victorian era and later.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The original question is straightforward and factual. To increase its complexity, it could be rephrased to encourage deeper understanding or reflection.

[PAR] For administrative purposes, England outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly is divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. These counties may consist of a single district or be divided into several districts. As of April 2009, 27 of these counties are divided into districts and have a county council. Six of the counties, covering the major conurbations, are known as metropolitan counties, which do not have county councils, although some functions are organised on a county-wide basis by their districts (metropolitan boroughs) acting jointly. [PAR] All of England (including Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) is also divided into 48 ceremonial counties, which are also known as geographic counties. Most ceremonial counties correspond to a metropolitan or non-metropolitan county of the same name but often with reduced boundaries. [PAR] The current arrangement is the result of incremental reform. Many of the counties have their origins in the Middle Ages, although the larger counties of Yorkshire and Sussex lost many or all of their administrative functions centuries ago. The geographic counties which existed before the local government reforms of 1965 and 1974 are referred to as ancient counties or historic counties. From 1889 to 1974 areas with county councils were known as administrative counties, which excluded larger towns and cities known as county boroughs and included divisions of some geographic counties. From 1974 to 1996 the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, some of which were established only in 1974, corresponded directly with the ceremonial counties. [PAR] Counties, usually either historic counties or current ceremonial counties, are used as the geographical basis for a number of institutions such as police and fire services, sports clubs and other non-government organisations.

They are Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. [PAR] In these counties the district councils provide the majority of services. Similarly, Berkshire is a non-metropolitan county with no county council and multiple districts and maps directly to a ceremonial county. Bristol, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Northumberland and Rutland are ceremonial counties consisting of a non-metropolitan county of a single district, and are known as unitary authorities. [PAR] Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, East Sussex, Essex, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Somerset and Staffordshire are non-metropolitan counties with multiple districts and a county council, where one or more districts have been split off to form unitary authorities. The effect is that the corresponding ceremonial county is larger than the non-metropolitan county of the same name and the county council is responsible for providing services in only part of the county. In Cornwall, Durham, East Riding of Yorkshire, Shropshire and Wiltshire the bulk of the area is a unitary authority which shares the name of the ceremonial county and the rest of county is part of one or more other unitary authorities.

This rash of gang violence reached its bloody climax in a garage on the city\u2019s North Side on February 14, 1929, when seven men associated with the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, one of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, were shot to death by several men dressed as policemen. The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time. No one was ever brought to trial for the murders. [PAR] The Downfall of Public Enemy No. 1 [PAR] Though the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre marked the end of any significant gang opposition to Capone\u2019s rule in Chicago, it can also be said to have marked the beginning of his downfall. With his highly effective organization, his impressive income and his willingness to ruthlessly eliminate his rivals, Capone had become the country\u2019s most notorious gangster, and the newspapers dubbed him \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1.\u201d Federal authorities began investigating Capone after",

Elephants were particularly effective against horses, which would often bolt away in fear at the presence of the enormous beasts. [PAR] Was Alexander the Great really great? [PAR] A great conqueror, in 13 short years he amassed the largest empire in the entire ancient world \u2014 an empire that covered 3,000 miles. And he did this without the benefit of modern technology and weaponry. In his day, troop movements were primarily on foot, and communications were face to face. Not bad for a kid who became the King of Macedon at the age of 20. [PAR] Many of Alexander's accomplishments were made possible by his father, Philip of Macedon. Macedon, which existed roughly where the modern country of Macedonia lies today, was a kingdom located that lay geographically north of the Greek city-states. [PAR] Alexander's the Great's tutor was the Greek philosopher Aristotle. [PAR] In 338 B.C.E., King Philip of Macedon invaded and conquered the Greek city-states. Philip took advantage of the fact that the Greek city-states were divided by years of squabbling and infighting. Philip succeeded in doing what years of fighting between city-states had not done. He united Greece. [PAR] Conquering the World [PAR] Philip's next goal was to defeat Greece's age-old enemy to the east: Persia. For years, the massive Persian Empire threatened the very existence of the Greek way of life. But before he was able to pursue his second goal, Philip was assassinated. [PAR] This map shows Alexander the Great's massive empire and the route he took to conquer it. [PAR] When his son, Alexander, took the throne in 336 B.C.E., he vowed to complete the plans of his father. In 334 B.C.E., Alexander invaded Persia, which lay across the Aegean Sea in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). [PAR] After three grueling years of warfare and three decisive battles, Alexander smashed the Persian armies at the Tigris River and conquered the mighty Persian Empire, including the legendary city of Babylon. For many Greeks, this victory marked a moment of sweet revenge against a bitter foe. [PAR] (\u00a9 2000 by John J. Popovic, 1stMuse.com) [PAR] Alexander was an amazing soldier who led his army to conquer much of the known world. [PAR] At this point, at the age of 25, Alexander ruled an expansive empire. Nevertheless, his ambitions were not satisfied. While fighting the Persians, Alexander conquered Egypt and founded a city at the mouth of the Nile River. This city, which he named Alexandria after himself, became a cosmopolitan, diverse, bustling center of trade, the arts, and ideas. [PAR] But Alexander was not done. He continued his campaign, driving farther east, until he reached India and the Indus River in 326 B.C.E. At this point, his exhausted troops refused to fight further. They told Alexander that a truly great leader knows when it is time to stop fighting. [PAR] Without the support of his army, Alexander had no choice but to turn back and begin consolidating and organizing his far-flung empire. On his way home, Alexander died from disease in 323 B.C.E. [PAR] Though he was an unquestionably skilled and highly respected military leader, Alexander the Great was feared by those around him for his paranoia and dangerous temper.

First, his father was able to unite the Greek city-states, and Alexander destroyed the Persian Empire forever. More importantly, Alexander's conquests spread Greek culture, also known as Hellenism, across his empire.

[PAR] Bureau of Reclamation [PAR] Grand  Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River west of Spokane, Washington, is one of the  largest structures ever built by mankind--a mass of concrete standing 550 feet  high and 5,223 feet long, or just shy of a mile. Grand Coulee contains 12 million cubic yards  of concrete, or enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami. More massive than the Great Pyramid of Giza, Grand  Coulee is listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven  civil engineering wonders of the United States. Grand Coulee's reservoir,  Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, stretches 150  miles north, almost to the Canadian border. [PAR] A concrete gravity dam, Grand Coulee took  eight years to build, employed thousands of men during the Great Depression and,  when completed in 1942, provided the enormous electrical power necessary to  make aluminum, so essential for World War II production of planes and ships. It was  Grand Coulee, as well, that powered the production of plutonium at the nearby  Hanford Site, which figured prominently in the making of the atomic bomb. [PAR] So  grand was Grand Coulee Dam that in 1941 folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote \u201cThe  Song of the Grand Coulee Dam\u201d (though he was paid to do so under contract with  the Bonneville Power Administration.) \u201cBiggest  thing built by the hand of a Man,\u201d Guthrie sang. \u201cPower that sings, boys, turbines that whine.  Waters back up the Canadian Line.\u201d [PAR] Appropriate  as the word grand is for the dam, the  name Grand Coulee actually refers to a  unique geological feature created thousands of years ago when Ice Age glaciers  blocked the ancient riverbed of the Columbia River. When water eventually traveled under the ice  dam, great floods scoured out hundreds of miles of deep gulches, or coulees, in  the Columbia River Basin. One of these, the Grand  Coulee, is four miles wide and bordered on three sides by steep cliffs. [PAR] A local  proposal to dam the Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee dated to 1918, but  the idea faced strong competition from another proposal that called for an  irrigation canal to be built from the Pend Oreille River in northern Idaho. Proponents of this latter \u201cgravity plan\u201d argued that the hydroelectricity generated from the dam was not needed. Many studies followed, including one by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which took Grand Coulee\u2019s side, recommending a high dam  at the site and the pumping of irrigation water up to the surrounding  countryside. [PAR] This recommendation took hold with the Bureau  of Reclamation, which was promoting construction of multiple-use dams, through  which the production of hydroelectric power could produce revenue to help repay the construction cost of a project. (The Reclamation Act requires that beneficiaries of a project repay those costs, and a multi-purpose project reduced the payment burden on irrigators.) The recommendation found  traction with the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in a  time of great dust bowls and economic depression. Roosevelt launched federal program after  federal program in an attempt to spur the economy by \u201cpriming the pump\u201d and  providing jobs for out-of-work Americans.

This makes the Wimseys an unusually ancient family, since \"Very few English noble families go that far in the first creation; rebellions and monarchic head choppings had seen to that\" (as reviewer Janet Hitchman noted in the introduction to Striding Folly). The family coat of arms is blazoned as \"Sable, 3 mice courant, argent; crest, a domestic cat couched as to spring, proper\". The family motto, displayed under its coat of arms, is \"As my Whimsy takes me.\"  [PAR] Early life [PAR] Lord Peter was the second of the three children of Mortimer Wimsey, 15th Duke of Denver, and Honoria Lucasta Delagardie, who lives on throughout the novels as the Dowager Duchess of Denver. The Dowager Duchess is witty and intelligent, and strongly supports her younger son, whom she plainly prefers over his less intelligent, more conventional older brother, Gerald, the 16th Duke. Gerald's snobbish wife, Helen, who detests Wimsey, and their devil-may-care heir, Viscount St. George (Wimsey's nephew, who likes him), also make appearances in the novels. So does Lady Mary, the younger sister of the Duke and Lord Peter, who  leans strongly to the political left and scandalizes her family by marrying a policeman of working class origins. [PAR] Lord Peter Wimsey is called \"Lord\" by courtesy as the son of a Duke. He is not a peer and has no right to sit in the House of Lords, nor does this courtesy usage pass on to any offspring he may have. [PAR] As a boy, the young Peter Wimsey was, to the great distress of his father, strongly attached to an old, smelly poacher living at the edge of the family estate. [PAR] According to the novels, Lord Peter was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class degree in history. He was also an outstanding cricketer, whose performance would still be well remembered decades later, leading to the near unmasking",

The Devil\u2019s Coach Horse can sometimes be mistaken for an earwig but when threatened its scorpion-like posture will give the game away!         The Devil\u2019s Coach Horse belongs to the Rove Beetle family, called the Staphylinidae which are sometimes referred to as the \u2018Staphs\u2019 for short. There are approximately 1000 species of rove beetle (given this name as they are constantly on the move) found in the UK which amounts to roughly a quarter of all British beetles.    \u00a0 [PAR] Read more [PAR] The Devil\u2019s Coach Horse is the largest of the rove beetles and can reach a length of around 28mm. Typical to this family, the Devil\u2019s Coach Horse is a long-bodied, uniformly black beetle with an extended exposed powerful abdomen with shortened wing cases (elytra). Although able to fly its wings are rarely used. [PAR] The beetle is common in the UK and is found throughout Europe. It also inhabits parts of Australasia and the Americas but it is not native to these areas having been introduced. [PAR] The Devil\u2019s Coach Horse occupies a wide range of habitats requiring damp conditions and is common in woods, hedgerows, meadows, parks and gardens, being seen between April and October. It is also known to make its way indoors now and then, particularly in older properties. [PAR] 3,2,1....Fight!

In 1829 he was graduated second in his class at West Point without having incurred a single demerit in his four years there. Commissioned in the Corps of Engineers, he served as a captain under General Winfield Scott in the Mexican War, in which he distinguished himself in the battles of Veracruz , Churubusco, and Chapultepec. He was slightly wounded in that war and earned three brevets to colonel. General Scott declared him to be \u201cthe very best soldier that I ever saw in the field.\u201d [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Robert E. Lee graduated second in his class from West Point in 1829. He did not receive a single demerit during his four years at the academy. [PAR] In 1852 he was appointed superintendent of West Point. Three years later, with the approval of Jefferson Davis , then secretary of war, he transferred as a lieutenant colonel to the newly raised Second Cavalry and served in West Texas . [PAR] Although John Brown\u2019s raid on the U.S. Arsenal and Armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia ), in October 1859 occurred while Lee was at his home on extended leave in Arlington, Virginia, he was placed in command of a detachment of marines and, with Second Lieutenant J. E. B. Stuart, captured Brown and his band. [PAR] On April 20, 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War , he resigned his commission and three days later was appointed by Governor John Letcher of Virginia to be commander in chief of the military and naval forces of the state. When Virginia\u2019s troops were transferred to the Confederate service, he became, on May 14, 1861, a brigadier general, the highest rank then authorized. Soon after he was promoted to full general. [PAR] Lee\u2019s first field command was in the western part of the state, where he failed to hold back invading Union forces in an area of strong pro-Union sentiment. He was recalled to Richmond, and from March 1862 he was military adviser to President Davis. From this position he was able to influence some operations, notably those of General Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson in his Shenandoah Valley campaign. [PAR] When General Joseph E. Johnston was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, Lee took command of what became the Army of Northern Virginia. He successfully repulsed the efforts of Union general George McClellan in the Peninsular campaign, concluding with the Battles of Seven Days: Oak Grove, Mechanicsville, Gaine\u2019s Mill, Garnett\u2019s and Golding\u2019s Farms, Savage\u2019s Station and Allen\u2019s Farm, White Oak Swamp, and Malvern Hill. Victories were won through Lee\u2019s aggressiveness and daring in the face of McClellan\u2019s timidity rather than by any comprehensive generalship on Lee\u2019s part, for he was unable to exercise control over his subordinate commanders, and the individual battles could be considered tactical defeats. [PAR] On August 29-30, he defeated General John Pope in the second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), but when he invaded Maryland he was checked on September 17 by Union forces under McClellan at Antietam. Here, even after the bloodiest day of the entire war, Lee held on and was willing to fight on the same field another day. On December 13, he defeated General Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg, and it was here that he made the remark to General James Longstreet that many of his admirers have tried to explain away: \u201cIt is well war is so terrible\u2013we would grow too fond of it.\u201d Lee loved fighting a war. [PAR] Lee\u2019s most brilliantly fought battle was the defeat of Joseph Hooker at Chancellorsville on May 1-4, 1863.

Many of these changes to city names were done to make those names reflect the linguistic systems in the various areas. [PAR] The following is a brief history of some of India's most famous name changes: [PAR] Mumbai vs. Bombay [PAR] Mumbai is one of the world's ten largest cities today and is located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. This world-class city wasn't always known by this name however. Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay, which has its origins in the 1600s with the Portuguese. During their colonization of the area, they began calling it Bombaim - Portuguese for \"Good Bay.\" In 1661 though, this Portuguese colony was given to King Charles II of England after he married the Portuguese princess Catherine de Braganza. When the British then took control of the colony, its name became Bombay- an anglicized version of Bombaim. [PAR] The name Bombay then stuck until 1996 when the Indian government changed it to Mumbai. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] It is believed that this was the name of a Kolis settlement in the same area because many Kolis communities were named after their Hindu deities. By the early 20th Century, one of these settlements was named Mumbadevi for a goddess of the same name. [PAR] Therefore the change to the name of Mumbai in 1996 was an attempt to use the previous Hindi names for a city that was once controlled by the British. The use of the name Mumbai reached a global scale in 2006 when the Associated Press announced it would refer to what was once Bombay as Mumbai. [PAR] Chennai vs. Madras [PAR] However, Mumbai was not the only newly named Indian city in 1996. In August of that same year, the former city of Madras, located in the state of Tamil Nadu, had its name changed to Chennai. [PAR] Both the names Chennai and Madras date back to 1639. In that year, the Raja of Chandragiri, (a suburb in South India), allowed the British East India Company to build a fort near the town of Madraspattinam. At the same time, the local people built another town close to the site of the fort. This town was named Chennappatnam, after the father of one of the early rulers. Later, both the fort and the town grew together but the British shortened their colony's name to Madras while the Indians changed theirs to Chennai. [PAR] The name Madras (shortened from Madraspattinam) also has links to the Portuguese who were present in the area as early as the 1500s. Their exact impact on the naming of the area is unclear however and many rumors exist as to how the name really originated. Many historians believe that it may have come from the Madeiros family who lived there in the 1500s. [PAR] No matter where it originated though, Madras is a much older name than Chennai. Despite that fact, the city was still renamed Chennai because it is in the language of the area\u2019s original inhabitants and Madras was seen as being a Portuguese name and/or was associated with the former British colony. [PAR] Kolkata vs. Calcutta [PAR] More recently, in January 2001, one of the world's 25 largest cities, Calcutta, became Kolkata. At the same time the city\u2019s name changed, its state changed from West Bengal to Bangla as well. Like Madras, the origin of the name Kolkata is disputed.

Around 70,000 racing fans will\u00a0watch the race live making it one of the biggest sporting events in the calendar. [PAR] Course [PAR] The Grand National course is 4 miles and 4 furlongs long. The horses encounter 16 different fences\u00a0with varying degrees of height and width. Riders must navigate two circuits of the course (missing out fences 15 & 16 on the second circuit)\u00a0before turning for\u00a0the home straight which is the longest run-in of any UK racecourse. [PAR] The Grand National is the longest race in the UK but it\u2019s the difficulty for the fences that provide the real challenge\u00a0to horse and rider. Just a\u00a0mention of the fences Becher\u2019s Brook, The Chair and the Canal Turn make a jockey\u2019s blood run cold. [PAR] Often called the \u2018Original Extreme Sport\u2019\u00a0steeplechase races originated in Ireland. Legend has it that the\u00a0first race\u00a0was\u00a0between Cornelius O\u2019Callaghan and Edmund Blake as they raced from\u00a0Buttevant Church to St. Leger Church, or from steeple to steeple, hence the term steeplechase. Those original cross country races are now replicated on racecourses across England and Ireland. However, the Aintree course is arguably the toughest of all. Jockeys\u00a0no longer have to jump a stone wall at Aintree or cross the ploughed field, but the water jumps, brooks and ditches still feature on many of its\u00a0fences. [PAR] Famous Fences [PAR] THE GRAND NATIONAL FENCES [PAR] Few races can claim to have famous fences, maybe with the exception of the infamous \u2018Taxis\u2019 fence in the Velk\u00e1 pardubick\u00e1, no other race can rival the Grand National for fearsome jumps. [PAR] Of the 16 fences which make up the National course six of the\u00a0jumps have become famous in their own right. Becher\u2019s Brook, Valentines\u2019 Brook, The Chair, Canal Turn and Foinavon are names which are known throughout the world. These fences are woven into the very fabric of the Grand National race. [PAR] Becher\u2019s Brook [PAR] Becher\u2019s Brook is the the 6th and 22nd fence in the Grand National.

    "orig_question": "What is a male otter called?",
    "orig_answer": "dogs",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] OtterOtter is a common name for a carnivorous mammal in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the weasel family Mustelidae, which also includes badgers, honey badgers, martens, minks, polecats, weasels and wolverines. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This, and cognate words in other Indo-European languages, ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European language root *w\u00f3dr\u0325, which also gave rise to the English word \"water\".   [PAR] Terminology [PAR] An otter's den is called a holt or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars, females are called bitches or sows, and their offspring are called pups.  The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp (being descriptive of their often playful nature) or, when in water, raft.   [PAR] The feces of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish;[http://archive.today/20120908081151/http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm Spraint Analysis]. ottersite.btinternet.co.uk these are known as spraints.  [PAR] Life cycle [PAR] The gestation period in otters is about 60 to 86 days.  The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog and older offspring.  Bitch otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years.  The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland.  It is lined with moss and grass. [PAR] After one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim.  The pup lives with its family for approximately one year.  Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups.  Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds. [PAR] Characteristics [PAR] Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from  in length and 1 to in weight. The Oriental small-clawed otter is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water. [PAR] Several otter species live in cold waters and have high metabolic rates to help keep them warm. European otters must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and sea otters 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as 10 \u00b0C, an otter needs to catch 100 g of fish per hour to survive. Most species hunt for three to five hours each day and nursing mothers up to eight hours each day. [PAR] For most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, crayfish and crabs.  Some otters are expert at opening shellfish, and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of clams, sea urchins and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their stomachs. This skill must be learned by the young.  [PAR] Otters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic and live in the ocean for most of their lives. [PAR] Otters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Shipping ForecastThe Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the British Isles.  It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day. The broadcast finishes at approximately 0058. [PAR] * 0520 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from coastal stations at 0525, and an inshore waters forecast at 0527. [PAR] * 1201 \u2013 normally transmitted on LW only. [PAR] * 1754 \u2013 transmitted only on LW on weekdays, as an opt-out from the PM programme, but at weekends transmitted on both FM and LW. [PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.  [PAR] Region names [PAR] The 31 sea areas covering the waters around the British Isles are as defined by the map shown here: [PAR] * Viking [PAR] * North Utsire [PAR] * South Utsire [PAR] * Forties [PAR] * Cromarty [PAR] * Forth [PAR] * Tyne [PAR] * Dogger [PAR] * Fisher [PAR] * German Bight [PAR] * Humber [PAR] * Thames [PAR] * Dover [PAR] * Wight [PAR] * Portland [PAR] * Plymouth [PAR] * Biscay [PAR] * Trafalgar [PAR] * FitzRoy [PAR] * Sole [PAR] * Lundy [PAR] * Fastnet [PAR] * Irish Sea [PAR] * Shannon [PAR] * Rockall [PAR] * Malin [PAR] * Hebrides [PAR] * Bailey [PAR] * Fair Isle [PAR] * Faeroes [PAR] * Southeast Iceland [PAR] The areas were already roughly as listed above by 1949. Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

It includes information about the broadcast times, the division of the waters into 31 sea areas, and the history of the Shipping Forecast.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the question and answer\nThe original question is \"Which Shipping Forecast area lies south of Sole?\" and the answer is \"fitzroy.\" We need to understand the geographical arrangement of the sea areas to verify this.\n\n## Step 4: Identify relevant information in the context\nThe context lists the 31 sea areas in a specific order: Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger, Fisher, German Bight, Humber, Thames, Dover, Wight, Portland, Plymouth, Biscay, Trafalgar, FitzRoy, Sole, Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea, Shannon, Rockall, Malin, Hebrides, Bailey, Fair Isle, Faeroes, Southeast Iceland. The areas are named in a roughly clockwise direction.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the geographical relationship between Sole and FitzRoy\nTo verify if FitzRoy is south of Sole, we need to look at their positions in the list and understand the geographical layout. The list provided shows the order of the sea areas. Sole is followed by Lundy, Fastnet, and then areas to the north and west, indicating that FitzRoy is actually north of Sole because it appears before Sole in the list.\n\n## Step 6: Verify the correct answer based on the geographical order\nGiven the order: ...Trafalgar, FitzRoy, Sole, Lundy..., FitzRoy is indeed north of Sole, not south. This indicates a potential mistake in the original answer or a misunderstanding of the geography.\n\n## Step 7: Re-evaluate the question and provide a corrected version\nSince FitzRoy is north of Sole, we need to identify which area is south of Sole. The area immediately after Sole is Lundy, suggesting Lundy is south or more accurately, comes after Sole in the sequence.\n\n## Step 8: Generate a new question-answer pair\nThe original question asks for the area south of Sole.

For example, instead of directly asking for the country, we could ask for the specific coast or region associated with the \"Elephanta\" wind, or we could frame it in a way that requires understanding the timing or characteristics of the wind.\n\n## Step 6: Generate a new question-answer pair based on the analysis\nGiven the information and the need to create a semantically equivalent question, we can rephrase the question to: \"Which country's Malabar coast is affected by the 'Elephanta', a strong southerly or southeasterly wind during September and October?\" The answer remains \"India\".\n\n## Step 7: Format the new question-answer pair according to the output structure\nTo adhere to the output format, we need to create multiple-choice options and ensure the question is clear and self-contained.\n\n## Step 8: Create multiple-choice options\nA: Sri Lanka  \nB: India  \nC: Bangladesh  \nD: Myanmar\n\n## Step 9: Verify the correctness and clarity of the question and answer options\nThe question is: \"Which country's Malabar coast is affected by the 'Elephanta', a strong southerly or southeasterly wind during September and October?\" The correct answer is \"India\", which corresponds to option B.\n\n## Step 10: Provide the final output in the required format\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Which country's Malabar coast is affected by the 'Elephanta', a strong southerly or southeasterly wind during September and October?\nA: Sri Lanka\nB: India\nC: Bangladesh\nD: Myanmar\nExplanation: The 'Elephanta' is described as a strong southerly or southeasterly wind that blows on the Malabar coast of India, marking the end of the southwest monsoon during September and October.\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Which country's Malabar coast is affected by the 'Elephanta', a strong southerly or southeasterly wind during September and October?\nA: Sri Lanka\nB: India\nC: Bangladesh\nD: Myanmar\nExplanation: The 'Elephanta' is described as a strong southerly or southeasterly wind that blows on the Malabar coast of India, marking the end of the southwest monsoon during September and October.\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Kaiser Wilhelm II - World War I - HISTORY.comKaiser Wilhelm II - World War I - HISTORY.com [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II [PAR] A+E Networks [PAR] Introduction [PAR] Wilhelm II (1859-1941), the German kaiser (emperor) and king of Prussia from 1888 to 1918, was one of the most recognizable public figures of World War I (1914-18). He gained a reputation as a swaggering militarist through his speeches and ill-advised newspaper interviews. While Wilhelm did not actively seek war, and tried to hold back his generals from mobilizing the German army in the summer of 1914, his verbal outbursts and his open enjoyment of the title of Supreme War Lord helped bolster the case of those who blamed him for the conflict. His role in the conduct of the war as well as his responsibility for its outbreak is still controversial. Some historians maintain that Wilhelm was controlled by his generals, while others argue that he retained considerable political power. In late 1918, he was forced to abdicate. He spent the rest of his life in exile in the Netherlands, where he died at age 82. [PAR] Google [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s Early Years [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was born in Potsdam, Germany, on January 27, 1859, the son of Prince Frederick Wilhelm of Prussia (1831-88) and Princess Victoria (1840-1901), the oldest daughter of Queen Victoria of England (1819-1901). The future monarch was the queen\u2019s firstborn grandchild and was genuinely fond of her; in fact, he was holding her in his arms when she died. His ties to Britain through its royal family would play an important part in his later political maneuvering. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was reportedly amused when he heard his cousin King George V (1865-1936) had changed the name of the British royal family from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor in 1917 as a result of anti-German sentiment in Britain during World War I. [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s childhood was shaped by two events, one medical and one political. His birth had been traumatic; in the course of a complicated delivery, the doctor permanently damaged Wilhelm\u2019s left arm. In addition to its smaller size, the arm was useless for such ordinary tasks as cutting certain foods with a knife at mealtime. [PAR] The political event that shaped Wilhelm was the formation of the German Empire under the leadership of Prussia in 1871. Wilhelm was now second in line after his father to become an emperor as well as king of Prussia. Twelve years old at the time, Wilhelm was filled with nationalistic enthusiasm. His later determination to win a \u201cplace in the sun\u201d for Germany had its roots in his childhood. [PAR] An intelligent young man who possessed a lifelong interest in science and technology, Wilhelm was educated at the University of Bonn. His quick mind, however, was combined with an even quicker temper and an impulsive, high-strung personality. He had dysfunctional relationships with both parents, particularly his English mother. Historians still debate the effects of the kaiser\u2019s complicated psychological makeup on his political decisions. [PAR] In 1881, Wilhelm married Princess Augusta Victoria (1858-1921) of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple would go on to have seven children. [PAR] Emperor and King: 1888 [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s father became Kaiser Frederick III of Germany in March 1888. Already ill with terminal throat cancer, he died after a reign of only several months. Wilhelm succeeded his father on June 15, 1888, at the age of 29. Within two years of his coronation, Wilhelm broke with Otto von Bismarck (1815-98), the \u201cIron Chancellor\u201d who had dominated German politics since the 1860s. The kaiser embarked on his so-called New Course, a period of personal rule in which he appointed chancellors who were upper-level civil servants rather than statesmen. Bismarck bitterly predicted that Wilhelm would lead Germany to ruin. [PAR] Wilhelm damaged his political position in a number of ways. He meddled in German foreign policy on the basis of his emotions, resulting in incoherence and inconsistency in German relations with other nations. He also made a number of public",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak. As Tex, his horse, and dog are very thirsty, Kalamakooya",
