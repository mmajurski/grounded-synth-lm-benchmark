Tucker spent most of his first season on the \"taxi-squad\" while learning behind the Rams' starting flanker Bernie Casey.  Tucker saw action in 10 of the team's 14 games in 1968 (catching only 7 passes but 4 of them went for touchdowns), and then became the starting flanker after Casey's retirement.  The 1969 season would prove to be his most productive as, playing opposite wide receiver Jack Snow, he caught 38 passes for 629 yards and 7 touchdowns, including a 93 yarder vs. the 49ers for the Coastal Division champion Rams.  Tucker returned in 1970 but was hampered by injuries and caught only 12 passes in 12 games.  In May 1971, Tucker was traded along with Billy Truax to the Dallas Cowboys for receiver Lance Rentzel.

Tucker spent most of his first season on the \"taxi-squad\" while learning behind the Rams' starting flanker Bernie Casey.  Tucker saw action in 10 of the team's 14 games in 1968 (catching only 7 passes but 4 of them went for touchdowns), and then became the starting flanker after Casey's retirement.  The 1969 season would prove to be his most productive as, playing opposite wide receiver Jack Snow, he caught 38 passes for 629 yards and 7 touchdowns, including a 93 yarder vs. the 49ers for the Coastal Division champion Rams.  Tucker returned in 1970 but was hampered by injuries and caught only 12 passes in 12 games.  In May 1971, Tucker was traded along with Billy Truax to the Dallas Cowboys for receiver Lance Rentzel.
