We first examine methods that enhance static benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap\u2014the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for dynamic benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing dynamic benchmarks.\n\nThis survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts.\n\nWe maintain a GitHub repository to continuously collect both static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs. The repository can be found at this link\u00a0111GitHub Link: Static-to-Dynamic LLM Benchmarking.\n",

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains. Lastly, we encourage further exploration of ethical guidelines surrounding data usage, model transparency, and the broader societal impact of AI benchmarks.\n",

The question also requires the domain expert to think critically about how to use collision rates to improve the reliability of dynamic benchmarks.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nThe question is designed to encourage the domain expert to think deeply about the challenges of dynamic benchmarking and the importance of evaluating the robustness of benchmarks against data contamination. The question requires the domain expert to consider the implications of collision metrics on the reliability of dynamic benchmarks and to think creatively about how to use these metrics to improve the benchmarking process.\n\n## <output_format>\nQuestion: Explain how to use collision rates to improve the reliability of dynamic benchmarks.\nExplanation: Collision rates can be used to improve the reliability of dynamic benchmarks by providing a quantitative measure of the extent of data contamination.

Collision refers to the overlap between different transformations of the benchmark dataset, which can limit the benchmark's ability to generate novel test cases. The proposed metrics, Collision Rate and Repeat Trials, aim to quantify this overlap and assess the benchmark's effectiveness.\n\nUpon careful examination, it becomes apparent that collision rates have limitations as a metric for evaluating dynamic benchmarking. Firstly, collision rates do not account for the diversity of the test cases generated by the benchmark. Even if the Collision Rate is low, the benchmark may still produce test cases that are highly similar, rendering it ineffective in evaluating LLM capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, collision rates may not accurately capture the complexity of the benchmark's ability to generate novel variations. A low Collision Rate may indicate that the benchmark is able to produce highly diverse test cases, but it may not necessarily imply that the benchmark is robust against potential training data contamination.\n\nAdditionally, the context highlights the importance of considering the Repeat Trials metric, which quantifies the expected number of transformation trials required to fully regenerate an existing transformed dataset. This metric provides valuable insight into the benchmark's ability to produce novel variations, but it is not a direct measure of collision.\n\nIn conclusion, while collision rates can provide some insights into the robustness of dynamic benchmarking, they have significant limitations as a standalone metric.

Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking.
