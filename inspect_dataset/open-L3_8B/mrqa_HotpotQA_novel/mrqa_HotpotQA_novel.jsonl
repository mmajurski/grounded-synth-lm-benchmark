    "response": "<document_analysis>\n\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nThe provided context discusses the Special Division, a division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It consists of three circuit court judges or justices appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, with specific requirements for their appointments and terms. The context also mentions the constitutionality of the Special Division, citing the case Morrison v. Olson.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nUpon examining the context, it is clear that the Special Division is a unique entity with specific rules governing its composition and operations. The 2-year term limit for judges on the Special Division is a crucial aspect of its design, as it ensures that the division remains impartial and independent. This term limit also raises questions about the potential impact on the division's decision-making processes and operations.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI rate the difficulty of this question as 8 out of 10, as it requires a deep understanding of the Special Division's structure and operations, as well as the implications of the 2-year term limit on its decision-making processes.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nThe question is designed to invite deeper understanding and reflection on the impact of the 2-year term limit on the Special Division's operations and decision-making processes. It requires the domain expert to consider the potential consequences of this term limit and how it might affect the division's ability to make impartial decisions.\n\n### Identification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information\n\nThe context mentions the case Morrison v.
