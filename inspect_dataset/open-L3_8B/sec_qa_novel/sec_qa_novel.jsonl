Length plays an important role. The\n\nlonger the key, the hard it is to *crack* the encryption. Likewise the randomness of the data in the key also makes it\n\nstronger.

Mathematical Foundation {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mathematical_foundation}\nCryptography relies largely on the concept of one-way or trap door functions. That is a process that is hard to compute\n\nin one direction, but easy to compute in the other. For example it is much easier for a computer to multiply large\n\nnumbers than to determine the factors of large numbers. This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm. [A simplified\n\nversion of the algorithm](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jpopyack/IntroCS/HW/RSAWorksheet.html){.link} is shown below:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>KEY GENERATION\n\np = a random prime number\n\nq = a random prime number\n\nN = p * q\n\nr = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\n\nK = a number which equals one when modded by r and can be factored\n\ne = a factor of K that doesn&#39;t share factors with N\n\nd = another factor of K that doesn&#39;t share factors with N\n\nYour public key is N and e\n\nYour private key is N and d\n\nENCRYPTION\n\nciphertext = (cleartext**e)%N\n\nDECRYPTION\n\ncleartext = (ciphertext**d)%N\n\nEXAMPLE\n\np = 7\n\nq = 13\n\nN = 7 * 13 = 91\n\nr = 72\n\nK = 145 (because 145%72 = 1)\n\ne = 5\n\nd = 29\n\nPublic Key = 91, 5\n\nPrivate Key = 91, 29\n\ncleartext = 72 (&#39;H&#39; in ASCII)\n\nciphertext = (72**5)%91 = 11 (encrypted using N and e)\n\ncleartext = (11**29)%91 = 72 (decrypted using N and d)</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn order to *crack* RSA you would need to be able to factor N into its two prime numbers. While it is trivial in our\n\nsimple example, imagine how difficult it would be to [factor a number with 1400 decimal\n\ndigits,](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11832022/why-are-large-prime-numbers-used-in-rsa-encryption){.link} the\n\ncurrent recommended keysize for RSA. You'll notice that the algorithm only requires exponentiation, multiplication, and\n\nmodulus arithmetic. At no point do you ever have to factor a large prime number to generate keys, encrypt, or decrypt.\n\nYou only have to perform that operation if you're trying to work backwards without the keys.\n\nOther similar one-way function exist based on elliptical curves. It turns out that motion along an elliptical curve can\n\nbe described according to a start and end point and several iterations of a simple algorithm. You can reconstruct the\n\ninitial conditions if you know the start point, end point, and how many iterations it took. If all you know is the start\n\nand end point you can't determine the initial conditions.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.5. Hashes\"}\n",

MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}\nThere are several different authorization models that can be used. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

Physical Access\"}\n</context>\n\n<document_analysis>\nThoughtful Content Examination:\nThe provided context discusses various authorization models, including DAC, MAC, RBAC, and ABAC, and their respective strengths and weaknesses. The central idea revolves around the comparison of these models, highlighting their differences in access control, flexibility, and complexity. The table provided in the context serves as a visual aid, summarizing the key factors and characteristics of each model.\n\nConcept Exploration:\nUpon closer examination, it becomes apparent that DAC is a simpler model that relies on the discretion of the object's owner to determine access permissions. This approach offers great flexibility but can lead to a less secure environment if the owner is compromised. In contrast, MAC requires a more stringent form of access control, which, although more secure, demands a significant amount of effort to implement and maintain.\n\nStrategic Complexity Calibration:\nI would rate the difficulty of this topic as an 8 out of 10. The subject matter requires a good understanding of authorization models, their characteristics, and the implications of using each model in a high-security environment. The table provided in the context adds an additional layer of complexity, as it requires the reader to analyze and compare the different models.\n\nIntentional Question Planning:\nThe question should invite deeper understanding and critical engagement with the content. It should encourage the reader to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of using DAC in a high-security environment.\n\nIdentification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information:\nI have explicitly disregarded the hyperlinks, headers, and footers, as they are not relevant to the core information of the text chunk. The table provided in the context is essential to understanding the comparison between the different authorization models.\n\nDecision Criteria for Question Generation:\nThe provided context contains meaningful, coherent, and educationally valuable content. I will generate a question that encourages thoughtful engagement and critical reflection on the topic.\n\nThought Process:\nTo generate a question that inspires genuine curiosity and reflection, I will focus on the strengths and weaknesses of using DAC in a high-security environment. I will create a question that requires the reader to analyze the characteristics of DAC and its implications in a high-security setting.\n\nRationale:\nThe question I will generate is designed to challenge the domain expert's understanding of DAC and its limitations in a high-security environment. The question requires the reader to think critically and reflect on the potential consequences of using DAC in such an environment.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What are the primary concerns and limitations of using Discretionary Access Control (DAC) in a high-security environment, and how do these compare to the strengths and weaknesses of other authorization models?\nExplanation: This question requires the reader to critically evaluate the characteristics of DAC and its implications in a high-security setting, considering the trade-offs between flexibility and security.\nCorrect Answer: The primary concern of using DAC in a high-security environment is the potential for a compromised owner to grant unauthorized access, leading to a less secure environment. Additionally, DAC may not provide the same level of security as other models, such as MAC, which can result in a more secure environment but at the cost of increased complexity and implementation effort.\n</output_format>",

Reporting {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__reporting}\nReporting is a critical step. It is important to collect timestamped logs as well as accounts of how the incident plans\n\nwere rolled out. This can help you determine if the plans should be changed and can help you know what to look for in\n\nthe future. In the best case scenario good reporting lets you catch future precursors before they become incidents.\n\nDisclosure is also an important aspect of the reporting phase.

    "context": "### 4.4.14. FTP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ftp}\nFile Transfer Protocol is a relatively simple, text-based protocol for sending files between machines. FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended. SFTP uses an SSH connection to send and receive files over an encrypted\n\nchannel. SFTP also supports all SSH authentication methods.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.4.15. SNMP\"}\n",

You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes. In a case of \\\"everything old is new again\\\" this isn't true.

They are typically marketed as either stand-alone devices,\n\nsoftware to install on internal devices, or a subscription service that routes traffic through an external appliance. In\n\nthe age of cloud computing network security as a service is becoming increasingly popular.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.1. Firewall\"}\n\n\n### 6.3.1. Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

The discussion highlights their roles in verifying IDs, enforcing rules, and providing an \"always on\" view of a location, respectively. Furthermore, it touches upon the benefits of combining these assets, including the potential to persuade attackers to aim for easier targets and the provision of evidence for future security decisions.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the collaboration between security guards and cameras can lead to a multi-layered security approach. This synergy can enable the detection and prevention of potential security breaches, as well as the identification and apprehension of perpetrators. Moreover, the integration of these assets can foster a culture of awareness and accountability among employees and visitors, thereby contributing to a more secure environment.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI rate the difficulty level of this topic as 8 out of 10, as it requires a deep understanding of security planning, asset utilization, and the implications of combining different security measures.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nGiven the complexity and nuances of this topic, the question should aim to encourage a thoughtful examination of the potential benefits and limitations of this collaboration. By doing so, the respondent will be forced to consider the strategic implications of integrating security guards and cameras, as well as the potential consequences of this approach.\n\n### Identification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information\n\nUpon reviewing the provided context, I have identified the following irrelevant information:\n\n- The image of the CCTV camera, as it does not contribute to the discussion of security guards and cameras.\n- The aside section about CCTV in London, as it is not relevant to the main topic.\n\n### Decision Criteria for Question Generation\n\nBased on the analysis, I have determined that the provided context contains meaningful, coherent, and educationally valuable content. Therefore, I will generate a question-answer pair that encourages a deep understanding of the topic.\n\n### Rationale for Exclusion or Inclusion Decisions\n\nThe context paragraph provides a clear and concise explanation of the roles and benefits of security guards and cameras.

SSH Keys\"}\n\n\n### 7.3.7. SSH Keys {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ssh_keys}\nSecure Shell Server (SSH) supports the use of asymmetric encryption keys for authentication. Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data.

Reporting {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__reporting}\nReporting is a critical step. It is important to collect timestamped logs as well as accounts of how the incident plans\n\nwere rolled out. This can help you determine if the plans should be changed and can help you know what to look for in\n\nthe future. In the best case scenario good reporting lets you catch future precursors before they become incidents.\n\nDisclosure is also an important aspect of the reporting phase. Both compliance and basic ethics mandate that customers\n\nbe made aware of any data lost. By disclosing the details of an incident you can also other companies aware of what\n\ntypes of attacks are occurring \\\"in the wild.\\\"\n\n:::\n\n:::::::::::::::\n\n::::::::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"9.5.

Remediation focuses on preventing future incidents, while reporting is a critical step in collecting data and disclosing information about incidents. The context also mentions the importance of compliance, ethics, and awareness.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nImplicit assumptions in the context include the importance of learning from past incidents and the need for transparency in incident response. The underlying theory is that effective incident response requires a combination of prevention, detection, and response strategies.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI rate the difficulty of the question as 8 out of 10, as it requires a deep understanding of incident response and the role of frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nThe question invites deeper understanding by asking about the benefits of using a framework like MITRE ATT&CK in incident response. This requires the domain expert to consider the potential advantages of using such a framework, such as improved incident detection and response, enhanced compliance, and better awareness of emerging threats.\n\n### Identification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information\n\nI have disregarded the hyperlinks, headers, and footers in the provided context, as they are not relevant to the core information.\n\n### Decision Criteria for Question Generation\n\nThe context contains meaningful and coherent information about incident response, remediation, and reporting. Therefore, I have generated a question that is relevant and challenging.\n\n### Documentation in Analysis\n\nI have carefully examined the context and identified the relevant information.

Kerberos\n\nmakes extensive use of time-based tickets and as such all client participating must have their clocks in sync.

    "response": "## <document_analysis>\n\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nCarefully analyzing the provided context, we identify central ideas such as Kerberos as an authentication protocol for client-server connections, its development by MIT in the 1980s, and its deployment on Windows networks and Linux distributions. The text also highlights the importance of time-based tickets and the need for client clocks to be in sync. Furthermore, it explains the various services and concepts used by Kerberos, including the Authentication Server (AS), Ticket-Granting Service (TGS), Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGT), Key Distribution Center (KDC), and Service Principle Name (SPN).\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nImplicit assumptions in the provided information include the reliance on time-based tickets for authentication and the need for clients to be in sync with the server. Subtle details mentioned include the use of abbreviations for services and concepts, such as AS, TGS, TGT, KDC, and SPN. The underlying theory of Kerberos is based on secure authentication and authorization, ensuring that clients can access services only if they have the necessary permissions. Potential applications of Kerberos include secure access to network resources, such as file shares, printers, and databases.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nDifficulty level: 8/10\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nTo plan a question that invites deeper understanding, meaningful reflection, or critical engagement, we consider the complexity of the topic and the need to challenge domain experts.

The correct answer should accurately describe the sequence of events, highlighting the roles of each component in the authentication process.\n\nCorrect Answer: When a client initiates a Kerberos authentication process, it first reaches out to the Authentication Server (AS), which obtains a Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) from the Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) running on the Key Distribution Center (KDC). The client then uses the TGT to obtain a service ticket from the TGS, which it can use to access the desired service.\n\n</output_format>",

Some of these services may run on the\n\nsame machine and they are almost always abbreviated:\n\n::: description-list\n\n[Authentication Server (AS)]{.term}\n\n:   [performs the authentication step with clients]{.principal}\n\n[Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)]{.term}\n\n:   [service which creates and signs tickets]{.principal}\n\n[Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGT)]{.term}\n\n:   [time stamped and encrypted (with the TGS secret key) ticket that grants the ability to create tickets and sessions\n\n    for services]{.principal}\n\n[Key Distribution Center (KDC)]{.term}\n\n:   [runs the TGS and grants TGTs]{.principal}\n\n[Service Principle Name (SPN)]{.term}\n\n:   [name of a service that uses Kerberos authentication]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nTo sign in and client reaches out to the AS which gets a TGT from the TGS running on the KDC and gives it to the client.\n\nThe client gets the SPN of the service it wants to utilize and sends it along with the TGT to the TGS. Assuming the\n\nclient has permission to access the service the TGS issues a ticket and session to the client. The ticket is then used\n\nto connect to the service.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Golden Ticket\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n",

Key components of Kerberos include the Authentication Server (AS), Ticket-Granting Service (TGS), Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGT), Key Distribution Center (KDC), and Service Principle Name (SPN). The process involves the client reaching out to the AS, obtaining a TGT, and then using this TGT to request a ticket and session from the TGS running on the KDC.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nUpon examination, it is clear that the KDC plays a crucial role in the Kerberos authentication process. The KDC is responsible for running the TGS and granting TGTs. This suggests that the KDC is essential for facilitating the authentication process.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nThe difficulty level of this question is rated at 8 out of 10.

Symmetric Encryption {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__symmetric_encryption}\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/symmetric.svg\" width=\"550\" alt=\"symmetric\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSymmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand in that it only uses a single key (in this case\n\nour key is labelled \\'A\\') to encrypt or decrypt data. Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7. Asymmetric Encryption\"}\n",

Encryption can be employed to\n\n    make copies of data obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do not have the key.

When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes. In a case of \\\"everything old is new again\\\" this isn't true. [Blake Berry\n\n(HackingIntoYourHeart) discovered that several makes and models of cars are actually still vulnerable to a replay\n\nattack.](https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty/blob/main/README.md){.link}\n\nSammy Kamkar also discovered a vulnerablility for rolling codes, named RollJam, which he demonstrated at DEF CON 23.\n\nKamkar's device jams signals sent by a keyfob, while recording the codes being sent. Once it has two codes recorded,\n\npresumably from the victim pressing the button multiple times, it stops jamming, sends out the first code to unlock the\n\ncar and stores the second code to unlock the car at a later time.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.10.

However, it also reveals that despite advancements in technology, some car manufacturers still employ vulnerable systems susceptible to replay attacks.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nThe concept of replay attacks, as discussed, relies on the predictability of codes in keyless entry systems.

Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information.

This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed.

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

The text discusses how traditional UNIX file permissions do not provide the necessary granularity for modern systems. It highlights the problem of allowing a web server to view the contents of a user's home directory without compromising security.\n\nThe context also introduces Linux ACLs (Access Control Lists) as a solution to this problem. Linux ACLs allow for fine-tuned control over access to files and directories. The text demonstrates the use of the `setfacl` and `getfacl` commands to adjust Linux ACLs.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nImplicit assumptions in the text include the idea that traditional UNIX file permissions are insufficient for modern systems and that Linux ACLs are a more suitable solution. The text also assumes that the reader is familiar with basic UNIX file permissions and commands.\n\nThe text explores the concept of fine-grained control over file and directory access, highlighting the limitations of traditional UNIX file permissions. It also touches on the idea of access control lists and their application in Linux systems.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI would rate the difficulty level of the provided context as a 6 out of 10. The text assumes a basic understanding of UNIX file permissions and commands, but it also introduces more advanced concepts like Linux ACLs.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nThe question should encourage a deep understanding of the concept of Linux ACLs and their application in modern systems. It should also require the reader to critically evaluate the limitations of traditional UNIX file permissions and the benefits of using Linux ACLs.\n\n## </document_analysis>\n\n## <output_format>\n\nQuestion: What is the primary advantage of using Linux ACLs over traditional UNIX file permissions in modern systems?\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that Linux ACLs provide a more granular permission system, allowing for fine-tuned control over access to files and directories.\n\nCorrect Answer: Linux ACLs provide a more granular permission system, allowing for fine-tuned control over access to files and directories.\n\n</output_format>",

The Dockerfile is used to build the image, which includes copying the shell.php file into the container. This allows the shell to be executed and potentially used for malicious activities.\n\n### Concept Exploration\nThe concept of a Dockerfile is explored in the context of security and deployment. The file is used to define the build process for the Docker image, which includes copying files and setting up the environment. However, in this scenario, the Dockerfile is used to deploy malicious software, highlighting the potential risks of trusting the build process.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\nDifficulty rating: 8/10\n\nThe question requires an understanding of Dockerfiles and their role in deployment, as well as the concept of malicious software. The answer requires a nuanced understanding of how the Dockerfile is used to deploy the shell.php file and its potential consequences.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\nThe question is designed to test the domain expert's understanding of the Dockerfile and its role in deployment, as well as their ability to analyze the potential risks and consequences of deploying malicious software.\n\n### Identification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information\nIrrelevant elements: The callout-list and aside content are ignored as they are not relevant to the analysis.\n\nBogus information: None detected.\n\n### Decision Criteria for Question Generation\nMeaningful content requirement: The provided context contains meaningful, coherent, and educationally valuable content.\n\nComplete irrelevance: The entire context does not consist exclusively of irrelevant or promotional content.\n\n### Documentation in Analysis\nRationale for exclusion of irrelevant information: The callout-list and aside content are ignored as they are not relevant to the analysis.\n\nJustification for question generation: The provided context contains meaningful, coherent, and educationally valuable content that can be used to generate a question that tests the domain expert's understanding of the Dockerfile and its role in deployment.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the role of the Dockerfile in the deployment of the malicious software within the Docker container?\nExplanation: The Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image, which includes copying the shell.php file into the container, allowing it to be executed and potentially used for malicious activities.\nCorrect Answer: The Dockerfile defines the build process for the Docker image, including copying files and setting up the environment, which in this scenario is used to deploy malicious software.\n</output_format>",

Tokenization {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tokenization}\nTokenization may be used as part of an access control scheme to protect sensitive information. Information that would be\n\nhighly valuable if compromised is replaced with a random token known to the parties involved in the transaction. In a\n\ntypically scenario once the tokens have been established, only the token is sent out over an untrusted network.\n\nImagine you don't want your credit card number exposed to merchants. One solution would be if you used a payment service\n\nthat issued you a new credit card number for each transaction. This credit card number would only be valid for a single\n\ntransaction and would be billed to your regular credit card (which the payment service would have access to). In this\n\ncase the token is the one-time-use credit card number and the sensitive information is your actual credit card number.\n\nPayment services like ApplePay and GoogleWallet do exactly this.\n\n:::\n\n:::::::::::::::::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"7.4. Lab: Linux File Permissions\"}\n\n\n## 7.4. Lab: Linux File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_linux_file_permissions}\nIn this lab we are going to explore UNIX style file permissions and determine what they can do and why they are limited.\n\nFinally we will see how Linux ACLs provide more flexibility in assigning permissions.\n\nWe will be working in a vanilla Ubuntu container and installing software and adding users manually. Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to.

In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them.

A forward proxy passes requests from a private\n\nor internal network to the internet. Forward proxies can speed up local requests through caching and validate that the\n\nrequest should be performed. Forward proxies are interoperable with standard firewalls and network address translation\n\n(NAT).\n\nReverse proxies take requests from an external source and pass it to an internal service. This helps prevent clients\n\nfrom having direct access to internal services. Reverse proxies can utilize caching and validate requests as well. A\n\nreverse proxy can also be configured to work with a firewall.

This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

SSH Keys\"}\n\n\n### 7.3.7. SSH Keys {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ssh_keys}\nSecure Shell Server (SSH) supports the use of asymmetric encryption keys for authentication. Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data. This bit of data is useless to the MitM.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.8. Sessions and Cookies\"}\n",

By retaining\n\nrecords for 90 days, tracking changes, and requiring public disclosure, SOX makes it harder for corporations to commit\n\nfraud.\n\nThe Gram-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is another act designed to protect CIA and provide more information for the customer.\n\nThe GLBA mandates that a financial institution must explain what they do with customer information, offer the customer\n\nthe right to opt-out, and make sure the vendors they work with are in compliance.\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.2.6.

TGTs are the cornerstone\n\nof Kerberos security and the Golden Ticket exploit targets them specifically.\n\nUsing the fully qualified domain name, security identifier, username of an account, and a KRBTGT password hash an\n\nattacker can create their own TGTs that will grant access to services. The KRBTGT account is an account that Windows\n\nmachines use to perform Kerberos administrative tasks. The KRBTGT password hash can be obtained from any machine where\n\nthat account was used if the attacker has complete access to the files on the hard drive. This may be done with physical\n\naccess or through the use of malware on a victim machine.\n\nAn attacker will only be able to forge TGTs until the KRBTGT account password is changed, [so a common remediation\n\nstrategy is to change the\n\npassword](https://blog.quest.com/what-is-krbtgt-and-why-should-you-change-the-password/){.link}.

PHI/HIPPA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__phihippa}\nProtected Health Information (PHI) is another type of protected data covered by various legal and industry standards.\n\nPHI may be a medical history, admissions information for medical facilities, prescription information, or health\n\ninsurance data.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides standards for how PHI should be handled. In\n\naccordance with HIPAA PHI can only be disclosed to certain parties, users have a right to see and correct PHI, and PHI\n\nmust be securely stored and transmitted.\n\nIf you've ever wondered why your health care provider always sends you to a secure portal instead of emailing you the\n\ndetails of your visit, it is because they are dealing with PHI and email is not considered secure.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.2.5.

SOX/GLBA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__soxglba}\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was passed following the busting of the dotcom bubble to help combat financial fraud. SOX\n\ndetails some basic CIA measures (as do most regulations):\n\n::: description-list\n\n[Confidentiality]{.term}\n\n:   [encryption, data loss prevention]{.principal}\n\n[Integrity]{.term}\n\n:   [access control, logging]{.principal}\n\n[Accessibility]{.term}\n\n:   [data retention, audits, public disclosure of breaches]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThe interesting thing is that these controls also make it harder for a company to lie about its dealings. By retaining\n\nrecords for 90 days, tracking changes, and requiring public disclosure, SOX makes it harder for corporations to commit\n\nfraud.\n\nThe Gram-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is another act designed to protect CIA and provide more information for the customer.\n\nThe GLBA mandates that a financial institution must explain what they do with customer information, offer the customer\n\nthe right to opt-out, and make sure the vendors they work with are in compliance.\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.2.6.

Through the shell you can create, read, update, or delete files, make network\n\nconnections, configure kernel parameters, install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells that\n\ncan be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an\n\nattacker would need to have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is being able to interact\n\nwith a shell remotely on the exploited machine.\n\nIn this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect. In these instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out\n\nfrom the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the inside*. This is more compatible with the\n\nfirewalls/NAT routers that sit between most devices and the Internet.\n\nIn either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote connection allows an attacker to basically do\n\nanything they want. To that end, many tools have sprung up to provide remote shell access. A machine may already have a\n\nremote shell tool installed, such as an SSH server. Barring that [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/){.link} can be\n\nused with any executable to provide access to it over a network.

Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

    "context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1. CVEs\"}\n",

They could gain a lot of traffic from people who mistyped google.\n\nThese sites could be used for ad revenue, phishing credentials, or even possibly to distribute malware. A mitigation\n\nthat several browsers implement is to keep a list of malicious websites and warn users before they visit them.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.5.10. Domain Hijacking\"}\n</context>\n<question_topic>What are the differences between URL Hijacking and Typosquating, and how do they relate to each other?</question_topic>\n\n<document_analysis>\n\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nThe given context discusses two types of attacks: Directory Traversal and URL Hijacking/Typosquating. Directory Traversal is a type of attack where an attacker submits a malicious HTTP request that tricks the web server into serving sensitive files. URL Hijacking/Typosquating, on the other hand, involves registering a domain name that is similar to a popular domain name, with the intention of deceiving users who mistype the popular domain.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nImplicit assumptions in this context include the importance of proper web server configuration, file permissions, and access controls to prevent directory traversal attacks. Additionally, the concept of URL encoding and sanitizing incoming requests is explored to prevent malicious inputs. The underlying theory behind URL hijacking/typosquating involves exploiting human error and psychological factors to deceive users into visiting malicious websites.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI would rate the difficulty of this question as a 9 out of 10, as it requires a deep understanding of web security concepts, including directory traversal attacks and URL hijacking/typosquating.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nThis question aims to encourage critical thinking and analysis of the differences between these two types of attacks. It requires the test-taker to understand the underlying principles and concepts behind each attack, as well as their relationships to each other.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\n\nQuestion: What are the primary differences between URL Hijacking and Typosquating, and how do they exploit user behavior to achieve malicious goals?\n\nExplanation: This question requires the test-taker to understand the nuances between URL Hijacking and Typosquating, including their respective attack vectors and the psychological factors that contribute to their success.\n\nCorrect Answer: URL Hijacking involves exploiting human error through domain name typos, while Typosquating involves registering a domain name that is similar to a popular domain name to deceive users. Both attacks exploit user behavior to achieve malicious goals, but they differ in their approach and attack vector.\n\n</output_format>",

Learning the Lingo {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__learning_the_lingo}\nIn general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary. Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2. AAA\"}\n",

The example of an e-commerce site storing credit card numbers is used to illustrate the importance of integrity.\n\n**Concept Exploration**\n\nImplicit assumptions in this section include the importance of data reliability and trust in a system. The underlying theory is that data integrity is crucial for maintaining the trustworthiness of a system, and any violation of integrity can lead to significant consequences. Potential applications of this concept include ensuring the reliability of financial transactions, protecting sensitive information, and preventing data tampering.\n\n**Strategic Complexity Calibration**\n\nI rate the difficulty of this concept as 8 out of 10, as it requires a deep understanding of information security principles and their implications.\n\n**Intentional Question Planning**\n\nThe question invites deeper understanding of the concept of integrity in security and its relation to data reliability and trust.
