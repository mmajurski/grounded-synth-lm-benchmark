The Knicks\u2013Nuggets brawl was noted as the most penalized on-court fight in the NBA since the Pacers\u2013Pistons brawl.\n\nUpon examining the context, I identified that the central idea revolves around these two brawls and their impact on NBA history. The context highlights the severity and the aftermath of both incidents, with specific details about their dates and locations.
