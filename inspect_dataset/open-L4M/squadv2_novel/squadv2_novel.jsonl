Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid. Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease.",

The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.

The context further reveals that Abdul Karim's background was investigated, and it was found that he had lied about his parentage.\n\nTo craft a challenging question, we need to delve deeper into the implications of Abdul Karim's appointment and his role in the Queen's court. The question should encourage reflection on the significance of Abdul Karim's influence and the reactions it provoked.\n\nUpon examining the context, it becomes clear that Abdul Karim's appointment was not just a simple matter of hiring a new servant but had significant social and political implications.

It also highlights that the event included traditional media availabilities and an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe central idea here is the change in the timing and format of the media day event. To generate a question that probes domain expert knowledge about the potential impact of this change, I considered the implications of moving the event to Monday evening. This involves thinking about how such a change could affect media coverage and audience engagement.\n\nKey considerations include:\n1. How might the change in timing from Tuesday afternoon to Monday evening affect the media's ability to cover the event and subsequently report on it?\n2. How could this change influence audience engagement, considering factors like viewer ratings, social media buzz, and overall public interest?\n\nGiven these considerations, I aim to craft a question that encourages reflection on the strategic decision to re-time the event and its potential outcomes.\n\nThe context provided is meaningful and contains relevant details about the event's rebranding and timing change.

    "context": "Multiracial Americans are Americans who have mixed ancestry of \"two or more races\". The term may also include Americans of mixed-race ancestry who self-identify with just one group culturally and socially (cf. the one-drop rule). In the 2010 US census, approximately 9 million individuals, or 2.9% of the population, self-identified as multiracial. There is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number, but people live according to social and cultural identities, not DNA. Historical reasons, including slavery creating a racial caste and the European-American suppression of Native Americans, often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity, generally that of the culture in which they were raised. Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities. While many Americans may be biologically multiracial, they often do not know it or do not identify so culturally, any more than they maintain all the differing traditions of a variety of national ancestries.",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a question that meets the high standards outlined, let's first analyze the given context. The context discusses multiracial Americans, their definition, and the factors influencing their self-identification. It highlights historical reasons such as slavery and the suppression of Native Americans, which led to the practice of identifying with a single ethnicity. Additionally, it touches upon the impact of racial discrimination on the self-identification of multiracial individuals.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context provides a comprehensive overview of multiracial Americans, including their numbers according to the 2010 US census and the potential discrepancy between self-identification and genetic ancestry. It also delves into historical and social factors that have influenced how multiracial individuals identify themselves.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The implicit assumptions in the context include the understanding that social and cultural identities are more significant than genetic ancestry in determining how individuals identify themselves racially. The subtle detail here is the distinction between biological multiracialism and cultural identification. The underlying theory is that societal pressures and historical contexts play a crucial role in shaping racial identity.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: Given the nuanced discussion around the factors influencing the self-identification of multiracial individuals, a question that probes this complexity would be rated high in terms of difficulty, likely an 8 or 9 out of 10. This is because it requires not just a recall of facts but an understanding of the underlying social dynamics and historical contexts.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: The question should invite a deeper understanding of how racial discrimination and historical factors have impacted the self-identification of multiracial individuals. It should encourage reflection on the implications of these factors on personal and cultural identity.\n\nGiven the context and the topic provided, the analysis leads to the formulation of a question that is both challenging and insightful, requiring a deep engagement with the content.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How did historical racial discrimination influence the self-identification practices of multiracial individuals in America, and what are the ongoing implications of this influence?\nExplanation: The correct answer should reflect an understanding that historical racial discrimination led many multiracial individuals to hide their multiracial heritage or identify with a single ethnicity, typically the dominant culture they were raised in.

    "context": "In 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.",

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \"Munshi\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice. Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension on her death.",

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism.

    "context": "Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.",

Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. \"Everyone likes flattery,\" he said, \"and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" With the phrase \"we authors, Ma'am\", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister.

    "context": "In 1870, republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a question related to the topic \"The effect of Queen Victoria's illness in 1871 on her public role and republican sentiment,\" we need to analyze the given context carefully. The context mentions that Queen Victoria was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm in August and September 1871. It also discusses the republican sentiment in Britain during that period, which was boosted by her seclusion and other factors like the establishment of the Third French Republic.\n\nUpon examining the context, it becomes clear that the direct impact of Queen Victoria's illness on her public role and republican sentiment is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that her illness, followed by her son's typhoid fever and subsequent recovery, had significant implications for her public appearances and the prevailing republican sentiment.\n\nThe context highlights that during the height of the republican movement in late November 1871, the Prince of Wales's condition was a major concern, and his recovery led to a public parade and a grand service of thanksgiving, after which republican feeling subsided. While Queen Victoria's illness is mentioned, its direct effect on republican sentiment is not explicitly linked. Instead, the narrative focuses on the Prince of Wales's illness and recovery as a turning point for public sentiment.\n\nTo create a challenging question, we need to explore the implicit connections and the broader context. The question should probe the domain expert's understanding of the period, the factors influencing republican sentiment, and the role of the monarchy's public perception.\n\nThought Process:\n1. Identify the key elements: Queen Victoria's illness, republican sentiment, and the Prince of Wales's typhoid fever.\n2. Analyze the connections: The context implies that public perception and events influenced republican sentiment.\n3.

The correct answer should reflect that the recovery of the Prince of Wales was a significant factor in shifting public sentiment away from republicanism, as evidenced by the public parade and thanksgiving service.\nCorrect Answer: The recovery of the Prince of Wales improved public perception and diminished republican sentiment.\n</output_format>",
