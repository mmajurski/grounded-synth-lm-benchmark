Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) propose encrypting test data with a public key and a \u201cNo Derivatives\u201d license to block automated crawling and reuse. Yang et\u00a0al. (2023) show that even advanced decontamination methods can be defeated by minor text variations, emphasizing the need for robust encryption. Similarly, TRUCE (Chandran et\u00a0al., 2024) leverages confidential computing and secure multi-party computation to enable private benchmarking, ensuring that test data and model parameters remain confidential.\n\n\n###### Limitation\nWhile these methods effectively protect against data leakage, they depend on strong key management, they introduce extra computational overheads. These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment. This approach is common in benchmarks such as GLUE Wang (2018), SuperGLUE Wang et\u00a0al. (2019), and OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Chen et\u00a0al. (2021), etc., where the test labels are withheld to prevent models from learning or memorizing them during training.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe provided context discusses methods for securing evaluation data, primarily focusing on encryption and label protection. Encryption is detailed as a mechanism to make evaluation data inaccessible to unauthorized parties, with examples including public key encryption and confidential computing. There is mention of the need to prevent accidental inclusion of evaluation data in training sets and automated reuse, highlighting both technical and procedural aspects. Limitations are addressed, emphasizing key management and the risk of compromised encryption. Label protection is also described as a method to keep test labels secret, thus preserving evaluation integrity and preventing models from being exposed to correct answers during training.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the text assumes that model contamination from exposure to evaluation data is a major threat to research integrity. There is an underlying theory that technical solutions (encryption, confidential computing) and procedural controls (label withholding) together form a robust defense. The mention of public key encryption, \u201cNo Derivatives\u201d licenses, and secure multi-party computation implies a blend of cryptographic and legal measures.

To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to enhance static benchmarking and mitigate the impact of data contamination.\n\n\n##### 3.3.1 Canary String\nCanary strings are deliberately crafted, unique tokens embedded within a dataset to serve as markers for data contamination. When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\n###### Limitations\nThe effectiveness of canary strings depends on model trainers being aware of and responsive to these markers.\n\nIf a developer aims to leak benchmarking data to boost scores, this method will not work.\n",

Canary strings are introduced as a detection method: unique tokens embedded to signal data leakage if models output them. However, their effectiveness is limited by the need for model trainers to actively monitor for them and by the possibility of intentional misuse (e.g., developers intentionally leaking data to inflate model benchmarks). The central tension lies between automatic detection mechanisms and the human/ethical dimension of model training and evaluation.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the text highlights ethical responsibilities of model trainers\u2014recognizing contamination, actively responding to detection signals, and resisting the temptation to inflate scores. It also raises practical issues: the dependence on vigilance, the limitations of detection if actors are uncooperative or malicious, and the inherent vulnerability of public datasets.

These challenges can undermine the reliability of LLM evaluations by allowing contaminated models to go undetected or by incentivizing manipulation of benchmarks.\n\nCorrect Answer: The effectiveness of canary strings is limited by ethical challenges like intentional data leakage and lack of trainer vigilance, and by practical issues such as dependence on trainers to monitor and act on contamination signals, both of which can compromise the validity of LLM evaluations.\n</output_format>",

Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed.

(2024))\u2014which increases the risk of evaluation data overlap. In the post-training phase, models are further fine-tuned on large human-annotated\u00a0Mukherjee et\u00a0al. (2023); Kim et\u00a0al.

Although retrieval-based detection methods\u00a0Team et\u00a0al. (2024); Achiam et\u00a0al.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses the challenge of \"contamination\" in large language models (LLMs), specifically how their training and evaluation data may overlap due to the massive, indiscriminately sourced datasets used for pretraining. This risk is further heightened during post-training, when models are fine-tuned on large human-annotated or synthetic datasets that may mimic evaluation benchmarks. The text highlights that, unlike traditional models, LLMs\u2019 training data boundaries are blurred, increasing the possibility that evaluation data or its near-duplicates are inadvertently included in training. Additionally, the proprietary nature of many LLMs\u2019 training corpora makes it difficult to audit or mitigate such contamination.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe implicit assumption is that fine-tuning on datasets similar to evaluation tasks could lead to models performing well on benchmarks not because of true generalization, but due to memorization or overfitting. The underlying theory is that without clear separation and transparency, the validity of reported model performance becomes questionable. The compounded risk arises because both the initial pretraining and the subsequent fine-tuning stages independently introduce possible contamination, and together, they may amplify the effect.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nThis topic is highly nuanced and technical, involving deep understanding of machine learning evaluation, overfitting, and the unique risks posed by LLM development pipelines.

This contamination undermines the reliability of benchmark results, as high performance may reflect data leakage rather than genuine model capability, and the proprietary nature of training data further obscures the ability to detect or mitigate this risk.\n\nCorrect Answer: It increases the chance of memorization and overestimation of model performance, thereby compromising the validity and trustworthiness of benchmark evaluations.\n</output_format>",

Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses limitations in label protection, particularly regarding transparency and reproducibility due to reliance on centralized evaluation systems. The main focus, however, is on \"post-hoc detection\" methods to identify data contamination between training and test datasets. Traditional n-gram overlap methods are said to be insufficient due to their susceptibility to false negatives, leading to the adoption of more robust approaches such as embedding-based similarity and advanced mapping metrics.\n\nCrucially, the text emphasizes behavioral analyses that go beyond direct textual overlap\u2014specifically, assessing model behavior with masked inputs, partial completions, and preference for original versus paraphrased test cases. These strategies help reveal memorization and subtle contamination that may not be detectable via surface-level similarity alone. The example of CONSTAT, a method comparing model performance across benchmarks, is mentioned as an approach for detecting contamination.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe implicit assumption is that models can memorize data in ways that evade detection by simple string matching. Therefore, behavioral approaches\u2014like observing responses to masked inputs or paraphrased prompts\u2014offer a window into latent memorization. The referenced methods highlight the importance of evaluating not just input-output overlap, but also the functional consequences on model performance when test data is manipulated. This brings forth the challenge of distinguishing genuine generalization from memorization-driven performance, especially when contamination is subtle.\n\n3.

The central idea is that scalability quantifies how efficiently a dynamic benchmark method can produce more data relative to the resources expended (costs).

Specifically, it is the ratio of the size of a transformed dataset to the original dataset, normalized by the cost incurred for the transformation.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in this discussion is the assumption that larger datasets are preferable for statistical robustness, but data generation is not free\u2014costs must be accounted for.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

(2023) to use both encryption and a \"No Derivatives\" license. The \"No Derivatives\" license is intended as a legal mechanism to prevent data reuse or modification, which, when combined with encryption, provides both technical and legal barriers. The text further mentions that even sophisticated decontamination approaches can be circumvented by minor modifications, illustrating the persistent risk of data leakage and the necessity for strong protective measures. The TRUCE system is mentioned as employing confidential computing and secure multi-party computation for private benchmarking, further emphasizing privacy and security. The limitation section points out that these encryption-based methods are only as strong as their key management and can be undermined if the keys are compromised.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe combination of public key encryption and restrictive licensing is designed to address both technical and non-technical vectors for data leakage or misuse. Implicit is the assumption that automated crawlers and unauthorized users could both technically access test data and legally misuse it if not protected on both fronts. It also suggests that legal restrictions alone are insufficient without technical enforcement, and vice versa.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n",

The conclusion calls for further standardization and practical tools in dynamic evaluation, while the limitations section acknowledges the survey\u2019s high-level focus and the evolving nature of the field, emphasizing the need for refinement and validation of dynamic benchmarking criteria.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the text assumes that the rapid evolution of LLMs and their evaluation methods introduces uncertainty in benchmarking outcomes, especially for dynamic approaches. The underlying challenge is achieving both reliability (consistent results over time or across evaluators) and reproducibility (independent parties obtaining the same results under equivalent conditions) in a landscape where benchmarks and methods are not yet standardized or fully developed.

This complication is exacerbated by the preliminary state of dynamic benchmarking criteria and the absence of widely validated practical tools, impeding both reliability and reproducibility and therefore hindering standardization efforts.\n\nCorrect Answer: Dynamic benchmarking lacks standardized, validated procedures, leading to inconsistent and irreproducible results, which complicates efforts to establish reliable and standardized evaluation practices.\n</output_format>",

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

The central issue addressed is the tension between transparent, public benchmarks and the risk that such benchmarks, if leaked or used in training, could compromise their validity for evaluating LLMs. Collision is introduced as a key concept, with specific metrics (Collision Rate and Repeat Trials) designed to measure how much overlap exists between independent transformations of a benchmark dataset. This directly impacts the benchmark's ability to generate novel, uncontaminated test cases.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the text assumes that minimizing overlap (collision) between independently generated datasets is desirable, as higher overlap could mean LLMs are evaluated on data they have effectively \"seen\" before, reducing the validity of the benchmark. Collision Rate, as defined, is a quantifiable measure of this overlap, reflecting the risk of contamination and the effectiveness of the dynamic benchmark at maintaining novelty.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

    "context": "### Ethical Considerations\nOur work is rooted in the goal of enhancing the transparency and fairness of LLM evaluations, which can help mitigate the risks of bias and contamination in AI systems. However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains. Lastly, we encourage further exploration of ethical guidelines surrounding data usage, model transparency, and the broader societal impact of AI benchmarks.\n",

These benchmarks cover a broad range of tasks including math, language, coding, reasoning, knowledge, safety, instruction following, and reading comprehension. They serve as standardized evaluation tools to measure model abilities in areas such as arithmetic problem-solving, natural language understanding, program synthesis, commonsense reasoning, factual knowledge retrieval, toxicity detection, and more. Table\u00a02 provides an overview of these benchmarks along with the corresponding task categories and key references.\n\n\n#### 3.1 Problem Formulation\nA static benchmark is given by\n\n\ud835\udc9f=(\ud835\udcb3,\ud835\udcb4,\ud835\udcae(.))\\mathcal{D}=(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{Y},\\mathcal{S}(.))caligraphic\\_D = ( caligraphic\\_X , caligraphic\\_Y , caligraphic\\_S ( . ) ),\n\nwhere \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc9f\\mathcal{D}caligraphic\\_D represents the seed dataset, consisting of input prompts \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\mathcal{X}caligraphic\\_X, expected outputs \ud835\udcb4\ud835\udcb4\\mathcal{Y}caligraphic\\_Y, and a scoring function \ud835\udcae\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udcae\u22c5\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_S ( \u22c5 ) that evaluates the quality of an LLM\u2019s outputs by comparing them against \ud835\udcb4\ud835\udcb4\\mathcal{Y}caligraphic\\_Y.\n",

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses static benchmarks as standardized tools to evaluate diverse aspects of model performance (math, language, reasoning, etc.). The core structure of a static benchmark is formalized as a triplet (\ud835\udcb3, \ud835\udcb4, \ud835\udcae(.)), where \ud835\udcb3 is the set of input prompts, \ud835\udcb4 is the set of expected outputs, and \ud835\udcae(.) is the scoring function comparing model outputs to \ud835\udcb4. The benchmarks are static in nature, relying on predetermined datasets and comparison metrics.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit assumptions include that the selected inputs and expected outputs comprehensively represent the capabilities being tested and that the scoring function is sufficiently robust to capture quality differences. Limitations may arise if the static dataset does not account for the full generalization capacity of LLMs or fails to adapt to model evolution.

These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment. This approach is common in benchmarks such as GLUE Wang (2018), SuperGLUE Wang et\u00a0al. (2019), and OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Chen et\u00a0al.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context details two primary methods for securing evaluation data in machine learning: encryption and label protection. Encryption secures both the data and, potentially, associated labels through cryptographic means, making the data inaccessible to unauthorized users and protecting against inclusion in training data. It also introduces methods like confidential computing and secure multi-party computation for private benchmarking. However, encryption requires strong key management and is vulnerable if keys are compromised, and also incurs computational overhead. Label protection, on the other hand, keeps the answers to test sets hidden, allowing only authorized evaluators access, and is commonly used in standard benchmarks to prevent contamination of models through exposure to true answers. Its strength lies in maintaining evaluation integrity, but it does not necessarily protect the test data itself from exposure, only the labels.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nUnderlying these methods is the assumption that data contamination\u2014whereby evaluation data is inadvertently used in training\u2014undermines benchmark integrity. Encryption addresses this by securing the data itself, while label protection focuses on hiding the answers.

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

It highlights that the problem is exacerbated by the opacity of LLM training data, driven by privacy and commercial confidentiality, making it nearly impossible to audit training corpora for the presence of benchmark items.

The graph-based approach is exemplified by frameworks such as DyVal, NPHardEval, and another by Xie et al. DyVal, in particular, focuses on randomly generated directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and evaluates LLMs by asking them to deduce the value of the root node based on a natural language description of the DAG, which is generated through rule-based conversion. The difficulty of the reasoning task is explicitly controlled by varying the number of nodes and edges in the DAG. This introduces a principled way to adjust task complexity and systematically probe LLM reasoning.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, DyVal leverages the structure of DAGs to encode dependency chains and hierarchical relationships among nodes, mimicking complex reasoning processes. By randomizing the DAG generation and controlling their complexity, the evaluation isolates the model's ability to handle increasingly intricate dependency resolutions rather than memorized patterns. The conversion of DAGs into natural language ensures the task assesses not only logical reasoning but also the LLM\u2019s ability to parse and process language-based representations of structured data.\n\n3.

The central idea is to mitigate issues of data contamination and sample diversity by using LLMs to generate new benchmark samples.

Concept Exploration:\nAuto-Dataset\u2019s methodology implicitly assumes that LLMs can capture and reproduce both the style and knowledge content of existing benchmarks, which is non-trivial given the complexity of natural language and domain knowledge. Additionally, generating related questions at various cognitive levels requires an understanding of Bloom\u2019s taxonomy and the ability to synthesize or transform questions to target different depths of reasoning or recall. This dual approach potentially addresses both the need for stylistic authenticity in benchmarks and the need for cognitive variety, which can enhance the robustness of benchmark evaluations.

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

(2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74).

This contamination leads to artificially inflated evaluation metrics, undermining the validity of benchmark results.

The discussion emphasizes two main insights: (a) the growing ineffectiveness of static benchmarks as training data increases, making contamination more likely, and (b) the insufficiency of traditional static approaches, leading to the need for dynamic, adaptive benchmarks. However, it is noted that dynamic benchmarks themselves currently lack standardized evaluation criteria, and issues such as scalability, complexity control, and transparency persist.\n\n2.

Two metrics are proposed: Collision Rate (quantifying overlap between two transformed datasets) and Repeat Trials (quantifying the number of transformation trials required to fully regenerate an existing transformed dataset). The implication is that higher Repeat Trials implies a greater capacity for novelty and diversity, which in turn ensures the robustness and ongoing utility of the benchmark.\n\n2.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses two main themes: (a) the limitations of post-hot detection methods in identifying data contamination within large language models (LLMs), focusing especially on the difficulties arising from restricted access to training datasets due to legal and privacy constraints; and (b) the concept and formalism of dynamic benchmarking as a response to the limitations of static benchmarks, outlining how dynamic datasets are derived through transformation functions to avoid contamination.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nA key implicit assumption is that post-hot detection methods rely on being able to compare evaluation datasets with training data to identify contamination (i.e., overlap). However, legal and privacy restrictions often prevent full or even partial access to the training data, making such overlap detection infeasible or unreliable. Additionally, the text notes that behavioral assumptions (e.g., that contaminated data will elicit lower perplexity or higher memorization from the model) may not universally apply, adding further complexity and uncertainty. These constraints have significant ramifications for the reliability and generalizability of post-hot detection, and by extension, for the evaluation and trustworthiness of LLMs. The introduction of dynamic benchmarking can be seen as an attempt to mitigate these contamination risks by continually transforming datasets, but its efficacy is also bounded by the initial seed data and transformation design.\n\n3.

This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making.

Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the text assumes that LLMs can exploit syntactic similarities for decision-making, especially in tasks where syntax is crucial. The nuance is that even minor syntactic variations may not suffice for genuine novelty in test data, thus risking contamination. The underlying theory is that NLP models may perform well not because of genuine understanding but due to overlapping syntactic patterns between training and test data. Applications relying on syntax (e.g., parsing, part-of-speech tagging) are particularly susceptible to this pitfall.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

Ignoring such contamination risks inflating model performance by evaluating it on data that is not truly novel, thus undermining the reliability and validity of benchmarks.\n\nCorrect Answer: Because syntactic applications may rely on surface-level patterns, treating syntactic transformations as contamination prevents models from exploiting memorized structures, ensuring benchmarks accurately assess generalization and avoiding overestimated performance.\n</output_format>",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context focuses on the concept of \"temporal cutoff\" in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs), specifically the practice of constructing benchmarks using data gathered after a model's knowledge cutoff date. This is intended to reduce data contamination, ensuring that models are assessed on information they could not possibly have seen during training. Several benchmarks\u2014LiveBench, AntiLeak-Bench, AcademicEval, LiveCodeBench, LiveAoPSBench, and Forecastbench\u2014are cited as implementing this strategy, each sourcing or generating evaluation data from time periods or domains guaranteed to postdate the model's last update.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe underlying assumption is that if evaluation data predates the model's training data, there is a risk that the model may have been exposed to it, leading to artificially inflated performance (\"data contamination\"). By using post-cutoff data, benchmarks can more accurately measure a model's reasoning, generalization, and adaptability to new, unseen information. This strategy strengthens both the reliability (consistency and trustworthiness of the benchmark results) and the validity (the extent to which the benchmark measures what it purports to measure) of evaluations. Implicitly, this approach also allows for continuous updates and the maintenance of benchmarks that remain relevant as knowledge evolves.\n\n3.

However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.
