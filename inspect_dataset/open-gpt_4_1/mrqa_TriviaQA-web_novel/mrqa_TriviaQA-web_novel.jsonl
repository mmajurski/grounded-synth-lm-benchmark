    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit). However, in Italy Mario Monti declared Italian Lira banknotes unredeemable for euros some months before the regular expiration of the 10-year term, and this is also true when the banknotes were lost before and then are found after",
    "topic": "The legal and practical circumstances under which legal tender may be lawfully refused, with reference to the absence of pre-existing debt and the concept of invitation to treat.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context provides a detailed exploration of the concept of legal tender, emphasizing its definition, application, and exceptions in law and practice. It explains that legal tender is a medium recognized by law for settling debts, typically paper currency and coins, and that non-cash payment methods are usually not legal tender. A crucial nuance is that the obligation to accept legal tender generally arises only when a debt exists prior to the offer of payment. The text highlights practical scenarios (e.g., vending machines, shopkeepers, restaurants) illustrating when legal tender may lawfully be refused, invoking the legal doctrine of \"invitation to treat.\" It further discusses how traders are not obliged to engage in transactions, and that the legal tender status becomes relevant primarily for discharging existing debts.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nUnderlying this discussion is the legal principle distinguishing between the creation of an obligation (debt) and the offer to pay (tender). The \"invitation to treat\" concept clarifies that offers to buy goods (e.g., presenting cash at a shop) do not compel acceptance, as no debt exists until the transaction is agreed. Thus, legal tender laws do not force private parties to transact but only prescribe how existing debts may be extinguished. This distinction has practical implications for commerce and contract law, particularly regarding when and how payment must be accepted.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. The question will require understanding the intersection of contract law (invitation to treat), legal tender statutes, and practical business conduct, integrating both theoretical and applied legal reasoning.\n\n4. Intentional Question Planning:\nTo probe expert knowledge, the question will require analysis of when legal tender must be accepted, the legal mechanisms allowing refusal, and the relevance of pre-existing debt and invitation to treat. The question should challenge the expert to synthesize legal definitions with practical commercial examples and legal doctrines, avoiding surface-level or purely definitional responses.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Under what legal and practical circumstances can an entity lawfully refuse to accept legal tender, and how do the absence of a pre-existing debt and the doctrine of invitation to treat interact to permit such refusal, particularly in the context of everyday transactions like retail sales or vending machine purchases?\n\nExplanation: The correct answer requires integrating the concept that legal tender is only mandatory for settling pre-existing debts, not for offers to contract where no debt has yet arisen. The doctrine of invitation to treat clarifies that advertisements or displays of goods are invitations for offers, not binding offers themselves; thus, retailers or service providers are not obliged to accept legal tender unless a debt has already been incurred (e.g., after a meal in a restaurant). In practical terms, businesses such as shops, vending machines, or transport staff can refuse certain denominations or any cash if no prior obligation exists, as the customer's offer to purchase does not create a debt until accepted.\n\nCorrect Answer: Legal tender may be lawfully refused when no pre-existing debt exists, as in retail sales or vending transactions, because the invitation to treat allows sellers to decline offers of payment until a contract is formed.\n</output_format>",

[PAR] Fact One [PAR] Fantasia was Walt Disney's third feature film, following on from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940) [PAR] Fact Two [PAR] The Sorcerer's Apprentice, perhaps the most famous short of the film Fantasia, starred Mickey Mouse as the, er, Sorcerer's Apprentice. This role was intended as a come-back role for Disney's famous mouse, who was losing out in popularity to Donald Duck. However, also considered for the role of the apprentice was Dopey from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The animation itself was also originally going to be a one-off cartoon, but since it was more expensive to produce than regular Disney cartoons and was unlikely to make any profit, Disney decided to make it part of a collection of animated sequences with classical music accompaniments which could then be released as a feature film. That collection of animated shorts would become Fantasia. [PAR] Fact Three [PAR] The conductor of the music used in Fantasia was Leopold Stokowski. When The Sorcerer's Apprentice was being worked on, Stokowski offered to conduct the orchestra for free. He probably changed his mind when he found out he would be conducting the orchestra for the entire film. [PAR] Fact Four [PAR] Live action sequences shown between the animated segments show an orchestra playing the soundtrack. In those scenes, the orchestra were miming! The music for all sequences apart from The Sorceror's Apprentice was played by Philadelphia Orchestra. In the film, members of the orchestra pretending to play to the pre-recorded music were local musicians and employees of the film studio. [PAR] Fact Five [PAR] The original release of Fantasia featured an intermission which was announced by the film's host, Deems Taylor. The members of the orchestra are seen leaving their seats while the curtains close, both on the film and in the movie theatre showing it. After the intermission, which would have lasted for fifteen minutes, the curtains in the theatre and on the film open and the orchestra are seen to return to their seats, and then have a bit of a jam session.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Six [PAR] Fantasia, which was essentially a way for Walt Disney to show off animation and sound techniques in films, was the first commercial film to have its soundtrack recorded in stereo. It was also planned that parts of it would be shown in widescreen and other parts to be in 3-D, and, to make the film a real treat for the senses, for perfumes to be sprayed into the theatre during the Nutcracker Suite sequence.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Seven [PAR] Nowadays, films are completed weeks, months or even years before they get their premiere. Fantasia however was completed four hours before premiering in New York City on November 13th 1940. The final scene to be produced was flown to New York on the day of the premiere and edited into the film in time for its first showing. [PAR] Fact Eight [PAR] Despite getting generally good reviews, Fantasia was only shown in twelve movie theatres on its first release due to Disney's distribution company RKO initially deciding not to distribute it. The meant that the film could not make a profit, and meant that the budget for Disney's next film, Dumbo, was quite low. The film got a national release a couple of years later, although heavily edited (from the original 125 runtime to 81 minutes) and in mono. Again it was a commercial failure. A release in 1956 restored the stereo soundtrack, although it was only on its release in 1969 that the film finally made a profit, due to its psychedelic nature being popular with the teenage and college student audiences of the time. Its soundtrack was completely rerecorded for a 1982 release. Even the host's introductions to each segment were dubbed over. A 1990 release used the original soundtrack which had been digitally remastered, and a release for 2000 saw several of the original",

This reflects a broader African trend where population is unevenly distributed, often concentrated in fertile, resource-rich, or historically significant regions rather than in the largest territories.

    "answer": "Population density and distribution in Africa are shaped more by environmental and historical factors than by country size, resulting in populous regions in smaller or less extensive countries and revealing no direct correlation between land area and population.",
    "explanation": "The answer must synthesize that the largest countries by area (such as Algeria, DRC, and Sudan) do not necessarily have the largest populations, with countries like Ethiopia (tenth in area) having a much higher population, and Nigeria (largest by population) not appearing in the top ten by area. This reflects a broader African trend where population is unevenly distributed, often concentrated in fertile, resource-rich, or historically significant regions rather than in the largest territories. The key insight is that Africa's demographic distribution is shaped more by environmental, historical, and socio-economic factors than by sheer land area, leading to regions of high density in relatively smaller countries.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit). However, in Italy Mario Monti declared Italian Lira banknotes unredeemable for euros some months before the regular expiration of the 10-year term, and this is also true when the banknotes were lost before and then are found after",

It gives particular attention to the circumstances under which legal tender must be accepted, exceptions to acceptance, and the concept of invitation to treat. The etymology section clarifies the meaning of \"legal tender.\" The most relevant section to the question topic is \"Demonetisation,\" which describes the process by which coins and banknotes lose their legal tender status, usually due to currency reforms or introduction of a new currency. The UK example is particularly detailed, outlining the phased approach to decimalisation, treatment of old coins, and policies for redeeming obsolete currency.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The context highlights complex issues arising from demonetisation, such as transitional arrangements (e.g., retaining certain coins for machine compatibility), the legal right of redemption, and the economic implications of old coins having higher bullion value than face value. It also touches on the discretion of governments to alter or end redemption periods, as seen with Italy\u2019s early cessation of Lira redemption.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Scotland during the Roman EmpireScotland during the Roman Empire refers to the protohistorical period during which the Roman Empire interacted with the area that is now Scotland, which was known to them as \"Caledonia\". Roman legions arrived around \u00a071, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \"Britain\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \"Albion\", Romans under Q.\u00a0Petillius Cerialis and Gn.\u00a0Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \"Mons Graupius\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. [PAR] The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held any Scottish land at all for about 80 years. Some Scottish historians such as Moffat go so far as to say Rome's presence was entirely uninfluential. \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti, Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast as well. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. [PAR] The dawn of Scottish history [PAR] Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. [PAR] The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \"very large\" British Isles called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285\u00a0 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).  [PAR] The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in \u00a043 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.   The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.  Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.   Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his De Chorographia, written around \u00a043, that there were 30 Orkney islands and seven Haemodae (possibly Shetland).Breeze, David J.",

It also details the historical ambiguity regarding the province of Valentia and the relatively brief Roman presence. Importantly, the text addresses the evolution of native groups: by the Roman withdrawal (~410), Iron Age tribes in Scotland had either unified as or come under the control of the Picts, while southern Scotland experienced an influx of Romanized Britons, and the Scoti (Gaelic Irish raiders) began settling on the west coast.

The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.  [PAR] The festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers.

[PAR] Share this: [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] Author [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] URL [PAR] Google [PAR] August 15, 1914, marks the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Panama Canal, the American-built waterway across the Isthmus of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice. [PAR] In 1902, Congress authorized the purchase of the French assets. However, the following year, when Colombia, which Panama was then a",

[PAR] Each year, the winner of The Masters is presented with the famous \"Green Jacket.\" Slipping on the green jacket is the golden moment for many winners of the tournament. But how did a green jacket come to be such a big deal? What is the story behind the venerated Green Jacket? [PAR] Origins of the Masters Green Jacket [PAR] Let's face it: If you saw someone walking around in public in a shamrock green jacket, you might wonder if that person was fashion-challenged. But the Green Jacket presented to the Masters champion is one beautiful piece of outerwear. [PAR] The tradition of the Green Jacket at Augusta National Golf Club dates to 1937. That year, members of the club wore green jackets during the tournament so that fans in attendance could easily recognize them if a fan needed to ask questions. [PAR] One of the inspirations for the idea was provided by a dinner that Augusta National co-founder Bobby Jones attended at Royal Liverpool . The English links club's captains were adorned in red jackets during that dinner, to stand out. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Greatest Quarterbacks of All Time? [PAR] Augusta National co-founder and club chairman Clifford Roberts embraced the idea of an identifying piece of clothing for club members - something that would make it easy for non-members (and tournament attendees) to recognize an Augusta member. [PAR] According to the tournament's official website, Masters.com: [PAR] \"Jackets were purchased from the Brooks Uniform Company, New York City ... Members were not initially enthusiastic about wearing the warm, green coat. Within several years, a lightweight, made-to-order Jacket was available from the Club's Golf Shop. ... The single breasted, single vent Jacket's color is 'Masters Green' and is adorned with an Augusta National Golf Club logo on the left chest pocket. The logo also appears on the brass buttons.\" [PAR] Presenting the Green Jacket to the Masters Winners [PAR] Soon after its public debut in 1937, the Green Jacket became the symbol of membership in the ultra-exclusive Augusta National Golf Club. [PAR] And winners of the Masters Tournament began, themselves, receiving green jackets at the 1949 Masters . The winners all become members of the Champions Club at Augusta. From 1937 through 1948, only Augusta National members wore the green jackets; from 1949 onward, the tournament winner also got one. [PAR] By the way, in those early years it was just as common to hear Masters players and Augusta members refer to the garment as the \"green blazer\" or \"green coat,\" as it was for them to use \"green jacket.\" [PAR] Who Was the First Masters Champ Presented with the Green Jacket? [PAR] You already know the jacket was first presented to the Masters winner following the 1949 tournament. And the winner that year was Sam Snead . At that time, the club also had jackets made for each of the previous winners of the Masters. For more, see: [PAR] Who was the first Masters champion awarded the Green Jacket? [PAR] Does the Masters Winner Get to Keep the Jacket? [PAR] The short answer: The Green Jacket stays with the new winner for one year. When they return to Augusta National the following year for the next Masters, they return the jacket. But each winner can have his own version of the jacket made to keep at home. For more, see: [PAR] Do Masters champions get to keep the Green Jacket? [PAR] Last Year's Champ Puts the Green Jacket on the New Winner [PAR] Following the completion of each Masters Tournament, the Green Jacket ceremony is held, where the new champion is presented with the green jacket. That jacket is one that tournament officials have retrieved from the locker room, guesstimating what will fit best the new winner. Later, the champ is measured and a jacket custom made for him.

Central themes include the evolution of the jacket as a symbol of Augusta National membership and later as a prize for Masters champions. The narrative traces the initial adoption of the jacket in 1937, inspired by colored jackets at Royal Liverpool, and its transition from being worn solely by club members to being awarded to tournament winners in 1949. Notably, the text highlights the club members' initial reluctance to wear the original jackets due to discomfort (they were \"warm\"), which led to the development of lighter, custom-made versions available from the club's Golf Shop. The unique \"Masters Green\" color and the presence of the club logo on the chest pocket and buttons are also mentioned.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe context implies the importance of symbolism in elite sporting culture, the role of physical comfort in adoption of ceremonial attire, and how traditions adapt over time to meet both practical needs and ceremonial purposes.

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus. He caused Agamemnon to dream of victory by aggressively moving his army forward. Agamemnon tried this and was met by Hector, the brother of Paris. A fight between Paris and Menelaus was suggested.

Central to this is the prophecy delivered by Prometheus warning Zeus that a child born to him and Thetis would eventually dethrone him. In response, Zeus takes decisive action: instead of pursuing Thetis himself, he arranges her marriage to a mortal, Peleus, to avert the threat. Thetis, in her own turn, attempts to make her children immortal, resorting to extreme measures (burning them in fire) and eventually immersing Achilles in the River Styx, leaving only his heel vulnerable. These actions reflect a complex web of divine foresight, intervention, and the consequences of prophecy.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit within the narrative is the Greek mythological motif where prophecy directly shapes the actions of gods and mortals alike. Zeus's decision, prompted by Prometheus\u2019s warning, demonstrates the gods\u2019 susceptibility to fate and their attempts to circumvent it, often resulting in unintended consequences.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] James BondThe James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. [PAR] The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of , there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.  There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). [PAR] The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\" [PAR] Fleming also endowed",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Scotland during the Roman EmpireScotland during the Roman Empire refers to the protohistorical period during which the Roman Empire interacted with the area that is now Scotland, which was known to them as \"Caledonia\". Roman legions arrived around \u00a071, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \"Britain\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \"Albion\", Romans under Q.\u00a0Petillius Cerialis and Gn.\u00a0Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \"Mons Graupius\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. [PAR] The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held any Scottish land at all for about 80 years. Some Scottish historians such as Moffat go so far as to say Rome's presence was entirely uninfluential. \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti, Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast as well. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. [PAR] The dawn of Scottish history [PAR] Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. [PAR] The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \"very large\" British Isles called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285\u00a0 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).  [PAR] The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in \u00a043 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.   The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.  Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.   Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his De Chorographia, written around \u00a043, that there were 30 Orkney islands and seven Haemodae (possibly Shetland).Breeze, David J.",

Modern scholarship rejects earlier exaggerated claims of Roman dominance in Scotland, asserting they never controlled even half its territory and ceased significant influence after 211 CE. The historical complexity is compounded by vague and sometimes contradictory sources, as well as the very short duration of Roman occupation (about 40-80 years at most in any Scottish lands).\n   \n2. **Concept Exploration**\n   - Implicit in the context are several factors that limited Roman permanence: persistent resistance from local Caledonian tribes, logistical and geographical challenges, and possibly the limited strategic or economic value of the region.

The name evokes disdain or contempt among many readers who are otherwise ardent fans of Enid Blyton. What did this ragtag band of four boys, three girls and one dog do to arouse such revulsion? [PAR] Okay, maybe I exaggerated. But for most of us the Secret Seven happens to be the least revered series in Blyton's canon. Is this because the books were written for a younger set of readers? Could it be the smaller format? The perpetual scowl on the face of their highhanded leader, perhaps? [PAR] I expect all these factors do contribute to the\u2014undeserved, if you ask me\u2014negative reputation the Secret Seven has among many Blyton fans. [PAR] And is it mere coincidence that the letters 'SS' have historical connotations that are not exactly pleasant? The series was written between 1948 and 1963, so such an 'inspiration' is not entirely far-fetched. But I think it unlikely\u2014Blyton doesn't seem the sort who would take a sly dig at her own characters, even as a joke. [PAR] So, is the series really as juvenile as it's made out to be? Do the Seven have any redeeming qualities? Let's find out. [PAR] Cast of Characters [PAR] Peter: The head of the Secret Seven, Peter's word is Absolute Law. He usually decides the passwords, and seldom forgets them, unlike the others. Indeed, the easiest way to irk him is to forget the password or the SS badge (which others do with predictable regularity). Though he often acts like a dictator, he is annoyingly proved right on most occasions. The secret meetings are held in a shed at the bottom of the garden, some distance from his house. [PAR] Janet: Peter's sister. Co-owner of the shed and Scamper the golden spaniel, but that ends her stake in the Secret Seven. She comes across as a little brighter than the other two girls in the club (in one instance she sensibly makes a drawing of some tyre prints when the other girls only titter), but that's probably because she's constantly under Peter's thumb and doesn't dare to giggle quite so frequently. Her urge to dance in the moonlight comes in useful while trapping horse stealers on one occasion. [PAR] Jack: Jack is one of the more colourful characters. He's apparently second-in-command (though this is mentioned only once or twice in the books). He's also disappointingly gullible sometimes. In Secret Seven on the Trail, he believes the tall tales his sister Susie and her friends make up. He also forgets the Secret Seven password with exasperating regularity; indeed, Susie seems to remember it better than he does! To his credit, he is as brave and loyal as a right-hand man can be. [PAR] Pam: One of the two gigglers in the club. Perhaps her sole contribution to the club is when she \"interviews\" her grandmother in Three Cheers Secret Seven (and misspells the word \"absolutely\" in the process). She's a great friend of Barbara, for obvious reasons. Either of them is sportingly ready for a good cry when Peter starts shouting\u2014at them or one of the others, it doesn't matter. [PAR] Barbara: Giggles, squeals and shrieks come naturally to Barbara, as they do to Pam. Indeed, you can't easily tell one from the other. Perhaps that's why Derek Lucas' illustrations show Pam in pigtails, while Barbara leaves her hair free. I used to consider her very pretty in those illustrations when I was ten years old. Ah, the follies of youth. [PAR] Colin: Though he can be easily confused with George, Colin makes some interesting discoveries. For instance, he was the one who spots the escaping thief in Secret Seven Adventure, and the one who forgets the book about ships in the cubby-hole up a tree in Well Done Secret Seven. Oh, and it was at his granny's",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context provides a critical overview of Enid Blyton's \"The Secret Seven,\" specifically focusing on the characterization of its members. Notably, Pam and Barbara are described together, both labeled as \"gigglers\" whose main contributions are minimal\u2014Pam's only notable act being an interview with her grandmother, during which she misspells \"absolutely.\" Their friendship is emphasized, as is their tendency to cry when Peter, the group's authoritarian leader, shouts. The text juxtaposes this with Janet, portrayed as more sensible and less frivolous due to her proximity to Peter's authority. The depiction of Pam and Barbara is marked by emotional volatility and lack of substantive agency.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in the analysis is a critique of gender roles within the series. Pam and Barbara are reduced to emotional responses (giggles, squeals, shrieks, crying), with little individual differentiation or development.

Named after George Washington, the first President of the United States, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which had been ceded by Britain in 1846 in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon Boundary Dispute.  It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital.  Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State or the State of Washington to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington. [PAR] Washington is the 18th largest with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people.  Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west, mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast and far southeast, and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.  Mount Rainier is the state's highest elevation at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 m). [PAR] Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. [PAR] Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The Washington Territory was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The area was originally part of a region called the Columbia District after the Columbia River. Incidentally, the area was renamed Washington in order to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, which contains the city of Washington.  [PAR] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president. To distinguish it from the U.S. capital, which is also named for George Washington, Washington is sometimes referred to as \"Washington State\", or, in more formal contexts, as \"the State of Washington\". Washingtonians and other residents of the Pacific Northwest refer to the state simply as \"Washington\", calling the nation's capital \"Washington, D.C.\" or, more often, simply \"D.C.\".

This oval cabochon shows the agate-like banding in various shades of green that is typical of malachite. The puffed heart shows concentric structures. [PAR] What is Malachite? [PAR] Malachite is a green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with a chemical composition of Cu2(CO3)(OH)2.  It was one of the first ores used to produce copper metal.  It is of minor importance today as an ore of copper because it is usually found in small quantities and can be sold for higher prices for other types of use. [PAR] Malachite has been used as a gemstone and sculptural material for thousands of years and is still popular today.  Today it is most often cut into cabochons or beads for jewelry use. [PAR] Malachite has a green color that does not fade over time or when exposed to light.  Those properties, along with its ability to be easily ground to a powder, made malachite a preferred pigment and coloring agent for thousands of years. [PAR] Botryoidal Malachite: Close-up of botryoidal malachite in a seafoam green color from Bisbee, Arizona. This view spans an area of the specimen about 5 millimeters wide and high. Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Where Does Malachite Form? [PAR] Malachite is a mineral that forms at shallow depths within the Earth, in the oxidizing zone above copper deposits. It precipitates from descending solutions in fractures, caverns, cavities, and the intergranular spaces of porous rock. It often forms within limestone where a subsurface chemical environment favorable for the formation of carbonate minerals can occur.  Associated minerals include azurite , bornite , calcite , chalcopyrite , copper , cuprite , and a variety of iron oxides. [PAR] Some of the first malachite deposits to be exploited were located in Egypt and Israel.  Over 4000 years ago, they were mined and used to produce copper.  Material from these deposits was also used to produce gemstones, sculptures, and pigments.  Several large deposits in the Ural Mountains of Russia were aggressively mined, and they supplied abundant gem and sculptural material in the 1800s.  Very little is produced from these deposits today.  Much of the  malachite entering the lapidary market today is from deposits in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Smaller amounts are produced in Australia, France, and Arizona. [PAR] Stalactitic malachite: A specimen of stalactitic malachite from the Kasompi Mine, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The specimen is approximately 21 x 16 x 12 centimeters in size. Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Physical Properties of Malachite [PAR] A minor ore of copper. Gemstones, small sculptures, pigment. [PAR] Physical Properties of Malachite [PAR] Malachite's most striking physical property is its green color.  All specimens of the mineral are green and range from a pastel green, to a bright green, to an extremely dark green that is almost black.  It is typically found as stalactites and botryoidal coatings on the surfaces of underground cavities - similar to the deposits of calcite found in caves.  When these materials are cut into slabs and pieces, the sawn surfaces often exhibit banding and eyes that are similar to agate . [PAR] Malachite is rarely found as a crystal, but when found, the crystals are usually acicular to tabular in shape.  The crystals are bright green in color, translucent, with a vitreous to adamantine luster.  Non-crystalline specimens are opaque, usually with a dull to earthy luster. [PAR] Malachite is a copper mineral, and that  gives malachite a high specific gravity that ranges from 3.6 to 4.0.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context provides a detailed overview of malachite, emphasizing its chemical composition, physical properties, and, crucially, its uses throughout history and today. Malachite has served as an ore of copper, a pigment, a gemstone, and a sculptural material. Historically, it was a primary copper ore in ancient Egypt and Israel over 4000 years ago. Its deep green color, stability under light, and ease of grinding made it a preferred pigment. In contemporary times, its use as an ore has diminished due to its occurrence in small quantities and the higher value it commands in lapidary and artistic markets. The context also highlights the transition of major sources from the Ural Mountains to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, reflecting shifts in supply and demand.\n\n2.

[PAR] Although he only ruled for two years \u2013 from 1483 to 1485 \u2013 Richard III stands out among his peers as one of the most famous (or infamous) Kings of England. But who was he? And why does he continue to inspire such interest? [PAR] Richard was born in Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire on 2 October 1452 \u2013 about 30 miles (50km) from Leicester and only about 40 miles (65km - two days\u2019 ride) from Bosworth where he met his end a third of a century later.

This has been widely debated for many years, with passionate arguments made both for and against Richard. [PAR] Death and disappearance [PAR] After defeating an unsuccessful rebellion in October 1483, Richard led his army to Bosworth in Leicestershire two years later to face Henry Tudor (whose somewhat tenuous claim to the throne was also through descent from Edward III). On 22 August 1485, Richard was killed at Bosworth Field, the last English King to die in battle, thereby bringing to an end both the Plantagenet dynasty and the Wars of the Roses. Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII. [PAR] Richard\u2019s body was brought back to Leicester, publicly displayed and then given for burial to a group of Franciscan friars.

[PAR] Each year, the winner of The Masters is presented with the famous \"Green Jacket.\" Slipping on the green jacket is the golden moment for many winners of the tournament. But how did a green jacket come to be such a big deal? What is the story behind the venerated Green Jacket? [PAR] Origins of the Masters Green Jacket [PAR] Let's face it: If you saw someone walking around in public in a shamrock green jacket, you might wonder if that person was fashion-challenged. But the Green Jacket presented to the Masters champion is one beautiful piece of outerwear. [PAR] The tradition of the Green Jacket at Augusta National Golf Club dates to 1937. That year, members of the club wore green jackets during the tournament so that fans in attendance could easily recognize them if a fan needed to ask questions. [PAR] One of the inspirations for the idea was provided by a dinner that Augusta National co-founder Bobby Jones attended at Royal Liverpool . The English links club's captains were adorned in red jackets during that dinner, to stand out. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Greatest Quarterbacks of All Time? [PAR] Augusta National co-founder and club chairman Clifford Roberts embraced the idea of an identifying piece of clothing for club members - something that would make it easy for non-members (and tournament attendees) to recognize an Augusta member. [PAR] According to the tournament's official website, Masters.com: [PAR] \"Jackets were purchased from the Brooks Uniform Company, New York City ... Members were not initially enthusiastic about wearing the warm, green coat. Within several years, a lightweight, made-to-order Jacket was available from the Club's Golf Shop. ... The single breasted, single vent Jacket's color is 'Masters Green' and is adorned with an Augusta National Golf Club logo on the left chest pocket. The logo also appears on the brass buttons.\" [PAR] Presenting the Green Jacket to the Masters Winners [PAR] Soon after its public debut in 1937, the Green Jacket became the symbol of membership in the ultra-exclusive Augusta National Golf Club. [PAR] And winners of the Masters Tournament began, themselves, receiving green jackets at the 1949 Masters . The winners all become members of the Champions Club at Augusta. From 1937 through 1948, only Augusta National members wore the green jackets; from 1949 onward, the tournament winner also got one. [PAR] By the way, in those early years it was just as common to hear Masters players and Augusta members refer to the garment as the \"green blazer\" or \"green coat,\" as it was for them to use \"green jacket.\" [PAR] Who Was the First Masters Champ Presented with the Green Jacket? [PAR] You already know the jacket was first presented to the Masters winner following the 1949 tournament. And the winner that year was Sam Snead . At that time, the club also had jackets made for each of the previous winners of the Masters. For more, see: [PAR] Who was the first Masters champion awarded the Green Jacket? [PAR] Does the Masters Winner Get to Keep the Jacket? [PAR] The short answer: The Green Jacket stays with the new winner for one year. When they return to Augusta National the following year for the next Masters, they return the jacket. But each winner can have his own version of the jacket made to keep at home. For more, see: [PAR] Do Masters champions get to keep the Green Jacket?

To dam the great Zambezi floodplain was in many ways a hopeful leap into the future. Vast areas of forest and scrub would be inundated.

Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. [PAR] The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of , there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.  There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball).

The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0...

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context details the creation and inspiration behind the character James Bond, focusing specifically on Ian Fleming's deliberate choice of the name \"James Bond.\" Fleming selected the name from an American ornithologist, noting its plainness, masculinity, and lack of romantic connotation. He intended Bond to be a \"neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department,\" rather than a colorful or flamboyant character. Fleming contrasted Bond\u2019s name with a more exotic alternative (\"Peregrine Carruthers\"), emphasizing his desire for the character to be a vessel for extraordinary events rather than standing out himself.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in Fleming's rationale is a nuanced understanding of literary character function: Bond\u2019s neutrality and anonymity allow readers to project themselves onto him and for the plot's \"exotic things\" to stand in starker relief.

[PAR] Each year, the winner of The Masters is presented with the famous \"Green Jacket.\" Slipping on the green jacket is the golden moment for many winners of the tournament. But how did a green jacket come to be such a big deal? What is the story behind the venerated Green Jacket? [PAR] Origins of the Masters Green Jacket [PAR] Let's face it: If you saw someone walking around in public in a shamrock green jacket, you might wonder if that person was fashion-challenged. But the Green Jacket presented to the Masters champion is one beautiful piece of outerwear. [PAR] The tradition of the Green Jacket at Augusta National Golf Club dates to 1937. That year, members of the club wore green jackets during the tournament so that fans in attendance could easily recognize them if a fan needed to ask questions. [PAR] One of the inspirations for the idea was provided by a dinner that Augusta National co-founder Bobby Jones attended at Royal Liverpool . The English links club's captains were adorned in red jackets during that dinner, to stand out. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Greatest Quarterbacks of All Time? [PAR] Augusta National co-founder and club chairman Clifford Roberts embraced the idea of an identifying piece of clothing for club members - something that would make it easy for non-members (and tournament attendees) to recognize an Augusta member. [PAR] According to the tournament's official website, Masters.com: [PAR] \"Jackets were purchased from the Brooks Uniform Company, New York City ... Members were not initially enthusiastic about wearing the warm, green coat. Within several years, a lightweight, made-to-order Jacket was available from the Club's Golf Shop. ... The single breasted, single vent Jacket's color is 'Masters Green' and is adorned with an Augusta National Golf Club logo on the left chest pocket. The logo also appears on the brass buttons.\" [PAR] Presenting the Green Jacket to the Masters Winners [PAR] Soon after its public debut in 1937, the Green Jacket became the symbol of membership in the ultra-exclusive Augusta National Golf Club. [PAR] And winners of the Masters Tournament began, themselves, receiving green jackets at the 1949 Masters . The winners all become members of the Champions Club at Augusta. From 1937 through 1948, only Augusta National members wore the green jackets; from 1949 onward, the tournament winner also got one. [PAR] By the way, in those early years it was just as common to hear Masters players and Augusta members refer to the garment as the \"green blazer\" or \"green coat,\" as it was for them to use \"green jacket.\" [PAR] Who Was the First Masters Champ Presented with the Green Jacket? [PAR] You already know the jacket was first presented to the Masters winner following the 1949 tournament. And the winner that year was Sam Snead . At that time, the club also had jackets made for each of the previous winners of the Masters. For more, see: [PAR] Who was the first Masters champion awarded the Green Jacket? [PAR] Does the Masters Winner Get to Keep the Jacket? [PAR] The short answer: The Green Jacket stays with the new winner for one year. When they return to Augusta National the following year for the next Masters, they return the jacket. But each winner can have his own version of the jacket made to keep at home. For more, see: [PAR] Do Masters champions get to keep the Green Jacket? [PAR] Last Year's Champ Puts the Green Jacket on the New Winner [PAR] Following the completion of each Masters Tournament, the Green Jacket ceremony is held, where the new champion is presented with the green jacket. That jacket is one that tournament officials have retrieved from the locker room, guesstimating what will fit best the new winner. Later, the champ is measured and a jacket custom made for him.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen English counties and cover 9.3% of England, with no national park in the central counties. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land. The Lake District National Park at  is the largest National Park in England and second largest in the United Kingdom after Scotland's Cairngorms National Park. Snowdonia National Park, at ,",

Key elements include the dual aims of conservation and public enjoyment (with conservation prioritized under the Sandford Principle), the unique administrative structure (not state-owned, with multiple landowners), and statutory obligations under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The passage traces the roots of national park designation back to early public access movements, the 1932 Kinder Scout trespass, and post-WWII legislative action. The chronology of park designations is specified, including the first four parks in 1951, subsequent additions, and legislative exceptions such as the Broads Act 1988. The text distinguishes the English/Welsh model from international approaches and notes geographical distribution and coverage percentages.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe context implicitly contrasts the English/Welsh model with those of other countries, highlighting the absence of state ownership and the integration of human land uses.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] James BondThe James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. [PAR] The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of , there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.  There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). [PAR] The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0...

[PAR] Warhead 2000 (proposed) [PAR] Never Say Never Again is the second James Bond theatrical film not produced by EON Productions and the second film adaptation of the story Thunderball . Released in 1983, it stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was released theatrically by Warner Bros. [PAR] The film is not considered part of the canon of the Bond film franchise from EON Productions and United Artists , despite its currently being handled by the official film series distributor, MGM. MGM acquired the distribution rights in 1997 after their acquisition of Orion Pictures. The film also marks the culmination of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory . Its release opposite the franchise Bond film Octopussy (starring Roger Moore ) quickly led the media to dub the situation the \" Battle of the Bonds \". [PAR] In November 2013, the McClory Estate and EON Productions reached an agreement transferring all rights to Fleming's Thunderball, the organization of [PAR] , and the character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld to EON. [PAR] Contents [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] Plot summary [PAR] Being the second adaptation of the novel Thunderball, Never Say Never Again follows a similar plotline to the earlier film, but with some differences. [PAR] The film opens with a middle-aged, yet still athletic James Bond making his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond lets his guard down, forgetting that the girl might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is stabbed to death by her. Or so it seems. [PAR] In fact, the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. [PAR] Feeling that Bond is slipping, M orders him to enroll in a health clinic in order to \"eliminate all those free radicals\" and get back into shape. While there, Bond discovers a mysterious nurse, Fatima Blush , and her patient, who is wrapped in bandages. His suspicions are aroused even further when a thug (Lippe) tries to kill him. [PAR] Blush and her charge, an American Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi , are in fact operatives of [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] , a criminal organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his retinas to match the retinal pattern of the American President. Using his position as a pilot, and the president's eye pattern to circumvent security, Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world. [PAR] M reluctantly reactivates the 00 section, and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons, beginning with a rendezvous with Domino Petachi , the pilot's sister, who is kept a virtual prisoner by her lover, Maximillian Largo . Bond pursues Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas , where he engages Domino, Fatima Blush, and Largo in a game of wits and resources as he attempts to derail [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] 's scheme.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses \"Never Say Never Again,\" a 1983 James Bond film starring Sean Connery, notable for not being produced by EON Productions and thus not considered canonical within the main franchise. The text highlights several key elements: the film's legal and production background, its status as a second adaptation of \"Thunderball,\" and its distinct narrative and character choices compared to EON-produced films. It notes the introduction of a new M, a diminished and underfunded MI6 (especially Q-Branch), and Domino Petachi, who is reimagined as the sister of Jack Petachi and captive of Largo.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe film's non-EON status allowed for reinterpretation of the Bond universe. The new M is characterized as skeptical of the 00-section, differing from previous portrayals. Q-Branch's underfunding alters its narrative role. Domino's characterization and relationship dynamics are slightly altered, with her being a virtual prisoner and connected to the central plot via her brother. These reinterpretations reflect both creative and possibly budgetary or legal constraints, and offer insight into how a familiar universe can be reshaped outside canonical stewardship.\n\n3.

These changes are linked to the film's independent production status, which allowed narrative and thematic deviations from EON's established characterizations.\n\nCorrect Answer: M is portrayed as dismissive of the 00-section, Q-Branch is depicted as underfunded and less resourceful, and Domino is recast as the captive sister of the pilot, all reflecting the film's non-canonical, independent approach and its departure from established EON character dynamics.\n</output_format>",

The state is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the United States. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Tallahassee is the state capital. [PAR] A peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida, it has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately 1350 mi, and is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. The American alligator, American crocodile, Florida panther, and manatee can be found in the Everglades National Park. [PAR] Since the first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u00a0\u2013 who named it La Florida ( \"land of flowers\") upon landing there in the Easter season, Pascua Florida \u00a0\u2013 Florida was a challenge for the European colonial powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Native Americans, and racial segregation after the American Civil War. [PAR] Today, Florida is distinctive for its large Cuban expatriate community and high population growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues. The state's economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also renown for amusement parks, orange crops, the Kennedy Space Center, and as a popular destination for retirees. [PAR] Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and Latino, and African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. Florida has attracted many writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes. It is internationally known for golf, tennis, auto racing and water sports. [PAR] History [PAR] By the 16th century, the earliest time for which there is a historical record, major Native American groups included the Apalachee (of the Florida Panhandle), the Timucua (of northern and central Florida), the Ais (of the central Atlantic coast), the Tocobaga (of the Tampa Bay area), the Calusa (of southwest Florida) and the Tequesta (of the southeastern coast). [PAR] European arrival [PAR] Florida was the first part of the continental United States to be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Ponce de Le\u00f3n spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named the region La Florida (\"land of flowers\"). The story that he was searching for the Fountain of Youth is a myth.  [PAR] \"In May 1539, Conquistador Hernando de Soto skirted the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. He described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching as high as 70 ft, with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult. Very soon, 'many smokes' appeared 'along the whole coast', billowing against the sky, when the Native ancestors of the Seminole spotted the newcomers and spread the alarm by signal fires\".  The Spanish introduced Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Spanish language, and more to Florida.  Both the Spanish and French established settlements in Florida, with varying degrees of success. In 1559, Don Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano established a settlement at present-day Pensacola, making it the first attempted settlement in Florida, but it was abandoned by 1561. [PAR] In 1565,",

[PAR] Al Capone was a notorious gangster who ran an organized crime syndicate in Chicago during the 1920s, taking advantage of the era of Prohibition . Capone, who was both charming and charitable as well as powerful and vicious, became an iconic figure of the successful American gangster. [PAR] Dates: January 17, 1899 -- January 25, 1947 [PAR] Also Known As: Alphonse Capone, Scarface [PAR] Al Capone's Childhood [PAR] Al Capone was the fourth of nine children born to Gabriele and Teresina (Teresa) Capone. Although Capone's parents had emigrated from Italy, Al Capone grew up in Brooklyn, New York . [PAR] From all known accounts, Capone's childhood was a normal one. His father was a barber and his mother stayed home with the children. They were a tight-knit Italian family who were trying to succeed in their new country. [PAR] Like many immigrant families at the time, the Capone children often dropped out of school early to help earn money for the family. Al Capone stayed in school until he was 14 and then left to take a number of odd jobs. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] The St. Valentine's Day Massacre [PAR] Around the same time, Capone joined a street gang called the South Brooklyn Rippers and then later the Five Points Juniors. These were groups of teenagers who roamed the streets, protected their turf from rival gangs, and sometimes carried out petty crimes like stealing cigarettes. [PAR] Scarface [PAR] It was through the Five Points gang that Al Capone came to the attention of brutal New York mobster Frankie Yale. In 1917, 18-year-old Al Capone went to work for Yale at the Harvard Inn as a bartender and as a waiter and bouncer when needed. Capone watched and learned as Yale used violence to maintain control over his empire. [PAR] One day while working at the Harvard Inn, Capone saw a man and woman sitting at a table. After his initial advances were ignored, Capone went up to the good-looking woman and whispered in her ear, \"Honey, you have a nice ass and I mean that as a compliment.\" The man with her was her brother, Frank Gallucio. [PAR] Defending his sister's honor, Gallucio punched Capone. However, Capone didn't let it end there; he decided to fight back. Gallucio then took out a knife and slashed at Capone's face, managing to cut Capone's left cheek three times (one of which cut Capone from ear to mouth). The scars left from this attack led to Capone's nickname of \"Scarface,\" a name he personally hated. [PAR] Family Life [PAR] Not long after this attack, Al Capone met Mary (\"Mae\") Coughlin, who was pretty, blonde, middle-class, and came from a respectable Irish family. A few months after they started dating, Mae became pregnant. Al Capone and Mae got married on December 30, 1918, three weeks after their son (Albert Francis Capone, a.k.a. \"Sonny\") was born. Sonny was to remain Capone's only child. [PAR] Throughout the rest of his life, Al Capone kept his family and his business interests completely separate. Capone was a doting father and husband, taking great care in keeping his family safe, cared for, and out of the spotlight. [PAR] However, despite his love for his family, Capone did have a number of mistresses over the years. Plus, unknown to him at the time, Capone contracted syphilis from a prostitute before he met Mae. Since the symptoms of syphilis can disappear quickly, Capone had no idea that he still had the sexually transmitted disease or that it would so greatly affect his health in later years. [PAR] Capone Moves to Chicago [PAR] About 1920, Capone left the East Coast and headed to Chicago. He was looking for a fresh start working for Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio. Unlike Yale who used violence to run his racket, Torrio was a sophisticated gentleman who preferred cooperation and negotiation to rule his crime organization. Capone",

In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people,  requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water, and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.  [PAR] The festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. [PAR] Glastonbury Festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981; since then, it has been held every year, except for \"fallow years\" taken every five years, intended to give the land, local population, and organisers a break. [PAR] History  [PAR] A series of concerts, lectures and recitals called the Glastonbury Festivals was established with a summer school in the town of Glastonbury between 1914 and 1926 by classical composer Rutland Boughton (1878\u20131960), and with their location attracted a bohemian audience by the standards of the time. They featured works by then-contemporary composers, sponsored by the Clark family, as well as a wide range of traditional works, from Everyman to James Shirley's Cupid and Death.  [PAR] 1970s  [PAR] Pilton Festival 1970 [PAR] Glastonbury was heavily influenced by hippie ethics and the free festival movement in the early 1970s, beginning with the Isle of Wight Festival, which featured performances by The Who, amongst many other artists. Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970.  The festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area, encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field. [PAR] The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, mounted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people. The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced at short notice by Tyrannosaurus Rex, later known as T. Rex. Tickets were \u00a31.

The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the \"Pyramid Stage\". Conceived by Bill Harkin the stage was a one-tenth replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza built from scaffolding and metal sheeting and positioned over a blind spring which was found by dowsing.  [PAR] Performers included David Bowie, Mighty Baby, Traffic, Fairport Convention, Gong, Hawkwind, Skin Alley, The Worthy Farm Windfuckers and Melanie. It was paid for by its supporters and advocates of its ideal, and embraced a mediaeval tradition of music, dance, poetry, theatre, lights, and spontaneous entertainment.

It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital.  Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State or the State of Washington to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington. [PAR] Washington is the 18th largest with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people.  Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west, mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast and far southeast, and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.  Mount Rainier is the state's highest elevation at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 m). [PAR] Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. [PAR] Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The Washington Territory was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The area was originally part of a region called the Columbia District after the Columbia River. Incidentally, the area was renamed Washington in order to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, which contains the city of Washington.  [PAR] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president. To distinguish it from the U.S. capital, which is also named for George Washington, Washington is sometimes referred to as \"Washington State\", or, in more formal contexts, as \"the State of Washington\".

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context presents a detailed overview of Al Capone's early life and development into an iconic gangster. A major theme is the influence of key figures during Capone's formative years, especially the role of Frankie Yale. Capone's exposure to organized crime, his early participation in street gangs, and his subsequent employment under Yale are highlighted as pivotal experiences. The narrative emphasizes how Capone learned from Yale's methods, particularly Yale's use of violence to maintain authority.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThere are subtle themes regarding the function of mentorship and modeling in criminal enterprises. Yale's mentorship is depicted as both practical and ideological, imparting not just operational knowledge but also the ethos of using violence as a means to power. This contrasts with later influences, such as Johnny Torrio's more sophisticated approach, suggesting the complexity of Capone's development. Implicitly, the narrative invites reflection on how personal characteristics (charm, violence) are shaped by these mentors.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Marilyn MonroeMarilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926\u00a0\u2013 August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult. Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928. The identity",

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus. He caused Agamemnon to dream of victory by aggressively moving his army forward. Agamemnon tried this and was met by Hector, the brother of Paris. A fight between Paris and Menelaus was suggested. The two faced each other in the",

Released in 1983, it stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was released theatrically by Warner Bros. [PAR] The film is not considered part of the canon of the Bond film franchise from EON Productions and United Artists , despite its currently being handled by the official film series distributor, MGM. MGM acquired the distribution rights in 1997 after their acquisition of Orion Pictures. The film also marks the culmination of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory .

[PAR] Contents [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] Plot summary [PAR] Being the second adaptation of the novel Thunderball, Never Say Never Again follows a similar plotline to the earlier film, but with some differences. [PAR] The film opens with a middle-aged, yet still athletic James Bond making his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond lets his guard down, forgetting that the girl might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is stabbed to death by her. Or so it seems. [PAR] In fact, the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. [PAR] Feeling that Bond is slipping, M orders him to enroll in a health clinic in order to \"eliminate all those free radicals\" and get back into shape. While there, Bond discovers a mysterious nurse, Fatima Blush , and her patient, who is wrapped in bandages. His suspicions are aroused even further when a thug (Lippe) tries to kill him. [PAR] Blush and her charge, an American Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi , are in fact operatives of [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] , a criminal organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his retinas to match the retinal pattern of the American President. Using his position as a pilot, and the president's eye pattern to circumvent security, Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Enid Blyton - The Secret SevenEnid Blyton - The Secret Seven [PAR] In Defence of the Secret Seven [PAR] Article by Hari Menon (September 11, 2006) [PAR] Secret Seven! The name evokes disdain or contempt among many readers who are otherwise ardent fans of Enid Blyton. What did this ragtag band of four boys, three girls and one dog do to arouse such revulsion? [PAR] Okay, maybe I exaggerated. But for most of us the Secret Seven happens to be the least revered series in Blyton's canon. Is this because the books were written for a younger set of readers? Could it be the smaller format? The perpetual scowl on the face of their highhanded leader, perhaps? [PAR] I expect all these factors do contribute to the\u2014undeserved, if you ask me\u2014negative reputation the Secret Seven has among many Blyton fans. [PAR] And is it mere coincidence that the letters 'SS' have historical connotations that are not exactly pleasant? The series was written between 1948 and 1963, so such an 'inspiration' is not entirely far-fetched. But I think it unlikely\u2014Blyton doesn't seem the sort who would take a sly dig at her own characters, even as a joke. [PAR] So, is the series really as juvenile as it's made out to be? Do the Seven have any redeeming qualities? Let's find out. [PAR] Cast of Characters [PAR] Peter: The head of the Secret Seven, Peter's word is Absolute Law. He usually decides the passwords, and seldom forgets them, unlike the others. Indeed, the easiest way to irk him is to forget the password or the SS badge (which others do with predictable regularity). Though he often acts like a dictator, he is annoyingly proved right on most occasions. The secret meetings are held in a shed at the bottom of the garden, some distance from his house. [PAR] Janet: Peter's sister. Co-owner of the shed and Scamper the golden spaniel, but that ends her stake in the Secret Seven. She comes across as a little brighter than the other two girls in the club (in one instance she sensibly makes a drawing of some tyre prints when the other girls only titter), but that's probably because she's constantly under Peter's thumb and doesn't dare to giggle quite so frequently. Her urge to dance in the moonlight comes in useful while trapping horse stealers on one occasion. [PAR] Jack: Jack is one of the more colourful characters. He's apparently second-in-command (though this is mentioned only once or twice in the books). He's also disappointingly gullible sometimes. In Secret Seven on the Trail, he believes the tall tales his sister Susie and her friends make up. He also forgets the Secret Seven password with exasperating regularity; indeed, Susie seems to remember it better than he does! To his credit, he is as brave and loyal as a right-hand man can be. [PAR] Pam: One of the two gigglers in the club. Perhaps her sole contribution to the club is when she \"interviews\" her grandmother in Three Cheers Secret Seven (and misspells the word \"absolutely\" in the process). She's a great friend of Barbara, for obvious reasons. Either of them is sportingly ready for a good cry when Peter starts shouting\u2014at them or one of the others, it doesn't matter. [PAR] Barbara: Giggles, squeals and shrieks come naturally to Barbara, as they do to Pam. Indeed, you can't easily tell one from the other. Perhaps that's why Derek Lucas' illustrations show Pam in pigtails, while Barbara leaves her hair free. I used to consider her very pretty in those illustrations when I was ten years old. Ah, the follies of youth. [PAR] Colin: Though he can be easily confused with George, Colin makes some interesting discoveries. For instance, he was the one who spots the escaping thief in Secret Seven Adventure, and the one who forgets the book about ships in the cubby-hole up a tree in Well Done Secret Seven. Oh, and it was at his granny's",
    "topic": "Reflection on the use of humor, nostalgia, and authorial voice in Hari Menon's defense of the Secret Seven series.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context is an article by Hari Menon defending Enid Blyton's Secret Seven series. The article opens with a playful exaggeration about the negative reputation of the series, followed by speculation on possible reasons for this perception (target age group, format, leadership style). Menon interjects with personal opinion, gently mocking these criticisms. There is a tongue-in-cheek mention of the historical connotations of \"SS,\" with the author quickly dismissing any such intentional reference by Blyton. The narrative then transitions to character sketches, each laced with humor (e.g., Peter's dictatorial tendencies, Janet's subservience, the giggling girls, Jack's gullibility, and the indistinguishable nature of Pam and Barbara). The tone blends fond reminiscence with gentle satire, showing both affection and critical distance from the series.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe use of humor is evident in the playful exaggerations, mock criticisms, and affectionate ribbing of characters. Nostalgia is interwoven through personal anecdotes and references to childhood impressions (e.g., the author's youthful admiration for Barbara). The authorial voice is self-aware, subjective, and openly acknowledges biases, inviting the reader to reconsider preconceived judgments. Implicit is the idea that the series' reputation may be shaped as much by cultural perceptions and reader maturity as by literary merit.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

It notes the complexity and perceived illogical structure of the system, especially for those unfamiliar with it, and highlights the transition to a decimal currency system in 1971, where 100 pennies equaled \u00a31. The context points out that the pound\u2019s value remained unchanged but the denominations and their relationships were significantly altered. It also touches on the historical reasons for introducing certain coins (e.g., the Florin as a step towards decimalisation) and the lingering use or adaptation of some coins after decimalisation.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**  \nImplicit in the text is the notion that the pre-decimal system was confusing and potentially inefficient, especially for those outside the culture or under 50 years old.

In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people,  requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water, and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.  [PAR] The festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. [PAR] Glastonbury Festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981; since then, it has been held every year, except for \"fallow years\" taken every five years, intended to give the land, local population, and organisers a break. [PAR] History  [PAR] A series of concerts, lectures and recitals called the Glastonbury Festivals was established with a summer school in the town of Glastonbury between 1914 and 1926 by classical composer Rutland Boughton (1878\u20131960), and with their location attracted a bohemian audience by the standards of the time. They featured works by then-contemporary composers, sponsored by the Clark family, as well as a wide range of traditional works, from Everyman to James Shirley's Cupid and Death.  [PAR] 1970s  [PAR] Pilton Festival 1970 [PAR] Glastonbury was heavily influenced by hippie ethics and the free festival movement in the early 1970s, beginning with the Isle of Wight Festival, which featured performances by The Who, amongst many other artists. Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970.  The festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area, encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field. [PAR] The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, mounted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people. The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced at short notice by Tyrannosaurus Rex, later known as T. Rex. Tickets were \u00a31.

The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the \"Pyramid Stage\".

[PAR] There has never been an openly gay president of the United States, but some historians have argued the first and only bachelor president , James Buchanan, may have had feelings for a member of the same sex. [PAR] The nation's 15th president is the nation's only bachelor president. A lifelong bachelor, Buchanan had a very close relationship with William Rufus De Vane King, a diplomat who served as U.S. senator and the nation's 13th vice president. King was the only vice president to never have been married. [PAR] Buchanan and King, in fact, lived together for more than two decades, although that was a relatively common practice in the 1800s. [PAR] Buchanan the Bachelor President [PAR] Historians who believe Buchanan and King were intimate often cite their contemporaries in Washington, who reportedly described King as being effeminate and called him \"Miss Nancy\" and Buchanan's \"better half.\" [PAR] They also cite letters written by Buchanan about the man described as his soulmate. [PAR] After King left the United States to become the minister to France, Buchanan wrote to a friend: [PAR] \"I am now solitary and alone, having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone; and should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.\" [PAR] Also, King showed his own affection for Buchanan at his departure by writing to him: \"I am selfish enough to hope you will not be able to procure an associate who will cause you to feel no regret at our separation.\" [PAR] Historians Claim Buchanan Was Gay [PAR] James Loewen, a prominent American sociologist and historian, has been the most outspoken academic who claims Buchanan was the first gay president. [PAR] \"There can be no doubt that James Buchanan was gay, before, during, and after his four years in the White House,\" Loewen wrote in a 2012 essay. \"Moreover, the nation knew it, too - he was not far into the closet. Today, I know no historian who has studied the matter and thinks Buchanan was heterosexual.\" [PAR] Loewen has argued that Buchanan's homosexuality is not often discussed in modern times because Americans do not want to believe society was more tolerant of gay relationships in the 19th Century than they are now. [PAR] Loewen does not explain, however, how or why a gay Buchanan had been engaged to a woman long before he became president. The woman, Ann Coleman, died and the two never wed. [PAR] Bachelor Presidential Candidate in 2016 [PAR] The closest the nation has come to having a bachelor president after Buchanan was in the 2016 election , when Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina sought the party's presidential nomination. Graham's candidacy was shortlived, however. Had he been elected, however, he said he'd have a \"rotating first lady.\" [PAR] \"Well, I've got a sister, she could play that role if necessary,\" Graham also joked. [PAR] Barack Obama as First Gay President [PAR] President Barack Obama has been described as being the first gay president, a symbolic label first used in a May 2012 Newsweek magazine headline. [PAR] The Democrat earned the label during his first term for his vocal support of gay marriage in May 2012 , making him the the first president in U.S. history to take such a position. [PAR] Obama is married to Michelle Obama , and the couple has two daughters. [PAR] Newsweek Cover [PAR] Newsweek's editor, Tina Brown , explained the term and picture of Obama with a rainbow halo superimposed over his head this way: [PAR] \"If President Clinton was the \u2018first black president\u2019 then Obama earns every stripe in that \u2018gaylo\u2019 with last week\u2019s gay marriage proclamation ,\" Brown told the online news site Politico",

Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\" [PAR] Fleming also endowed",

It highlights the adaptations across media and the recurring features that define the Bond franchise. Importantly, it explores Fleming\u2019s explicit admission that Bond is an amalgam of real individuals encountered during his service in WWII, including his own brother and others. Fleming's intentional choice of a plain, \"unromantic\" name from an actual ornithologist further blurs the boundary between fact and fiction. Physical and psychological traits of Bond are also constructed with reference to real people (Hoagy Carmichael, Fleming himself), demonstrating a deliberate blend of real-world inspiration and fictional enhancement.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**\n   - The text reveals implicit assumptions about the desirability of grounding a fictional hero in real-world experience to lend authenticity. Fleming\u2019s insistence on a neutral, almost anonymous persona for Bond reflects a nuanced understanding of spycraft: the ideal agent is both nondescript and capable of extraordinary actions. The layering of traits from various real individuals and the selection of a deliberately ordinary name suggest a strategy to make Bond simultaneously plausible and mythic, approachable yet iconic.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**\n   - The interplay between historical reality and fictionalization is inherently complex, inviting high-level analysis of how myth is constructed from fact.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context provides a comprehensive overview of the history, legal framework, and development of national parks in England and Wales. Central themes include the dual aims of national parks (conservation and public enjoyment), their unique administrative structure (not state-owned, many private and public landowners), and the legislative journey that began in the late 19th century and culminated in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Notably, the Industrial Revolution\u2019s transformation of landscapes and society catalyzed public movements for countryside access. The Kinder Scout trespass of 1932 stands out as a pivotal event that exemplifies public discontent and activism, influencing eventual legislation. The text also traces the sequence and timing of park designations, revealing the slow, contested process influenced by social and political forces.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nUnderlying the narrative is an assumption that national heritage and public access are intertwined but sometimes conflicting priorities, as reflected in legal principles such as the Sandford Principle. The context highlights the difference between the UK model and that of other nations (e.g., state ownership in the USA/Germany vs. mixed ownership in the UK). The discussion of events such as the Kinder Scout mass trespass illustrates the impact of grassroots activism on policy, suggesting a dynamic interplay between public agency and legislative change.

Harry was delighted and couldn't thank Hagrid enough, while Hedwig had already fallen asleep after leaving the shop. [2] This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the Dursleys did not celebrate his brithday. He became quickly attached to her. [PAR] Harry Potter's pet [PAR] Harry decided on her name after finding it in A History of Magic . Before attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Harry routinely stayed in his bedroom with Hedwig, away from the Dursleys , since she was his only friend at 4 Privet Drive . [4] Throughout her life, Hedwig provided Harry with mail service, as well as loyal companionship. Hedwig often showed Harry her affection by gently nibbling his ears and fingers, and seemed fully capable of understanding his wishes (as she faithfully followed Harry's orders to peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger until they responded to him). [PAR] Hedwig with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley [PAR] Hedwig was also highly intelligent, as she flew to France completely of her own accord while Hermione was on holiday there with her parents, just to ensure that Harry received a gift from her for his thirteenth birthday, later arriving at the Leaky Cauldron shortly after Harry stormed out of Privet Drive after a particularly bad argument despite the fact that she had been away and allegedly staying with the Weasleys when Harry left the Dursleys. According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions. She also seemed fairly disdainful of the hyperactive behaviour of Ron Weasley 's pet owl Pigwidgion (Pig, as Ron called him) [PAR] Harry having Hedwig deliver a message to Sirius Black [PAR] While living with the Dursleys , Hedwig was locked in her cage for months at a time to prevent Harry from sending messages to his \"freaky little friends.\" As a result, the first holidays after Hogwarts were a frustrating and boring time for her, as much as for Harry. When Harry was rescued by the Weasley brothers in 1992 , Hedwig was freed from her cage and flew along following behind the flying Ford Anglia all the way to The Burrow . In 1992 when Harry thought his friends had forgotten him, he mused that Hedwig was the only reason he knew that discovering the wizarding world had not just been a dream. Fortunately, her frustrated hooting during her first year with them convinced the Dursleys to subsequently let Harry let Hedwig out for flights so long as he didn't use her to send messages, though Harry sometimes ignored this rule and possibly began ignoring it entirely after meeting Sirius Black and gaining leverage with the Dursleys.

The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.  [PAR] Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;   the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.  Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster \u2013 with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.  [PAR] Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa. Most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).   This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.  [PAR] Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name. [PAR] According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85\u2013165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \"Africa\" expanded with their knowledge. [PAR] Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \"Africa\": [PAR] * The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Scotland during the Roman EmpireScotland during the Roman Empire refers to the protohistorical period during which the Roman Empire interacted with the area that is now Scotland, which was known to them as \"Caledonia\". Roman legions arrived around \u00a071, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \"Britain\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \"Albion\", Romans under Q.\u00a0Petillius Cerialis and Gn.\u00a0Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \"Mons Graupius\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. [PAR] The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held any Scottish land at all for about 80 years. Some Scottish historians such as Moffat go so far as to say Rome's presence was entirely uninfluential. \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti, Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast as well. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. [PAR] The dawn of Scottish history [PAR] Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. [PAR] The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \"very large\" British Isles called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285\u00a0 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).  [PAR] The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in \u00a043 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.   The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.  Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.   Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his De Chorographia, written around \u00a043, that there were 30 Orkney islands and seven Haemodae (possibly Shetland).Breeze, David J.",

[PAR] Al Capone was a notorious gangster who ran an organized crime syndicate in Chicago during the 1920s, taking advantage of the era of Prohibition . Capone, who was both charming and charitable as well as powerful and vicious, became an iconic figure of the successful American gangster. [PAR] Dates: January 17, 1899 -- January 25, 1947 [PAR] Also Known As: Alphonse Capone, Scarface [PAR] Al Capone's Childhood [PAR] Al Capone was the fourth of nine children born to Gabriele and Teresina (Teresa) Capone. Although Capone's parents had emigrated from Italy, Al Capone grew up in Brooklyn, New York . [PAR] From all known accounts, Capone's childhood was a normal one. His father was a barber and his mother stayed home with the children. They were a tight-knit Italian family who were trying to succeed in their new country. [PAR] Like many immigrant families at the time, the Capone children often dropped out of school early to help earn money for the family. Al Capone stayed in school until he was 14 and then left to take a number of odd jobs. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] The St. Valentine's Day Massacre [PAR] Around the same time, Capone joined a street gang called the South Brooklyn Rippers and then later the Five Points Juniors. These were groups of teenagers who roamed the streets, protected their turf from rival gangs, and sometimes carried out petty crimes like stealing cigarettes. [PAR] Scarface [PAR] It was through the Five Points gang that Al Capone came to the attention of brutal New York mobster Frankie Yale. In 1917, 18-year-old Al Capone went to work for Yale at the Harvard Inn as a bartender and as a waiter and bouncer when needed. Capone watched and learned as Yale used violence to maintain control over his empire. [PAR] One day while working at the Harvard Inn, Capone saw a man and woman sitting at a table. After his initial advances were ignored, Capone went up to the good-looking woman and whispered in her ear, \"Honey, you have a nice ass and I mean that as a compliment.\" The man with her was her brother, Frank Gallucio. [PAR] Defending his sister's honor, Gallucio punched Capone. However, Capone didn't let it end there; he decided to fight back. Gallucio then took out a knife and slashed at Capone's face, managing to cut Capone's left cheek three times (one of which cut Capone from ear to mouth). The scars left from this attack led to Capone's nickname of \"Scarface,\" a name he personally hated. [PAR] Family Life [PAR] Not long after this attack, Al Capone met Mary (\"Mae\") Coughlin, who was pretty, blonde, middle-class, and came from a respectable Irish family. A few months after they started dating, Mae became pregnant. Al Capone and Mae got married on December 30, 1918, three weeks after their son (Albert Francis Capone, a.k.a. \"Sonny\") was born. Sonny was to remain Capone's only child. [PAR] Throughout the rest of his life, Al Capone kept his family and his business interests completely separate. Capone was a doting father and husband, taking great care in keeping his family safe, cared for, and out of the spotlight. [PAR] However, despite his love for his family, Capone did have a number of mistresses over the years. Plus, unknown to him at the time, Capone contracted syphilis from a prostitute before he met Mae. Since the symptoms of syphilis can disappear quickly, Capone had no idea that he still had the sexually transmitted disease or that it would so greatly affect his health in later years. [PAR] Capone Moves to Chicago [PAR] About 1920, Capone left the East Coast and headed to Chicago. He was looking for a fresh start working for Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio. Unlike Yale who used violence to run his racket, Torrio was a sophisticated gentleman who preferred cooperation and negotiation to rule his crime organization. Capone",

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context provides a biographical sketch of Al Capone, focusing on his early life, family, rise to notoriety, and personal characteristics. Of particular interest is the mention that Capone unknowingly contracted syphilis from a prostitute prior to his marriage, remaining unaware due to the transient nature of the symptoms. This infection is noted to have had significant effects on his health later in life. The text also highlights the strict separation Capone maintained between his family and criminal enterprises, his efforts to keep them safe, and his attempt to maintain a respectable domestic life.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe implicit assumption is that syphilis, with its initially subtle or vanishing symptoms, can remain latent and untreated, leading to severe health complications over time. The fact that Capone was unaware of his infection suggests a lack of medical screening or understanding of the disease's progression at the time. There are also nuanced implications concerning the intersection of personal health, criminal lifestyle, and the ability to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of normalcy or control. Furthermore, the later consequences of untreated syphilis in Capone\u2019s case likely had profound implications on his capacity to lead, his legal battles, and the eventual decline of his criminal empire.\n\n3.

Harry was delighted and couldn't thank Hagrid enough, while Hedwig had already fallen asleep after leaving the shop. [2] This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the Dursleys did not celebrate his brithday. He became quickly attached to her. [PAR] Harry Potter's pet [PAR] Harry decided on her name after finding it in A History of Magic . Before attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Harry routinely stayed in his bedroom with Hedwig, away from the Dursleys , since she was his only friend at 4 Privet Drive . [4] Throughout her life, Hedwig provided Harry with mail service, as well as loyal companionship. Hedwig often showed Harry her affection by gently nibbling his ears and fingers, and seemed fully capable of understanding his wishes (as she faithfully followed Harry's orders to peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger until they responded to him). [PAR] Hedwig with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley [PAR] Hedwig was also highly intelligent, as she flew to France completely of her own accord while Hermione was on holiday there with her parents, just to ensure that Harry received a gift from her for his thirteenth birthday, later arriving at the Leaky Cauldron shortly after Harry stormed out of Privet Drive after a particularly bad argument despite the fact that she had been away and allegedly staying with the Weasleys when Harry left the Dursleys. According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions. She also seemed fairly disdainful of the hyperactive behaviour of Ron Weasley 's pet owl Pigwidgion (Pig, as Ron called him) [PAR] Harry having Hedwig deliver a message to Sirius Black [PAR] While living with the Dursleys , Hedwig was locked in her cage for months at a time to prevent Harry from sending messages to his \"freaky little friends.\" As a result, the first holidays after Hogwarts were a frustrating and boring time for her, as much as for Harry. When Harry was rescued by the Weasley brothers in 1992 , Hedwig was freed from her cage and flew along following behind the flying Ford Anglia all the way to The Burrow . In 1992 when Harry thought his friends had forgotten him, he mused that Hedwig was the only reason he knew that discovering the wizarding world had not just been a dream. Fortunately, her frustrated hooting during her first year with them convinced the Dursleys to subsequently let Harry let Hedwig out for flights so long as he didn't use her to send messages, though Harry sometimes ignored this rule and possibly began ignoring it entirely after meeting Sirius Black and gaining leverage with the Dursleys.

Her intelligence and loyalty underscore her role as a companion, but her origin as a magical creature\u2014acquired in Diagon Alley and not native to Britain\u2014further emphasizes her function as a symbol of otherness and transformation.

In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context traces the evolution of the French presidential term lengths and term limits. Initially, there was no limit on the number of terms. The term length was seven years before being reduced to five years by a 2000 referendum, with the first five-year term election held in 2002. Notably, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand served for 14 years (two full terms), and Jacques Chirac served for 12 years (two full terms). A 2008 constitutional law imposed a limit of two consecutive terms for the presidency.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe text implicitly highlights the interplay between political reform and institutional stability, suggesting that changes to term lengths and limits were responses to evolving democratic expectations and possibly to prevent excessive concentration of power. The unique durations of Mitterrand\u2019s and Chirac\u2019s presidencies, both predating the two-term limit, set historical precedents that are now structurally impossible.\n\n3.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context details the progression of gender dynamics at BBC Radio 1, focusing on DJ appointments. Historically, there was significant resistance to hiring female DJs, exemplified by Annie Nightingale's experiences\u2014she was told that DJs served as \"husband substitutes\" for housewives, and a female voice would disrupt this. Despite these barriers, Nightingale became the station's first female DJ and eventually a long-standing figure. Over time, institutional attitudes shifted: by 2014, Radio 1 celebrated International Women\u2019s Day with an all-female DJ line-up, and Nightingale herself observed that gender was \"welcomingly, not an issue nowadays\" in appointments. The content juxtaposes early institutional sexism with later efforts at inclusion and recognition of individual merit.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the text demonstrates a transition from overt gender bias (e.g., exclusion based on assumptions about audience preferences and gender roles) to an environment where ability is purportedly prioritized and gender is less of a barrier. Individual experiences (Nightingale's campaign, early challenges, eventual acceptance) highlight the slow process of institutional change and the persistence required by pioneers. The all-female event marks both symbolic and practical affirmation of changed attitudes, though the need for such an event may suggest ongoing gender-awareness initiatives.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 9/10. \nThe question must demand synthesis of institutional and individual perspectives, require nuanced evaluation of historical and contemporary attitudes, and probe implicit tensions or contradictions (e.g., the necessity of an all-female line-up as both a celebration and a possible indicator of ongoing gender issues).\n\n4. Intentional Question Planning:\nTo probe expert understanding, the question should require analysis of both overt and subtle shifts in policy and culture, interpretation of individual narratives as reflective of wider institutional trends, and critical consideration of symbolic gestures versus substantive change. It should challenge the respondent to articulate how these dynamics interrelate and what they reveal about broader societal shifts in gender and media.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does the trajectory of Annie Nightingale\u2019s career at BBC Radio 1, from initial institutional resistance to her celebration as a pioneering DJ, reflect broader shifts in the station\u2019s policies and cultural attitudes toward gender, and what tensions or contradictions are suggested by the staging of an all-female DJ line-up for International Women\u2019s Day?\n\nExplanation: The answer synthesizes the evolution from explicit institutional sexism\u2014where female DJs were excluded based on gendered assumptions\u2014to a contemporary posture that claims gender neutrality in appointments, as seen in Nightingale's reflections and the symbolic all-female line-up. The tension lies in the simultaneous assertion that gender is \"not an issue\" while still marking progress through gender-specific initiatives, suggesting that while policy and attitudes have shifted, full normalization and integration may still require deliberate acts of visibility and celebration.\n\nCorrect Answer: The trajectory illustrates a shift from exclusionary, gendered institutional policies to a stated meritocratic ideal, yet the need for an all-female line-up underscores persistent contradictions\u2014despite progress, gender remains salient enough to warrant targeted celebration, reflecting both advancement and ongoing negotiation of equality.\n</output_format>",

Specific mention is made of the oldest and youngest winners: Halle Berry, noted as the oldest at 37, and Keira Knightley, the youngest at 21. The tone and descriptions often reflect the cultural and societal attitudes of the time, particularly relating to perceptions of attractiveness, sexuality, and age.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The explicit noting of Halle Berry\u2019s age (\"still the oldest lady on record to have won FHM\u2019s Sexiest Woman in the World \u2013 believe it or not she was 37\") and Keira Knightley (\"Youngest winner on record... just 21\") highlights that age is seen as a noteworthy factor in the awarding of this title.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**\n   - The context details the denominations and values of British pre-decimal coins and references the transition to decimal currency in 1971. It specifically mentions that after decimalisation, certain pre-decimal coins (e.g., shilling and florin) continued to circulate as equivalent decimal denominations (five and ten new pence, respectively) until their eventual withdrawal or replacement by smaller coins in 1990 and 1992. The context also notes the rationale behind the florin\u2019s introduction as a step toward decimalisation, being exactly one-tenth of a pound.\n2. **Concept Exploration**\n   - Implicitly, the continued use of shillings and florins as decimal coins suggests a strategy to ease the public\u2019s adaptation to the new system by maintaining familiar coinage.

From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. [PAR] The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century.  The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'.

The non-metropolitan district of Lincoln has a 2012 population of 94,600.  The 2011 census gave the entire urban area of Lincoln (which includes North Hykeham and Waddington) a population of 130,200.  [PAR] Lincoln developed from the Roman town of Lindum Colonia, which developed from an Iron Age settlement. Lincoln's major landmarks are Lincoln Cathedral, a famous example of English Gothic architecture, and Lincoln Castle, an 11th-century Norman castle. The city is also home to the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University. Lincoln is situated in a gap in the Lincoln Cliff 141 mi north of London, at an elevation of  above sea level by the River Witham, stretching up to 75 m above sea level in the uphill area around the cathedral. [PAR] History [PAR] Earliest history: Lincoln [PAR] The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in 1972) that have been dated to the 1st century BC. This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the River Witham at the foot of a large hill (on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle). [PAR] The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brythonic language of Iron Age Britain's Celtic inhabitants as Lindon \"The Pool\",  presumably referring to the Brayford Pool (compare the etymology of the name Dublin, from the Gaelic dubh linn \"black pool\"). The extent of this original settlement is unknown as its remains are now buried deep beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins, and modern Lincoln. [PAR] Roman history: Lindum Colonia [PAR] The Romans conquered this part of Britain in AD 48 and shortly afterwards built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake formed by the widening of the River Witham (the modern day Brayford Pool) and at the northern end of the Fosse Way Roman road (A46). The Celtic name Lindon was subsequently Latinised to Lindum and given the title Colonia when it was converted into a settlement for army veterans.  [PAR] The conversion to a colonia was made when the legion moved on to York (Eboracum) in AD 71. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after its founder Domitian, was established within the walls of the hilltop fortress with the addition of an extension of about equal area, down the hillside to the waterside below. [PAR] It became a major flourishing settlement, accessible from the sea both through the River Trent and through the River Witham. On the basis of the patently corrupt list of British bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles, the city is now often considered to have been the capital of the province of Flavia Caesariensis which was formed during the late-3rd century Diocletian Reforms. Subsequently, however, the town and its waterways fell into decline. By the close of the 5th century the city was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a Praefectus Civitatis, for Saint Paulinus visited a man of this office in Lincoln in AD 629. [PAR] AD 410\u20131066 [PAR] During this period the Latin name Lindum Colonia was shortened in Old English to become first Lindocolina, then Lincylene.  [PAR] After the first destructive Viking raids, the city once again rose to some importance, with overseas trading connections. In Viking times Lincoln was a trading centre that issued coins from its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to the mint at York.  After the establishment of Dane Law in 886, Lincoln became one of The Five Boroughs in the East Midlands. Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that this area, deserted since Roman times, received new timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system in about 900.

He was the Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016, and has been Member of Parliament for Witney since 2001. Cameron identifies as a One-Nation Conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. [PAR] Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.  It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage. [PAR] Internationally, his government militarily intervened in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured a majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as Prime Minister leading a Conservative government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he chose to resign to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.  [PAR] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for reining in the United Kingdom's national debt. Conversely, he has been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of political opportunism and social elitism. Cameron appeared on the Forbes List of The World's Most Powerful People from 2010.  [PAR] Family [PAR] Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010), a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur,  Mount (born 1934), a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.  Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962. The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".  [PAR] Cameron was born in Marylebone, London,  and raised in Peasemore, Berkshire.  He has a brother, Alexander Cameron, QC (born 1963), a barrister,  and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).  [PAR] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;  Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,  who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.  [PAR] Cameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh, and English.\"  He has also referenced the German Jewish ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the Yiddish author Elia Levita.   [PAR] Education [PAR] From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its old boys. Owing to good grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early.",

ISBN 0-7613-1367-2. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.  [PAR] Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;   the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.  Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster \u2013 with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.  [PAR] Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa. Most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).   This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.  [PAR] Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name. [PAR] According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85\u2013165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \"Africa\" expanded with their knowledge. [PAR] Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \"Africa\": [PAR] * The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.

Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult. Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928. The identity",

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context provides an overview of Achilles in Greek mythology, focusing on his origins, education, participation in the Trojan War, and especially the episode involving his mother Thetis attempting to render him immortal by dipping him in the River Styx. A specific detail is that Thetis held Achilles by the heel, leaving that spot untouched by the river's power, and thus vulnerable. This episode is the origin of the metaphor \"Achilles heel,\" denoting a critical vulnerability.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe narrative of the River Styx and the literal vulnerability of Achilles's heel is deeply symbolic\u2014connecting themes of mortality, the limits of divine intervention, and the inescapability of fate. The mother's attempt to overcome human frailty results in the creation of a single point of weakness, which then becomes emblematic of the idea that even the mightiest possess inherent vulnerabilities.

This oval cabochon shows the agate-like banding in various shades of green that is typical of malachite. The puffed heart shows concentric structures. [PAR] What is Malachite? [PAR] Malachite is a green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with a chemical composition of Cu2(CO3)(OH)2.  It was one of the first ores used to produce copper metal.  It is of minor importance today as an ore of copper because it is usually found in small quantities and can be sold for higher prices for other types of use. [PAR] Malachite has been used as a gemstone and sculptural material for thousands of years and is still popular today.  Today it is most often cut into cabochons or beads for jewelry use. [PAR] Malachite has a green color that does not fade over time or when exposed to light.  Those properties, along with its ability to be easily ground to a powder, made malachite a preferred pigment and coloring agent for thousands of years. [PAR] Botryoidal Malachite: Close-up of botryoidal malachite in a seafoam green color from Bisbee, Arizona. This view spans an area of the specimen about 5 millimeters wide and high. Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Where Does Malachite Form? [PAR] Malachite is a mineral that forms at shallow depths within the Earth, in the oxidizing zone above copper deposits. It precipitates from descending solutions in fractures, caverns, cavities, and the intergranular spaces of porous rock. It often forms within limestone where a subsurface chemical environment favorable for the formation of carbonate minerals can occur.  Associated minerals include azurite , bornite , calcite , chalcopyrite , copper , cuprite , and a variety of iron oxides. [PAR] Some of the first malachite deposits to be exploited were located in Egypt and Israel.  Over 4000 years ago, they were mined and used to produce copper.  Material from these deposits was also used to produce gemstones, sculptures, and pigments.  Several large deposits in the Ural Mountains of Russia were aggressively mined, and they supplied abundant gem and sculptural material in the 1800s.  Very little is produced from these deposits today.  Much of the  malachite entering the lapidary market today is from deposits in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Smaller amounts are produced in Australia, France, and Arizona. [PAR] Stalactitic malachite: A specimen of stalactitic malachite from the Kasompi Mine, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The specimen is approximately 21 x 16 x 12 centimeters in size. Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Physical Properties of Malachite [PAR] A minor ore of copper. Gemstones, small sculptures, pigment. [PAR] Physical Properties of Malachite [PAR] Malachite's most striking physical property is its green color.  All specimens of the mineral are green and range from a pastel green, to a bright green, to an extremely dark green that is almost black.  It is typically found as stalactites and botryoidal coatings on the surfaces of underground cavities - similar to the deposits of calcite found in caves.  When these materials are cut into slabs and pieces, the sawn surfaces often exhibit banding and eyes that are similar to agate . [PAR] Malachite is rarely found as a crystal, but when found, the crystals are usually acicular to tabular in shape.  The crystals are bright green in color, translucent, with a vitreous to adamantine luster.  Non-crystalline specimens are opaque, usually with a dull to earthy luster. [PAR] Malachite is a copper mineral, and that  gives malachite a high specific gravity that ranges from 3.6 to 4.0.  This property is so striking for a green mineral that malachite is easy to identify.  Malachite is one of a small number of green minerals that produces effervescence in contact with cold, dilute hydrochloric acid .  It is also  a soft",

Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult.

[PAR] The current President of France is Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who took office on 15 May 2012. [PAR] Election [PAR] Since the Referendum on the Direct Election of the President of the French Republic in 1962, the President has been directly elected by universal suffrage; he or she was previously elected by an electoral college. [PAR] After the Referendum on the Reduction of the Mandate of the President of the French Republic, 2000, the length of the term was reduced to five years from the previous seven; the first election to a shorter term was held in 2002. President Chirac was first elected in 1995 and again in 2002. At that time, there was no limit on the number of terms, so Chirac could have run again, but chose not to. He was succeeded by Nicolas Sarkozy on 16 May 2007. [PAR] Following a further change, the  Constitutional law on the Modernisation of the Institutions of the Fifth Republic, 2008, a president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac are the only Presidents to date who have served a full two terms (14 years for the former, 12 years for the latter). [PAR] In order to be admitted as an official candidate, potential candidates must receive signed nominations (informally known as parrainages, for \"godfathering\") from more than 500 elected officials, mostly mayors. These officials must be from at least 30 d\u00e9partements or overseas collectivities, and no more than 10% of them should be from the same d\u00e9partement or collectivity.. Furthermore, each official may nominate only one candidate.. There are exactly 45,543 elected officials, including 33,872 mayors. [PAR] Spending and financing of campaigns and political parties are highly regulated. There is a cap on spending, at approximately 20\u00a0million euros, and government public financing of 50% of spending if the candidate scores more than 5%. If the candidate receives less than 5% of the vote, the government funds \u20ac8,000,000 to the party (\u20ac4,000,000 paid in advance).  Advertising on TV is forbidden but official time is given to candidates on public TV. An independent agency regulates election and party financing. [PAR] French presidential elections are conducted via run-off voting which ensures that the elected President always obtains a majority: if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting, the two highest-scoring candidates arrive at a run-off. After the president is elected, he goes through a solemn investiture ceremony called a \"passation des pouvoirs\" (\"handing over of powers\").  [PAR] Powers [PAR] The French Fifth Republic is a semi-presidential system. Unlike many other European presidents, the French President is quite powerful. Although it is the Prime Minister of France and parliament that oversee much of the nation's actual day-to-day affairs, the French President wields significant influence and authority, especially in the fields of national security and foreign policy. The president holds the nation's most senior office, and outranks all other politicians. [PAR] The president's greatest power is his/her ability to choose the prime minister.

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus. He caused Agamemnon to dream of victory by aggressively moving his army forward. Agamemnon tried this and was met by Hector, the brother of Paris. A fight between Paris and Menelaus was suggested.

[PAR] The festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.

Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970.  The festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area, encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field. [PAR] The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, mounted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people. The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced at short notice by Tyrannosaurus Rex, later known as T. Rex. Tickets were \u00a31.

The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the \"Pyramid Stage\".

It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital.  Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State or the State of Washington to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington.

The name evokes disdain or contempt among many readers who are otherwise ardent fans of Enid Blyton. What did this ragtag band of four boys, three girls and one dog do to arouse such revulsion? [PAR] Okay, maybe I exaggerated. But for most of us the Secret Seven happens to be the least revered series in Blyton's canon. Is this because the books were written for a younger set of readers? Could it be the smaller format? The perpetual scowl on the face of their highhanded leader, perhaps? [PAR] I expect all these factors do contribute to the\u2014undeserved, if you ask me\u2014negative reputation the Secret Seven has among many Blyton fans. [PAR] And is it mere coincidence that the letters 'SS' have historical connotations that are not exactly pleasant? The series was written between 1948 and 1963, so such an 'inspiration' is not entirely far-fetched. But I think it unlikely\u2014Blyton doesn't seem the sort who would take a sly dig at her own characters, even as a joke. [PAR] So, is the series really as juvenile as it's made out to be? Do the Seven have any redeeming qualities? Let's find out. [PAR] Cast of Characters [PAR] Peter: The head of the Secret Seven, Peter's word is Absolute Law. He usually decides the passwords, and seldom forgets them, unlike the others. Indeed, the easiest way to irk him is to forget the password or the SS badge (which others do with predictable regularity). Though he often acts like a dictator, he is annoyingly proved right on most occasions. The secret meetings are held in a shed at the bottom of the garden, some distance from his house. [PAR] Janet: Peter's sister. Co-owner of the shed and Scamper the golden spaniel, but that ends her stake in the Secret Seven. She comes across as a little brighter than the other two girls in the club (in one instance she sensibly makes a drawing of some tyre prints when the other girls only titter), but that's probably because she's constantly under Peter's thumb and doesn't dare to giggle quite so frequently. Her urge to dance in the moonlight comes in useful while trapping horse stealers on one occasion. [PAR] Jack: Jack is one of the more colourful characters. He's apparently second-in-command (though this is mentioned only once or twice in the books). He's also disappointingly gullible sometimes. In Secret Seven on the Trail, he believes the tall tales his sister Susie and her friends make up. He also forgets the Secret Seven password with exasperating regularity; indeed, Susie seems to remember it better than he does! To his credit, he is as brave and loyal as a right-hand man can be. [PAR] Pam: One of the two gigglers in the club. Perhaps her sole contribution to the club is when she \"interviews\" her grandmother in Three Cheers Secret Seven (and misspells the word \"absolutely\" in the process). She's a great friend of Barbara, for obvious reasons. Either of them is sportingly ready for a good cry when Peter starts shouting\u2014at them or one of the others, it doesn't matter. [PAR] Barbara: Giggles, squeals and shrieks come naturally to Barbara, as they do to Pam. Indeed, you can't easily tell one from the other. Perhaps that's why Derek Lucas' illustrations show Pam in pigtails, while Barbara leaves her hair free. I used to consider her very pretty in those illustrations when I was ten years old. Ah, the follies of youth. [PAR] Colin: Though he can be easily confused with George, Colin makes some interesting discoveries. For instance, he was the one who spots the escaping thief in Secret Seven Adventure, and the one who forgets the book about ships in the cubby-hole up a tree in Well Done Secret Seven. Oh, and it was at his granny's",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context is an analytical article reflecting on Enid Blyton's \"The Secret Seven,\" focusing on the perception of the series and a detailed cast breakdown. The passage specifically addresses Jack's position as \"apparently second-in-command,\" noting that this is rarely emphasized in the books. His character is described as \"colourful,\" \"gullible sometimes,\" particularly in relation to his sister Susie's stories, and forgetful regarding the club's password. Despite these flaws, he is described as \"brave and loyal as a right-hand man can be.\" The article notes that Susie, not a club member, often remembers the password better than Jack.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe text implicitly questions the validity and narrative function of Jack's second-in-command status, given his frequent forgetfulness and gullibility. His loyalty and bravery are highlighted as redeeming traits, suggesting a nuanced interplay between competence and reliability. The text seems to use Jack\u2019s flaws as both comic relief and as a way to humanize the group dynamic. The forgetfulness and gullibility may serve narrative purposes: tension, relatability, and contrast with the more dictatorial Peter. Susie's role as an outsider who is more competent in some respects also challenges the club's internal hierarchy.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 9/10.

[PAR] Warhead 2000 (proposed) [PAR] Never Say Never Again is the second James Bond theatrical film not produced by EON Productions and the second film adaptation of the story Thunderball . Released in 1983, it stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was released theatrically by Warner Bros. [PAR] The film is not considered part of the canon of the Bond film franchise from EON Productions and United Artists , despite its currently being handled by the official film series distributor, MGM. MGM acquired the distribution rights in 1997 after their acquisition of Orion Pictures. The film also marks the culmination of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory . Its release opposite the franchise Bond film Octopussy (starring Roger Moore ) quickly led the media to dub the situation the \" Battle of the Bonds \".

[PAR] Contents [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] Plot summary [PAR] Being the second adaptation of the novel Thunderball, Never Say Never Again follows a similar plotline to the earlier film, but with some differences. [PAR] The film opens with a middle-aged, yet still athletic James Bond making his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond lets his guard down, forgetting that the girl might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is stabbed to death by her. Or so it seems. [PAR] In fact, the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. [PAR] Feeling that Bond is slipping, M orders him to enroll in a health clinic in order to \"eliminate all those free radicals\" and get back into shape. While there, Bond discovers a mysterious nurse, Fatima Blush , and her patient, who is wrapped in bandages. His suspicions are aroused even further when a thug (Lippe) tries to kill him. [PAR] Blush and her charge, an American Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi , are in fact operatives of [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] , a criminal organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his retinas to match the retinal pattern of the American President. Using his position as a pilot, and the president's eye pattern to circumvent security, Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world. [PAR] M reluctantly reactivates the 00 section, and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons, beginning with a rendezvous with Domino Petachi , the pilot's sister, who is kept a virtual prisoner by her lover, Maximillian Largo . Bond pursues Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas , where he engages Domino, Fatima Blush, and Largo in a game of wits and resources as he attempts to derail [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] 's scheme.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context explains that \"Never Say Never Again\" is the second James Bond film not produced by EON Productions and is a re-adaptation of \"Thunderball.\" It was theatrically released by Warner Bros. and starred Sean Connery. Despite MGM (the current Bond distributor) acquiring its rights in 1997, the film is not considered part of the canonical Bond series, which is defined by EON Productions and United Artists. The context also mentions a legal dispute culminating in EON gaining rights to \"Thunderball,\" SPECTRE, and Blofeld in 2013. The distinction between canonical and non-canonical Bond films is thus tied to production origins rather than current distribution.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThere is an implicit distinction between production and distribution: EON-produced films are canonical, regardless of later distribution arrangements. Even after MGM, the main Bond distributor, acquired \"Never Say Never Again,\" its non-EON production status kept it outside the canon. The underlying assumption is that the \"canon\" is defined by the production house (EON), not by distribution rights, release, or cast.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 9/10. The question requires synthesis of nuanced production and distribution history, legal settlements, and the canonical criteria used within the Bond franchise, demanding a deep understanding of film industry practices and franchise management.\n\n4. Intentional Question Planning:\nThe question should probe the expert's understanding of why \"Never Say Never Again\" remains non-canonical despite having the same main character, actor, and current official distribution. It should require reflection on the primacy of production origin over distribution in defining franchise canon, and the impact of legal rights on such classification.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of the James Bond film franchise, what is the decisive factor that excludes \"Never Say Never Again\" from canonical status, even after its distribution rights were acquired by MGM, and how does this reflect the franchise's approach to canon in relation to production history versus distribution?\n\nExplanation: The correct answer hinges on the fact that the Bond franchise defines canon strictly by EON Productions' involvement, not by current distribution rights, legal settlements, or casting choices. \"Never Say Never Again\" was not produced by EON but by an external party, and even after MGM acquired distribution, its non-canonical status remained because the franchise canon is determined by production lineage.\n\nCorrect Answer: Only films produced by EON Productions are considered canonical, regardless of subsequent distribution rights or legal settlements.\n</output_format>",

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus. He caused Agamemnon to dream of victory by aggressively moving his army forward. Agamemnon tried this and was met by Hector, the brother of Paris. A fight between Paris and Menelaus was suggested. The two faced each other in the",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context outlines the mythological narrative of Achilles, focusing on his origins, education, and significant events leading up to and during the Trojan War. A key episode is Achilles' concealment on the island of Skyros, where, while disguised as a girl to avoid joining the war, he fathers a son with Deidameia, the king's daughter. This event is presented as both a narrative detail and a point of intersection between themes of fate, identity, and legacy.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe relationship between Achilles and Deidameia is not just a matter of personal romance but is situated within the larger mythic pattern of concealment, fate evasion, and unintended consequences. Achilles' paternity during his concealment raises questions about the intergenerational transmission of heroism, the inevitability of destiny, and the persistent intertwining of public duty and private life in myth. The birth of his son Neoptolemus (though unnamed here) has major implications for the continuation of the heroic lineage and the resolution of the Trojan War.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. The question should require not only knowledge of the specific event (Achilles fathering a son with Deidameia) but also an understanding of its thematic and narrative significance within the broader Greek mythological tradition.\n\n4.

[PAR] Al Capone was a notorious gangster who ran an organized crime syndicate in Chicago during the 1920s, taking advantage of the era of Prohibition . Capone, who was both charming and charitable as well as powerful and vicious, became an iconic figure of the successful American gangster. [PAR] Dates: January 17, 1899 -- January 25, 1947 [PAR] Also Known As: Alphonse Capone, Scarface [PAR] Al Capone's Childhood [PAR] Al Capone was the fourth of nine children born to Gabriele and Teresina (Teresa) Capone. Although Capone's parents had emigrated from Italy, Al Capone grew up in Brooklyn, New York . [PAR] From all known accounts, Capone's childhood was a normal one. His father was a barber and his mother stayed home with the children. They were a tight-knit Italian family who were trying to succeed in their new country. [PAR] Like many immigrant families at the time, the Capone children often dropped out of school early to help earn money for the family. Al Capone stayed in school until he was 14 and then left to take a number of odd jobs. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] The St. Valentine's Day Massacre [PAR] Around the same time, Capone joined a street gang called the South Brooklyn Rippers and then later the Five Points Juniors. These were groups of teenagers who roamed the streets, protected their turf from rival gangs, and sometimes carried out petty crimes like stealing cigarettes. [PAR] Scarface [PAR] It was through the Five Points gang that Al Capone came to the attention of brutal New York mobster Frankie Yale. In 1917, 18-year-old Al Capone went to work for Yale at the Harvard Inn as a bartender and as a waiter and bouncer when needed. Capone watched and learned as Yale used violence to maintain control over his empire. [PAR] One day while working at the Harvard Inn, Capone saw a man and woman sitting at a table. After his initial advances were ignored, Capone went up to the good-looking woman and whispered in her ear, \"Honey, you have a nice ass and I mean that as a compliment.\" The man with her was her brother, Frank Gallucio. [PAR] Defending his sister's honor, Gallucio punched Capone. However, Capone didn't let it end there; he decided to fight back. Gallucio then took out a knife and slashed at Capone's face, managing to cut Capone's left cheek three times (one of which cut Capone from ear to mouth). The scars left from this attack led to Capone's nickname of \"Scarface,\" a name he personally hated. [PAR] Family Life [PAR] Not long after this attack, Al Capone met Mary (\"Mae\") Coughlin, who was pretty, blonde, middle-class, and came from a respectable Irish family. A few months after they started dating, Mae became pregnant. Al Capone and Mae got married on December 30, 1918, three weeks after their son (Albert Francis Capone, a.k.a. \"Sonny\") was born. Sonny was to remain Capone's only child. [PAR] Throughout the rest of his life, Al Capone kept his family and his business interests completely separate. Capone was a doting father and husband, taking great care in keeping his family safe, cared for, and out of the spotlight. [PAR] However, despite his love for his family, Capone did have a number of mistresses over the years. Plus, unknown to him at the time, Capone contracted syphilis from a prostitute before he met Mae. Since the symptoms of syphilis can disappear quickly, Capone had no idea that he still had the sexually transmitted disease or that it would so greatly affect his health in later years. [PAR] Capone Moves to Chicago [PAR] About 1920, Capone left the East Coast and headed to Chicago. He was looking for a fresh start working for Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio. Unlike Yale who used violence to run his racket, Torrio was a sophisticated gentleman who preferred cooperation and negotiation to rule his crime organization. Capone",

In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people,  requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water, and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.  [PAR] The festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. [PAR] Glastonbury Festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981; since then, it has been held every year, except for \"fallow years\" taken every five years, intended to give the land, local population, and organisers a break.

They featured works by then-contemporary composers, sponsored by the Clark family, as well as a wide range of traditional works, from Everyman to James Shirley's Cupid and Death.  [PAR] 1970s  [PAR] Pilton Festival 1970 [PAR] Glastonbury was heavily influenced by hippie ethics and the free festival movement in the early 1970s, beginning with the Isle of Wight Festival, which featured performances by The Who, amongst many other artists. Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970.  The festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area, encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field. [PAR] The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, mounted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people. The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced at short notice by Tyrannosaurus Rex, later known as T. Rex. Tickets were \u00a31.

Named after George Washington, the first President of the United States, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which had been ceded by Britain in 1846 in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon Boundary Dispute.  It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital.  Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State or the State of Washington to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington. [PAR] Washington is the 18th largest with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people.  Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west, mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast and far southeast, and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.  Mount Rainier is the state's highest elevation at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 m). [PAR] Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. [PAR] Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The Washington Territory was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The area was originally part of a region called the Columbia District after the Columbia River. Incidentally, the area was renamed Washington in order to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, which contains the city of Washington.  [PAR] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president. To distinguish it from the U.S. capital, which is also named for George Washington, Washington is sometimes referred to as \"Washington State\", or, in more formal contexts, as \"the State of Washington\". Washingtonians and other residents of the Pacific Northwest refer to the state simply as \"Washington\", calling the nation's capital \"Washington, D.C.\" or, more often, simply \"D.C.\".

[PAR] There has never been an openly gay president of the United States, but some historians have argued the first and only bachelor president , James Buchanan, may have had feelings for a member of the same sex. [PAR] The nation's 15th president is the nation's only bachelor president. A lifelong bachelor, Buchanan had a very close relationship with William Rufus De Vane King, a diplomat who served as U.S. senator and the nation's 13th vice president. King was the only vice president to never have been married. [PAR] Buchanan and King, in fact, lived together for more than two decades, although that was a relatively common practice in the 1800s. [PAR] Buchanan the Bachelor President [PAR] Historians who believe Buchanan and King were intimate often cite their contemporaries in Washington, who reportedly described King as being effeminate and called him \"Miss Nancy\" and Buchanan's \"better half.\" [PAR] They also cite letters written by Buchanan about the man described as his soulmate. [PAR] After King left the United States to become the minister to France, Buchanan wrote to a friend: [PAR] \"I am now solitary and alone, having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone; and should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.\" [PAR] Also, King showed his own affection for Buchanan at his departure by writing to him: \"I am selfish enough to hope you will not be able to procure an associate who will cause you to feel no regret at our separation.\" [PAR] Historians Claim Buchanan Was Gay [PAR] James Loewen, a prominent American sociologist and historian, has been the most outspoken academic who claims Buchanan was the first gay president. [PAR] \"There can be no doubt that James Buchanan was gay, before, during, and after his four years in the White House,\" Loewen wrote in a 2012 essay. \"Moreover, the nation knew it, too - he was not far into the closet. Today, I know no historian who has studied the matter and thinks Buchanan was heterosexual.\" [PAR] Loewen has argued that Buchanan's homosexuality is not often discussed in modern times because Americans do not want to believe society was more tolerant of gay relationships in the 19th Century than they are now. [PAR] Loewen does not explain, however, how or why a gay Buchanan had been engaged to a woman long before he became president. The woman, Ann Coleman, died and the two never wed. [PAR] Bachelor Presidential Candidate in 2016 [PAR] The closest the nation has come to having a bachelor president after Buchanan was in the 2016 election , when Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina sought the party's presidential nomination. Graham's candidacy was shortlived, however. Had he been elected, however, he said he'd have a \"rotating first lady.\" [PAR] \"Well, I've got a sister, she could play that role if necessary,\" Graham also joked.

The narrative shifts to more recent history, mentioning the 2016 presidential candidacy of Lindsey Graham, another lifelong bachelor, and his comments about potentially having a \"rotating first lady.\" The text implies that unmarried presidential candidates are a rarity, and public discourse around their bachelorhood is often colored by speculation or humor.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**  \nThe underlying theme is how bachelorhood in presidential candidates is perceived and discussed in different eras. For Buchanan, bachelorhood led to speculation about his sexuality and close relationships, potentially influenced by 19th-century social norms. For Graham, bachelorhood became a point of light-hearted media attention, with suggestions of a \"rotating first lady\" and involvement of family members.

At 17075200 km2,  Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one eighth of Earth's inhabited land area,    and the ninth most populous, with over 146.6\u00a0million people at the end of March 2016.  Extending across the entirety of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. [PAR] The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century.  The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland in Europe to Alaska in North America.   [PAR] Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the world's first constitutionally socialist state.  The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War\u00a0II,   and emerged as a recognized superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite and the launching of the first humans in space. By the end of 1990, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest economy, largest standing military in the world and  the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction.    Following the partition of the Soviet Union in 1991, fourteen independent republics emerged from the USSR; as the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and sole successor state of the Soviet Union. It is governed as a federal semi-presidential republic. [PAR] The Russian economy ranks as the twelfth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015.  Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world,  making it one of the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia is a great power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the G20, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as being the leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and one of the five members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), along with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.

It highlights the non-decimal structure (with 240 pennies in a pound) and the complex, sometimes inconsistent relationships between denominations (e.g., a half crown is not double a florin). The system's historical context, transition to decimalisation in 1971, and some rationale for certain coins (like the florin as a step toward decimalisation) are included.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe pre-decimal system had denominations that were not strictly powers of two or ten, resulting in conversion complexities (e.g., 12 pennies in a shilling, 20 shillings in a pound, 30 pence in a half crown, etc.). Implicitly, this system required users to be familiar with fractional relationships, mental arithmetic, and non-decimal groupings, increasing cognitive load. Certain coins (florin, shilling) were reused post-decimalisation for a time, showing attempts at continuity. The system's design reflects historical legacy rather than systematic logic, which may have caused confusion, especially for those unfamiliar with it.\n\n3.

[PAR] Election [PAR] Since the Referendum on the Direct Election of the President of the French Republic in 1962, the President has been directly elected by universal suffrage; he or she was previously elected by an electoral college. [PAR] After the Referendum on the Reduction of the Mandate of the President of the French Republic, 2000, the length of the term was reduced to five years from the previous seven; the first election to a shorter term was held in 2002. President Chirac was first elected in 1995 and again in 2002. At that time, there was no limit on the number of terms, so Chirac could have run again, but chose not to. He was succeeded by Nicolas Sarkozy on 16 May 2007. [PAR] Following a further change, the  Constitutional law on the Modernisation of the Institutions of the Fifth Republic, 2008, a president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms.

Advertising on TV is forbidden but official time is given to candidates on public TV. An independent agency regulates election and party financing. [PAR] French presidential elections are conducted via run-off voting which ensures that the elected President always obtains a majority: if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting, the two highest-scoring candidates arrive at a run-off.

Johnny Logan's unique achievement is his triple win: twice as performer (1980, 1987 for Ireland) and once as songwriter (1992 for Linda Martin\u2019s \"Why Me\"), signifying an unparalleled level of personal impact on Eurovision outcomes.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe text implicitly suggests the importance of both musical direction (via conductors like van der Linde) and performance/songwriting (via figures like Logan) in shaping the contest\u2019s history. Van der Linde\u2019s ability to work across national boundaries reflects on Eurovision's collaborative spirit, while Logan's multiple victories highlight individual artistry's role in national success. Both cases prompt deeper consideration of how personal talent and versatility can transcend typical nationalistic boundaries in an international competition.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 9/10. The question must require nuanced synthesis of the roles, contributions, and broader implications of these individuals\u2019 involvement, challenging the expert to compare, contrast, and extrapolate their influence in the context of Eurovision\u2019s evolution.\n\n4. Intentional Question Planning:\nThe question should probe an expert\u2019s ability to critically analyze not only the factual contributions of van der Linde and Logan but also the broader implications of their achievements: the impact of cross-national collaboration, the significance of repeated individual success, and what these patterns reveal about Eurovision\u2019s culture and evolution. The question will require a nuanced, comparative approach, demanding insight into both explicit and implicit influences.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Considering the historical records of both Dolf van der Linde conducting for seven different countries and Johnny Logan achieving three Eurovision wins as both performer and songwriter, how do their respective contributions illustrate differing pathways for individual influence within the context of Eurovision\u2019s evolving traditions?\n\nExplanation: This answer is correct because it synthesizes the contrasting yet significant forms of impact\u2014van der Linde\u2019s cross-national collaborative role as conductor versus Logan\u2019s repeated artistic dominance as performer and songwriter\u2014highlighting how Eurovision enables both behind-the-scenes and on-stage individuals to shape its legacy through distinct avenues of influence.\n\nCorrect Answer: Van der Linde exemplifies transnational musical collaboration behind the scenes, while Logan demonstrates repeated artistic impact as both performer and creator, together illustrating Eurovision\u2019s openness to diverse forms of individual influence.\n</output_format>",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Lincoln, EnglandLincoln is a cathedral city and the county town of Lincolnshire, within the East Midlands of England. The non-metropolitan district of Lincoln has a 2012 population of 94,600.  The 2011 census gave the entire urban area of Lincoln (which includes North Hykeham and Waddington) a population of 130,200.  [PAR] Lincoln developed from the Roman town of Lindum Colonia, which developed from an Iron Age settlement. Lincoln's major landmarks are Lincoln Cathedral, a famous example of English Gothic architecture, and Lincoln Castle, an 11th-century Norman castle. The city is also home to the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University. Lincoln is situated in a gap in the Lincoln Cliff 141 mi north of London, at an elevation of  above sea level by the River Witham, stretching up to 75 m above sea level in the uphill area around the cathedral. [PAR] History [PAR] Earliest history: Lincoln [PAR] The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in 1972) that have been dated to the 1st century BC. This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the River Witham at the foot of a large hill (on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle). [PAR] The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brythonic language of Iron Age Britain's Celtic inhabitants as Lindon \"The Pool\",  presumably referring to the Brayford Pool (compare the etymology of the name Dublin, from the Gaelic dubh linn \"black pool\"). The extent of this original settlement is unknown as its remains are now buried deep beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins, and modern Lincoln. [PAR] Roman history: Lindum Colonia [PAR] The Romans conquered this part of Britain in AD 48 and shortly afterwards built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake formed by the widening of the River Witham (the modern day Brayford Pool) and at the northern end of the Fosse Way Roman road (A46). The Celtic name Lindon was subsequently Latinised to Lindum and given the title Colonia when it was converted into a settlement for army veterans.  [PAR] The conversion to a colonia was made when the legion moved on to York (Eboracum) in AD 71. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after its founder Domitian, was established within the walls of the hilltop fortress with the addition of an extension of about equal area, down the hillside to the waterside below. [PAR] It became a major flourishing settlement, accessible from the sea both through the River Trent and through the River Witham. On the basis of the patently corrupt list of British bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles, the city is now often considered to have been the capital of the province of Flavia Caesariensis which was formed during the late-3rd century Diocletian Reforms. Subsequently, however, the town and its waterways fell into decline. By the close of the 5th century the city was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a Praefectus Civitatis, for Saint Paulinus visited a man of this office in Lincoln in AD 629. [PAR] AD 410\u20131066 [PAR] During this period the Latin name Lindum Colonia was shortened in Old English to become first Lindocolina, then Lincylene.  [PAR] After the first destructive Viking raids, the city once again rose to some importance, with overseas trading connections. In Viking times Lincoln was a trading centre that issued coins from its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to the mint at York.  After the establishment of Dane Law in 886, Lincoln became one of The Five Boroughs in the East Midlands. Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that this area, deserted since Roman times, received new timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system in about 900.  Lincoln experienced an unprecedented explosion in its economy with the settlement of the Danes. Like York, the Upper City seems to have been given over to purely administrative functions up to 850 or so, while the Lower",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context presents a historical overview of Lincoln, with emphasis on its evolution from an Iron Age settlement, through the Roman period (Lindum Colonia), and into the post-Roman and Viking eras. Key points include the decline after Roman rule, urban redevelopment under Viking influence, and the city's role within the Danelaw. Specific details highlight Lincoln\u2019s economic resurgence, the establishment of a local mint, integration into overseas trading networks, and urban renewal via new building initiatives (such as at Flaxengate).\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit is the notion that the Viking settlement and the creation of the Danelaw had transformative effects on Lincoln\u2019s urban structure, economy, and connectivity. The text suggests that Viking influence shifted Lincoln from near-desolation to a prominent trading hub, with institutional developments (mint, street system) and integration into broader economic and political systems (The Five Boroughs, Danelaw).\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 9/10. The question must require synthesis of archaeological, economic, political, and urban development factors, asking for nuanced understanding of multi-layered change, not just factual recall.\n\n4. Intentional Question Planning:\nThe question should probe how Viking settlement and Danelaw governance catalyzed Lincoln\u2019s urban and economic transformation, and how these factors facilitated its integration into wider networks. It should also demand insight into the mechanisms and significance of these changes, as inferred from archaeological and documentary evidence.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Analyze how the Viking settlement and subsequent establishment of the Danelaw catalyzed Lincoln\u2019s urban renewal, economic expansion, and integration into broader trading networks, considering both archaeological evidence and institutional developments such as the mint and new street systems.\n\nExplanation: The answer synthesizes the documented economic resurgence marked by the creation of a mint, the archaeological evidence of new urban infrastructure (e.g., timber-framed buildings and new street systems at Flaxengate), and the political significance of Lincoln as one of the Five Boroughs within the Danelaw. Together, these factors demonstrate that Viking settlement and Danelaw governance transformed Lincoln from a post-Roman decline into a flourishing commercial and administrative center with substantial trading links.\n\nCorrect Answer: Viking settlement and Danelaw rule revitalized Lincoln through urban redevelopment and economic growth\u2014evidenced by new building and street layouts, establishment of a major mint, and integration into international trade networks\u2014positioning the city as a key commercial and administrative hub in the region.\n</output_format>",
