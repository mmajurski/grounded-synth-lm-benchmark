Two MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered.\n\nWe ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed.\n\nEight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly.\n\n",

Both enzymes have been measured simultaneously at our hospital allowing for a comparison of their diagnostic accuracy.\n\nSeventeen thousand five hundred and thirty-one measurements of either serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase were made on 10 931 patients treated at a metropolitan teaching hospital between January 2001 and May 2003. Of these, 8937 were initially treated in the Emergency Department. These results were collected in a database, which was linked by the patients' medical record number to the radiology and medical records. Patients with either an elevated lipase value or a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had their radiological diagnosis reviewed along with their biochemistry and histology record. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made if there was radiological evidence of peripancreatic inflammation.\n\nOne thousand eight hundred and twenty-five patients had either elevated serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase. The medical records coded for pancreatitis in a further 55 whose enzymes were not elevated. Three hundred and twenty of these had radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. Receiver operator characteristic analysis of the initial sample from patients received in the Emergency Department showed improved diagnostic accuracy for serum pancreatic lipase (area under the curve (AUC) 0.948) compared with serum amylase (AUC, 0.906, P<0.05). A clinically useful cut-off point would be at the diagnostic threshold; 208 U/L (normal<190 U/L) for serum pancreatic lipase and 114 U/L (normal 27-100 U/L) for serum amylase where the sensitivity was 90.3 cf., 76.8% and the specificity was 93 cf., 92.6%. 18.8% of the acute pancreatitis patients did not have elevated serum amylase while only 2.9% did not have elevated serum pancreatic lipase on the first emergency department measurement.\n\n",

All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at histopathologic examination.\n\nIn 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated.

Both diseases are associated with neutrophilic inflammation and frequent isolation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), from the lower airway. Defective alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells (efferocytosis), as found in other chronic lung diseases, may also contribute to tissue damage and neutrophil persistence. Thus, in children with bronchiectasis or PBB and in control subjects, we quantified the phagocytosis of airway apoptotic cells and NTHi by alveolar macrophages and related the phagocytic capacity to clinical and airway inflammation.\n\nChildren with bronchiectasis (n = 55) or PBB (n = 13) and control subjects (n = 13) were recruited. Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and expression of phagocytic scavenger receptors were assessed by flow cytometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nFor children with PBB or bronchiectasis, macrophage phagocytic capacity was significantly lower than for control subjects (P = .003 and P<.001 for efferocytosis and P = .041 and P = .004 for phagocytosis of NTHi; PBB and bronchiectasis, respectively); median phagocytosis of NTHi for the groups was as follows: bronchiectasis, 13.7% (interquartile range [IQR], 11%-16%); PBB, 16% (IQR, 11%-16%); control subjects, 19.0% (IQR, 13%-21%); and median efferocytosis for the groups was as follows: bronchiectasis, 14.1% (IQR, 10%-16%); PBB, 16.2% (IQR, 14%-17%); control subjects, 18.1% (IQR, 16%-21%).

When serving as journal reviewers, they may be more favorably disposed to manuscripts that cite their work. We investigate whether manuscripts that contain a citation to the reviewer's work receive higher evaluations than those that do not and\u00a0whether peer reviewers encourage authors to cite that reviewer's work.\n\nWe analyzed all research manuscripts submitted in 2012 to Annals of Emergency Medicine to determine whether they contained citations to each reviewer's work. To determine whether citation affected reviewer scores, we obtained each reviewer's score of the manuscript's overall desirability (1=worst to 5=best) and used descriptive statistics and regression modeling to compare scores of cited and noncited reviewers. We also enumerated how often reviewers suggested that authors add citations to the reviewer's work or other work.\n\nThere were 395 manuscripts and 999 corresponding reviews with an manuscript desirability score. The 83 reviews by cited reviewers (8.3%) had a mean score of 2.8 (SD 1.4); the 916 reviews by noncited reviewers (91.7%), 2.5 (1.2; \u0394=0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 0.6).

The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\n\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\n\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation.

    "context": "Adults with a mild intellectual disability (ID) often show poor decoding and reading comprehension skills. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of teaching text comprehension strategies to these adults. Specific research goals were to determine (1) the effects of two instruction conditions, i.e. strategy instruction to individuals and strategy instruction in small groups in a reciprocal teaching context; (2) intervention programme effects on specific strategy tests (so-called direct effects), and possible differences between strategies; (3) (long-term) transfer effects of the programme on general reading comprehension ability; and (4) the regression of general text comprehension by the variables of technical reading, IQ, reading comprehension of sentences (RCS), and pretest and posttest scores on the strategies taught.\n\nIn total, 38 adults (age range 20-72 years; mean age of 36 years) with ID participated in the study. IQs ranged from 45 to 69 with a mean IQ of 58. The intervention programme involved 15 weekly lessons of 1 h each, taught during 3 months. Blocks of lessons included each of Brown and Palincsar's strategies of summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting, as participants read and studied narrative and expository texts.\n\nResults indicated no significant difference between group and individual instruction conditions. Second, direct programme effects - as determined by posttest-pretest contrasts for strategy tests - were substantial, except for the questioning strategy. Third, even more substantial was the transfer effect to general text comprehension. Moreover, the results on this test were well maintained at a follow-up test. Finally, the variance of general reading comprehension ability was best explained by the test of RCS, and only moderately by the strategies trained.\n\n",

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "A retrospective analysis.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether the deformity angular ratio (DAR) can reliably assess the neurological risks of patients undergoing deformity correction.\n\nIdentifying high-risk patients and procedures can help ensure that appropriate measures are taken to minimize neurological complications during spinal deformity corrections. Subjectively, surgeons look at radiographs and evaluate the riskiness of the procedure. However, 2 curves of similar magnitude and location can have significantly different risks of neurological deficit during surgery. Whether the curve spans many levels or just a few can significantly influence surgical strategies. Lenke et al have proposed the DAR, which is a measure of curve magnitude per level of deformity.\n\nThe data from 35 pediatric spinal deformity correction procedures with thoracic 3-column osteotomies were reviewed. Measurements from preoperative radiographs were used to calculate the DAR. Binary logistic regression was used to model the relationship between DARs (independent variables) and presence or absence of an intraoperative alert (dependent variable).\n\nIn patients undergoing 3-column osteotomies, sagittal curve magnitude and total curve magnitude were associated with increased incidence of transcranial motor evoked potential changes.

In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity.\n\n100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated.\n\nDifferences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small.

    "orig_answer": "maybe",
    "context": "One of the sites most frequently invaded by gastric cancer is the mesocolon; however, the UICC does not mention this anatomical site as an adjacent structure involved in gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to characterize and classify mesocolon invasion from gastric cancer.\n\nWe examined 806 patients who underwent surgery for advanced gastric carcinoma from 1992 to 2007 at the Department of Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Korea. Among these, patients who showed macroscopically direct invasion into the mesocolon were compared to other patients with advanced gastric cancer.\n\nThe curability, number and extent of nodal metastasis, and the survival of the mesocolon invasion group were significantly worse than these factors in the T3 group. However, the survival of the mesocolon invasion group after curative resection was much better than that of patients who had incurable factors.\n\n",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context describes a study where gastric cancer directly invading the mesocolon has worse prognostic indicators (curability, nodal metastasis, survival) than T3 tumors, yet better post\u2010resection survival than truly incurable cases.

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\n\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\n\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\n\n",

Analyses using multivariable models, controlling for potential confounders and stratifying on propensity score, were performed.\n\nCompared with nonanemic patients, those with severe, moderate, and mild anemia were more likely to have the adverse CO with odds ratios of 1.83 (95% CI 1.05 to 3.19), 2.19 (95 % CI 1.63 to 2.94), and 1.49 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.86), respectively. Patients with a normal hematocrit had a reduced hospital LOS, compared with those with severe, moderate, and mild anemia (p<0.01). A history of cardiovascular disease did not significantly influence these findings.\n\n",

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years).\n\nAll vasoactive drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR.\n\nThere was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and deltaCi (p>0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 respectively, p>0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r = 0.22, p<0.05).

    "orig_question": "Is endometrial polyp formation associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1?",
    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Endometrial polyp is a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, but the etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or TGF-\u03b21, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related to steroid receptor expression.\n\nThis prospective study compared VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) expression.\n\nThe score of VEGF in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative phase (P=0.006). The score of TGF-\u03b21 in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium in proliferative phase (P=0.02); whereas the score of TGF-\u03b21 in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P=0.006) and the secretory phase (P=0.008).

(c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence?\n\nA prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only).\n\nA third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors.

    "context": "Pregnancy induces adaptations in maternal metabolism to meet the increased need for nutrients by the placenta and fetus. Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.\n\nPlasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.\n\nPlasma creatine and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P<0.01), kidney (P<0.01), liver (P<0.01) and heart (P<0.05) mass at term. CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P<0.05) and skeletal muscle (P<0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart (P<0.05) and kidney (P<0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant spiny mice at term. Renal AGAT mRNA (P<0.01) and protein (P<0.05) expression were both significantly up-regulated at term, with decreased expression of AGAT mRNA (<0.01) and GAMT protein (<0.05) observed in the term pregnant heart. Brain AGAT (<0.01) and GAMT (<0.001) mRNA expression were also decreased at term.\n\n",

    "orig_question": "Is prophylactic fixation a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral fragility hip fracture?",
    "orig_answer": "maybe",
    "context": ": A previous hip fracture more than doubles the risk of a contralateral hip fracture. Pharmacologic and environmental interventions to prevent hip fracture have documented poor compliance. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip to prevent contralateral hip fracture.\n\n: A Markov state-transition model was used to evaluate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for unilateral fixation of hip fracture alone (including internal fixation or arthroplasty) compared with unilateral fixation and contralateral prophylactic hip fixation performed at the time of hip fracture or unilateral fixation and bilateral hip pad protection. Prophylactic fixation involved placement of a cephalomedullary nail in the uninjured hip and was initially assumed to have a relative risk of a contralateral fracture of 1%. Health states included good health, surgery-related complications requiring a second operation (infection, osteonecrosis, nonunion, and malunion), fracture of the uninjured hip, and death. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimated as cost per QALY gained in 2006 US dollars with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per QALY gained considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of patient age, annual mortality and complication rates, intervention effectiveness, utilities, and costs on the value of prophylactic fixation.\n\n: In the baseline analysis, in a 79-year-old woman, prophylactic fixation was not found to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $142,795/QALY). However, prophylactic fixation was found to be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in: 1) women 71 to 75 years old who had 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture; and 2) women younger than age 70 years. Cost-effectiveness was greater when the additional costs of prophylaxis were less than $6000. However, for most analyses, the success of prophylactic fixation was highly sensitive to the effectiveness and the relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure.\n\n",

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "The identification of the most suspect enhancing part of a lesion is regarded as a major diagnostic criterion in dynamic magnetic resonance mammography. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software allows the semi-automatic analysis of the kinetic characteristics of complete enhancing lesions, providing additional information about lesion vasculature. The diagnostic value of this information has not yet been quantified.\n\nConsecutive patients from routine diagnostic studies (1.5 T, 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine, dynamic gradient-echo sequences at 1-minute intervals) were analyzed prospectively using CAD. Dynamic sequences were processed and reduced to a parametric map. Curve types were classified by initial signal increase (not significant, intermediate, and strong) and the delayed time course of signal intensity (continuous, plateau, and washout). Lesion enhancement was measured using CAD. The most suspect curve, the curve-type distribution percentage, and combined dynamic data were compared. Statistical analysis included logistic regression analysis and receiver-operating characteristic analysis.\n\nFifty-one patients with 46 malignant and 44 benign lesions were enrolled. On receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the most suspect curve showed diagnostic accuracy of 76.7 +/- 5%. In comparison, the curve-type distribution percentage demonstrated accuracy of 80.2 +/- 4.9%. Combined dynamic data had the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3 +/- 4.2%). These differences did not achieve statistical significance. With appropriate cutoff values, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were found to be 80.4% and 72.7% for the most suspect curve, 76.1% and 83.6% for the curve-type distribution percentage, and 78.3% and 84.5% for both parameters.\n\n",

Although past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada.\n\nTwo separate telephone surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles.

    "context": "Current guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in women recommend empiric therapy with antibiotics for which local resistance rates do not exceed 10-20%. We hypothesized that resistance rates of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones may have surpassed this level in older women in the Israeli community setting.\n\nTo identify age groups of women in which fluoroquinolones may no longer be appropriate for empiric treatment of UTI.\n\nResistance rates for ofloxacin were calculated for all cases of uncomplicated UTI diagnosed during the first 5 months of 2005 in a managed care organization (MCO) in Israel, in community-dwelling women aged 41-75 years. The women were without risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance. Uncomplicated UTI was diagnosed with a urine culture positive for E. coli. The data set was stratified for age, using 5 year intervals, and stratum-specific resistance rates (% and 95% CI) were calculated. These data were analyzed to identify age groups in which resistance rates have surpassed 10%.\n\nThe data from 1291 urine cultures were included. The crude resistance rate to ofloxacin was 8.7% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.2). Resistance was lowest among the youngest (aged 41-50 y) women (3.2%; 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18), approached 10% in women aged 51-55 years (7.1%; 95% CI 3.4 to 10.9), and reached 19.86% (95% CI 13.2 to 26.5) among the oldest women (aged 56-75 y).\n\n",

We aimed to compare performance of the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) with the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator in three resuscitation models.\n\nFive experienced clinicians delivered targeted ventilation to three lung models differing in compliance, delivery pressures and inflation rates; Preterm (0.5\u2005mL/cmH2O, 25/5 cmH2O, 60 per minute), Term (3\u2005mL/cmH2O, 30/5 cmH2O, 40 per minute) and Infant (9\u2005mL/cmH2O, 35/5 cmH2O, 30 per minute). The Neopuff was examined with three gas inflow rates (5 litres per minute (LPM), 10 LPM and 15 LPM) and the Ambu with no gas inflow.\n\n3309 inflations were collected and analysed with analysis of variance for repeated measures.

However, not everyone is equally vulnerable to other people's drinking, and it is important to unravel which factors underlie these individual differences. This study focuses on the role of psychosocial stress in attempting to explain individual differences in the propensity to imitate alcohol consumption.\n\nWith a 2 (confederate's drinking condition: alcohol vs. soda) \u00d7 2 (participant's stress condition: stress vs. no stress) experimental design, we tested whether the tendency to imitate other people's drinking was related to participants' induced stress levels. The young male adults (N = 106) were randomly assigned to each of the conditions. In each session, directly after the stress or no-stress period, confederates and participants entered a bar laboratory where we observed their drinking behavior. Prior to entering the session, confederates were instructed to drink alcohol or soda.\n\nParticipants in both stress and no-stress conditions consumed substantially more alcohol when confederates drank alcohol than when they drank soda.

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "There is controversy surrounding the optimal management of the testicular remnant associated with the vanishing testes syndrome. Some urologists advocate the need for surgical exploration, whereas others believe this is unnecessary. These differing opinions are based on the variable reports of viable germ cell elements found within the testicular remnants. To better understand the pathology associated with this syndrome and the need for surgical management, we reviewed our experience regarding the incidence of viable germ cell elements within the testicular remnant.\n\nAn institutional review board-approved, retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing exploration for a nonpalpable testis at Eastern Virginia Medical School and Geisinger Medical Center between 1994 and 2006. Patients who were found to have spermatic vessels and a vas deferens exiting a closed internal inguinal ring were included in this analysis.\n\nFifty-six patients underwent removal of the testicular remnant. Patient age ranged from 11 to 216 months. In 8 of the specimens (14%), we identified viable germ cell elements. In an additional 4 patients (7%), we identified seminiferous tubules without germ cell elements.\n\n",

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible.\n\nFifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%.\n\nOf the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients.

Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant.AIM: To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease.\n\nThe case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke: peripheral vascular disease (PVD), carotid bruit, diabetes mellitus, age>70 years and/or history of cerebrovascular disease. Prevalence of carotid stenosis detected by ultrasonography, surgical management and perioperative stroke rates were determined in each group.\n\nOverall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01).\n\n",

    "context": "The gap between evidence-based treatments and routine care has been well established. Findings from the Sequenced Treatments Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) emphasized the importance of measurement-based care for the treatment of depression as a key ingredient for achieving response and remission; yet measurement-based care approaches are not commonly used in clinical practice.\n\nThe Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for monitoring depression severity was introduced in 19 diverse psychiatric practices. During the one-year course of the project the helpfulness and feasibility of implementation of PHQ-9 in these psychiatric practices were studied. The project was modeled after the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series. Two of the 19 practices dropped out during the course of the project.\n\nBy the conclusion of the study, all remaining 17 practices had adopted PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care in their practice. On the basis of responses from 17 psychiatrists from those practices, PHQ-9 scores influenced clinical decision making for 93% of 6,096 patient contacts. With the additional information gained from the PHQ-9 score, one or more treatment changes occurred during 40% of these clinical contacts. Changing the dosage of antidepressant medication and adding another medication were the most common treatment changes recorded by psychiatrists, followed by starting or increasing psychotherapy and by switching or initiating antidepressants. In 3% of the patient contacts, using the PHQ-9 led to additional suicide risk assessment.\n\n",

After the clinical evaluation, pelvic ultrasonography (US) was performed by 2 separate radiologists. The bladder capacity and the transverse rectal diameter were measured with a full bladder. Then the rectal diameter and rectal anterior wall thickness were measured, and the presence of fecal load in the rectum and sigmoid colon was recorded with an empty bladder. The examination and ultrasound were repeated after treatment for a month in these patients.\n\nComparison of the US measurements of the 2 radiologists performing the US tests did not show any interobserver difference (r = 0.981; P<.001).

    "context": "Coronary atherosclerotic burden is excessive in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor for both death and myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the prevalence of complex coronary lesions, such as bifurcation and ostial lesions, is different in diabetics from nondiabetics.\n\nThe aim of present study was to investigate the prevalence of these lesions in patients with DM.\n\nOne thousand fourteen consecutive patients (mean age 61.3+/-10.7 years) were investigated. Coronary angiograms were examined for bifurcation and ostial lesions using a digital quantitative system. Patients were classified as diabetic (n=281) or nondiabetic (n=733).\n\nPatient mean age, and rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (P<0.0001), although smoking was significantly lower (P=0.001). Reasons for coronary angiography and treatment were comparable between the two groups. The prevalence of bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions was significantly greater in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (9.8% versus 4.3% [P=0.001] and 38.4% versus 29.2% [P=0.003]in the diabetic group versus the nondiabetic group). The presence of DM and greater age were found to be independent predictors for bifurcation lesions (OR=2.27 [P=0.004] and OR=1.03 [P=0.01], for DM and age, respectively) and ostial lesions (OR=1.40 [P=0.027] and OR=1.02 [P=0.001], for DM and age, respectively) in multivariate analysis.\n\n",

    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\n\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.\n\n",

    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "To provide insight into the factors by which obesity in itself may directly lead to early arterial damage, we aimed to determine early sonographic markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males.\n\nThirty-five young obese males and 23 age-matched healthy male volunteers were recruited into the study. Common carotid artery pulsatility index and resistance index were calculated from blood flow velocities curves obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography.\n\nThe mean pulsatility index, resistance index, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, plasma fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically higher in obese subjects than in healthy controls.\n\n",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context describes a study assessing early sonographic indicators of vascular dysfunction in young obese males by measuring common carotid artery pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI). The central finding is that both PI and RI are significantly elevated in obese subjects compared to healthy, age-matched controls. This supports the idea that increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes serve as early markers of vascular abnormalities in obesity.  \nKey concepts:  \n- Sonographic measurement of carotid PI and RI  \n- Comparison of obese versus non-obese young males  \n- Significantly higher PI and RI in obesity implies early arterial damage  \nGiven the directness of the original yes/no question, the rephrased question should retain its confirmatory nature while embedding sufficient context for a standalone understanding.  \nDifficulty: 3/10 \u2013 requires recognition of elevated vascular indices as early dysfunction markers.  \nNo irrelevant content identified.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In a study comparing 35 young obese males with 23 healthy controls, researchers found that the obese group had significantly higher common carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes.

    "orig_question": "Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?",
    "orig_answer": "yes",
    "context": "Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis involving mainly medium-sized arteries and, rarely, small-sized arteries. The diagnosis is principally based on clinical exams, biopsy of an affected organ, and/or arteriography of renal or mesenteric arteries. Once diagnosed, immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, are generally introduced as soon as possible. Whether spontaneous remission of PAN occurs is therefore largely unknown.\n\nWe describe the case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with a 4-day-history of intense pain in her left flank, hypertension, fever, microscopic hematuria, and acute renal failure. Contrast-enhanced renal ultrasound strongly suggested bilateral renal infarction. Medical history and an extensive workup allowed to exclude systemic embolism, recreational drug abuse, cardiac arrhythmias, and thrombophilia. A possible diagnosis of PAN was considered; however, within 2 weeks of admission, spontaneous remission of her clinical and biological symptoms occurred without the use of any immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, 3 months later, renal arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of PAN. The patient remains free of symptoms 1 year after initial presentation.\n\n",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context explains that PAN normally requires prompt immunosuppressive therapy and that spontaneous remission had been largely undocumented until a specific case. The central idea is whether PAN can remit without treatment. The new question must be self-contained, mentioning necessary background (typical therapy) and asking about spontaneous remission. Difficulty is moderate (3/10) because it tests recall of a key point. The correct answer is \"Yes,\" supported by the case of a patient who recovered within two weeks in the absence of immunosuppressive treatment.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Considering that polyarteritis nodosa typically calls for early administration of immunosuppressive agents, is it possible for the disease to resolve on its own without such treatment?\n\nExplanation: Although immunosuppressive therapy is generally introduced as soon as PAN is diagnosed, documented cases\u2014such as one patient whose clinical and laboratory abnormalities subsided within two weeks without immunosuppressive drugs\u2014confirm that spontaneous remission can occur.\n\nCorrect Answer: Yes\n</output_format>",

    "orig_question": "Does increasing blood pH stimulate protein synthesis in dialysis patients?",
    "orig_answer": "no",
    "context": "Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters.\n\nEight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +/-1.6 mmol/l. The fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique.\n\nOral NaHCO(3 )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +/- 3.4 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.6 mmol/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041). The FSR of muscle protein and the FSR of albumin did not change significantly (muscle protein: 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5% per day, p = 0.39; albumin: 8.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 8.6 +/- 2.5% per day, p = 0.31). Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 decreased significantly (33.4 +/- 21.3 vs. 25.4 +/- 12.3 nmol/l; p = 0.028), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin and free triiodothyronine did not change significantly and nutritional parameters showed no improvement.\n\n",

In this study, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes.\n\nWe used an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the therapists and emerging themes were coded.\n\nWhen initial level of severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald&Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska,&Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists. The trainer, blind to the results, identified the following characteristics and actions of effective therapists: effectively addressing patient avoidance, language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance.\n\n",
