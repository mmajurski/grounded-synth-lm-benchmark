[PAR] History [PAR] Homer was relying on a Christmas bonus to buy presents, but didn't get it. He was relying on this bonus because the jar of Christmas money that Marge accumulates for the family's Christmas treats was disposed of to pay for the removal of a tattoo that Bart got on his arm. Homer took the small amount of Christmas money he made working as Santa Claus at the Springfield Mall and bet it at the dog track. He had inside information on what dog was going to win, but instead bet on the \"long shot,\" Santa's Little Helper, believing his name to be a sign. Santa's Little Helper finished last (apparently, it was the latest in a long string of last-place finishes), and his frustrated owner abandoned him. Homer and Bart brought him home, and everyone was so happy with him that it was a merry Christmas after all. [1] [PAR] Snowball II , Maggie and Santa's Little Helper together for a picture [PAR] Sometimes, Santa's Little Helper can be seen chewing on the newspaper and other objects in the Simpson's household (sometimes ignored or tolerated by the family), tearing up the furniture, digging holes in the backyard and eating food from the living room table. It is stated that Homer and Santa's Little Helper's birthdays are on the same day. [2] [PAR] With a few exceptions, Santa's Little Helper doesn't make any sound that resembles a bark. However, he does have an ability to think just like a person. Once, he made a sound similar to \"chewy\", and Homer writes it down in his review, amazed that the dog spoke English. [3] He is also shown to have ridden a circus ball on his hind legs and speak the phrase 'We love... you!' in an attempt to be given some attention from the Simpson family. [4] In addition, he was mascot of Duff Beer , and was known as Suds McDuff (a reference to a similar, real life mascot Spuds MacKenzie). [5] [PAR] Santa's Little Helper licking Bart [PAR] Santa's Little Helper's life with the Simpsons is not always easy. Due to his disobedience and destructive behavior nearly caused the Simpson family to give him away, but he passed an obedience class, thus he could stay. [6] Santa's Little Helper almost passed away from gastric torsion (referred to in the show as a \"twisting of the stomach\") because Homer initially couldn't afford $750 for the required operation. [7] He also broke two legs when Bart's treehouse was demolished by Mr. Burns ' slanted oil well drill (The latter of which caused Bart Simpson to hate Mr. Burns immensely). [8] Santa's Little Helper is sometimes a bad dog. [PAR] At one time, Santa's Little Helper was shortly abandoned by Bart for Laddie , a purebred and very well-trained dog he bought from a mail-order catalog together with various other expensive gifts and gadgets. To do that, Bart used a credit card he applied for under the name of his dog, yet the credit card company misread the form and issued a card to Mr. \"Santos L. Halper\". Laddie learned many tricks that Santa's Little Helper was completely unable to perform (most notably a back flip, CPR and using a toilet). The Simpson family nearly forgot about their old pet, and Bart eventually gave him away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tried to get Santa's Little Helper back. When he finally found him, Santa's Little Helper was serving as a guide dog for a blind man named Mr. Mitchell, but eventually chose to return to his former owner, Bart.

It highlights the circumstances leading to the abandonment\u2014Homer\u2019s financial stress and misplaced faith in the dog\u2019s name as a sign\u2014which results in disappointment and rejection. However, the family\u2019s decision to bring Santa\u2019s Little Helper home transforms their Christmas into a joyful occasion, indicating a shift in family dynamics from despair to happiness. The passage also touches on the dog\u2019s behavioral challenges and moments of disobedience, reflecting tensions within the family, yet ultimately underscores loyalty and reconciliation, especially in the episode where Bart temporarily replaces Santa\u2019s Little Helper with Laddie but returns to the original dog out of guilt and emotional connection.

Together they had ten illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname FitzClarence. [PAR] Early life [PAR] She was born Dorothea (sometimes called Dorothy or Dora) Bland near Waterford, Ireland, the daughter of Francis Bland (d. 1778) and his mistress, Grace Phillips. She was the paternal granddaughter of Nathaneal Bland (d. 1760), Vicar General of Ardfert and Aghada, and Judge of the Prerogative Court of Dublin, Ireland, and his wife Lucy (n\u00e9e Heaton). [PAR] In 1774, when she was 13, Dorothea's father, who worked as a stagehand, abandoned the family to marry an Irish actress. Though he continued to support the family by sending them meagre sums of money, they were poor and Dorothea had to go to work to help support her four siblings. Her mother, an actress by profession, saw potential in Dorothea and put her on the stage. [PAR] Stage life and early relationships [PAR] She became a famous actress of the day and was said to have the most beautiful legs ever seen on the stage. Audiences enjoyed her performances in breeches roles. She assumed the name \"Mrs. Jordan\", because it was slightly more respectable for a married woman to be on the stage. In fact, there was no \"Mr. Jordan\" and Dorothea Bland never married. Some sources state that the name and title were taken to conceal an early pregnancy. She had an affair with her first boss, Richard Daly, the manager of the Theatre Royal, Cork, who was married, and had an illegitimate daughter, Frances (b. 1782 Dublin), at age 20. [PAR] In England, she had a short lived affair with an army Lieutenant, Charles Doyne, who proposed marriage. But she turned him down and went to work for the theatre company operated by Tate Wilkinson. It was at this point she adopted the name \"Mrs. Jordan\" \u2013 a reference to her escape across the Irish Sea, likened to the River Jordan. [PAR] Shortly after her affair with Wilkinson was over, she began an affair with George Inchbald, the male lead in the Wilkinson company. According to Claire Tomalin, Dorothea's biographer, Dorothea would have married Inchbald, so greatly was she in love with him, but that he never asked. Broken-hearted, she left him in 1786 to begin an affair with Sir Richard Ford, a police magistrate and a lawyer. She moved in with Ford when he promised to marry her. They had three children, a short lived son and two daughters. She left him to begin her affair with the Duke of Clarence, once she realised that Ford was never going to marry her. [PAR] Relationship with William IV [PAR] Pretty, witty and intelligent, Jordan soon came to the attention of wealthy men. She became the mistress of William, Duke of Clarence, later King William IV, in 1791, living with him at Bushy House, and seemed to have not bothered herself with politics or the political intrigues that often went on behind the scenes in royal courts. She continued her acting career, and made public appearances with the Duke when necessary.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed historical account of Dorothea Jordan\u2019s life, focusing primarily on her dual identity as a celebrated Anglo-Irish actress and as the long-term mistress of William, Duke of Clarence (later King William IV). It highlights the complexities of her public persona (\"Mrs. Jordan\" stage name) alongside her private life, including her relationships, children, and social positioning. The text emphasizes how she maintained a public acting career despite her intimate relationship with a royal figure, illustrating a rare balancing act between public celebrity and private liaison in a period when social norms were rigid.\n\nKey nuanced themes include:\n- The strategic adoption of a stage name to craft a respectable public identity despite personal scandals.\n- The tension between personal relationships and societal expectations, especially given her illegitimate children with a royal.\n- The intersection of gender, class, and performance, showing how Dorothea navigated public visibility and private discretion.\n- The socio-political implications of being a royal mistress for two decades, including her lack of involvement in court politics despite proximity to power.\n- The impact of her personal choices on her legacy and on the status of her children.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the understanding of 18th-century social mores, the role of women in theatre and society, and the political context of royal mistresses.\n\nThe complexity rating is 9/10 because the question must require synthesis of historical, social, and gender studies perspectives to fully grasp Dorothea Jordan\u2019s dual roles.\n\nThe question will invite critical reflection on how Dorothea managed or negotiated her public and private identities, going beyond mere biographical facts to analyze the implications of her dual existence on her career, social standing, and legacy. This requires deep understanding of the societal constraints and opportunities of her era.\n\nThus, the question will probe the expert\u2019s ability to analyze the intricate balance between Dorothea's public theatrical persona and her private role as a royal mistress, including the strategies she employed and the broader social significance.\n\nThis will challenge experts to consider the multi-dimensionality of her identity and the interplay between public performance and private relationships in historical context.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How did Dorothea Jordan strategically balance her public identity as a celebrated actress with her private role as the long-term mistress of the future King William IV, and what does this reveal about her navigation of 18th-century social and gender norms?\n\nA: By adopting the stage name \"Mrs. Jordan\" to create a respectable public persona despite her unmarried status, continuing her acting career openly, and making selective public appearances with the Duke, she maintained a controlled separation of her theatrical and private lives, reflecting a sophisticated negotiation of the era\u2019s rigid gender and class expectations.\n\nB: By completely withdrawing from public life and the stage upon her relationship with William IV becoming known, she conformed to societal expectations that mistresses remain hidden, thus protecting both her reputation and the Duke\u2019s.\n\nC: By openly declaring her relationship with the Duke and using her status to engage actively in political intrigues at the royal court, she transformed the role of a mistress into one of public political influence and power.\n\nD: By marrying multiple times to different men while secretly maintaining her relationship with the Duke, she used legal marriage as a shield to preserve respectability in both public and private spheres.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because Dorothea adopted the name \"Mrs. Jordan\" to lend respectability to her unmarried status and continued her public acting career while privately living with the Duke and making occasional joint appearances, thereby skillfully managing her dual identities within the strict social norms of 18th-century Britain.

The show is set in a bar named Cheers (named after its real life counterpart) in Boston, Massachusetts, where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize.  The show's main theme song, written and performed by Gary Portnoy, and co-written with Judy Hart Angelo, lent its famous refrain \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" as the show's tagline.  [PAR] After premiering on September 30, 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked almost last in ratings for its premiere (74th out of 77 shows). Cheers, however, eventually became a highly rated television show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at number one. The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night \"Must See TV\" lineup. Its widely watched series finale was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 270 episodes have been successfully syndicated worldwide.  Nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series for all eleven of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations.

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry. With no reserves, Tallard's line broke and his troops began fleeing towards H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. They were joined in their flight by the Bavarians from Lutzingen. [PAR] Trapped in Blenheim, Cl\u00e9rambault's men continued the fight until 9:00 PM when over 10,000 of them surrendered. As the French fled southwest, a group of Hessian troops managed to capture Marshall Tallard, who was to spend the next seven years in captivity in England. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Aftermath & Impact: [PAR] In the fighting at Blenheim, the Allies lost 4,542 killed and 7,942 wounded, while the French and Bavarians suffered approximately 20,000 killed and wounded as well as 14,190 captured. The Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim ended the French threat to Vienna and removed the aura of invincibility that surrounded the armies of Louis XIV. The battle was a turning point in the War of Spanish Succession, ultimately leading to the Grand Alliance's victory and an end of French hegemony over Europe.",

Central to the narrative is the capture of Marshall Tallard, the French commander, by Hessian troops. This event is embedded within a broader description of the battle dynamics: French forces were positioned defensively with a reserve force that was wasted due to a panic-induced order, allowing the Allies under Marlborough and Prince Eug\u00e8ne to break the French center and rout their infantry.\n\nThe capture of Tallard is presented as both a symbolic and practical blow to the French. Practically, it represents the loss of the French commander who then spent seven years as a captive in England, indicating a severe disruption of French command structure. Symbolically, Tallard's capture, alongside the massive casualties and prisoners taken, shattered the French aura of invincibility under Louis XIV, marking a turning point in the war.\n\nImplicitly, the text suggests that Tallard's capture contributed to a significant morale decline in French forces and demonstrated Allied superiority, influencing the course of the war and European power balance. The capture is not isolated but is tied to the collapse of the French line following the loss of their reserves and cavalry, underscoring the interconnectedness of leadership, morale, and battlefield outcomes.\n\nThe difficulty level is high (8/10) because the question requires synthesis of tactical details, understanding the command implications, and interpreting symbolic morale effects beyond mere factual recall.\n\nThe planned question aims to probe understanding of both the immediate military consequences of Tallard's capture and its broader psychological and strategic impact on French morale and command during the war, encouraging reflection on how leadership capture can alter a conflict's trajectory.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How did the capture of Marshall Tallard at the Battle of Blenheim simultaneously undermine French military command effectiveness and symbolic morale, thereby altering the strategic trajectory of the War of Spanish Succession?\nA: It removed the French reserve commander, weakening frontline coordination but had little effect on overall French morale or strategic position.\nB: It deprived the French army of its primary commander, leading to disorganized retreat and shattered morale, symbolizing the end of French invincibility and shifting the war's momentum to the Allies.\nC: It was a minor event overshadowed by heavy French casualties, with Tallard\u2019s capture having negligible impact on French command or morale.\nD: It resulted in the French immediately negotiating peace due to loss of leadership, ending the war swiftly in favor of the Allies.\n\nExplanation: The capture of Marshall Tallard directly removed the French commander from the battlefield, causing disorganization and contributing to the collapse of French forces.

[PAR] Stock footage courtesy The WPA Film Library [PAR] At the end of the war in Europe, Macmillan was secretary of state for air in Churchill\u2019s \u201ccaretaker\u201d government (May\u2013July 1945). After the Conservatives regained power in 1951, he was successively appointed minister of housing and local government (October 1951) and minister of defense (October 1954) by Churchill and then served as foreign secretary (April\u2013December 1955) and chancellor of the exchequer (1955\u201357) under Sir Anthony Eden . He was appointed prime minister on Jan. 10, 1957, following the resignation of Eden in the wake of the Suez crisis, and was elected leader of the Conservative Party 12 days later. [PAR] Macmillan immediately had to deal with a national shortage of money, and his chancellor of the exchequer, Peter Thorneycroft, resigned (January 1958) in protest against government spending. Macmillan worked to improve British-U.S. relations, which had been strained by the Suez crisis, and his old partnership with General, now President, Eisenhower was helpful in this regard. Macmillan himself supervised the conduct of foreign policy as prime minister. He had several conferences with presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy , and he visited Nikita S. Khrushchev in Moscow (February 1959). At home, Macmillan gave firm support to Britain\u2019s array of postwar social programs. He led the Conservative Party to a resounding victory in the 1959 general election by effectively contrasting Britain\u2019s prewar unemployment with its postwar full employment under the slogan \u201cYou\u2019ve never had it so good.\u201d [PAR] Britannica Stories [PAR] Ringling Bros. Folds Its Tent [PAR] The Nassau agreement (December 1962) between Macmillan and Kennedy, that the United States should furnish nuclear missiles for British submarines, enraged Charles de Gaulle, who then was head of the French state and who insisted on a Europe uncontrolled by the United States. The subsequent French veto (Jan. 29, 1963) of Great Britain\u2019s entry into the European Economic Community was a severe blow to Macmillan. For most of his term Macmillan had been held in high esteem by his party. But Britain\u2019s adverse balance of payments led the government to impose a wage freeze and other deflationary measures from 1961 on, and this caused Macmillan\u2019s government to lose popularity. Another setback was an apparent Soviet espionage attempt involving John Profumo , the secretary of state for war, which ended in the latter\u2019s resignation (June 1963). Macmillan\u2019s reputation was partly rehabilitated by the successful negotiations (July 1963)",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Last of the Summer WineLast of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke that was originally broadcast on the BBC. Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series. Last of the Summer Wine inspired other adaptations, including a television prequel,  several novelisations,  and stage adaptations.  [PAR] Production [PAR] History and development [PAR]",

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. [PAR] Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623.

[PAR] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390).

[PAR] The Simpsons has received widespread critical acclaim, especially for the \"Golden Age\" of approximately its first ten seasons. Time magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,  and The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\".   On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award.

They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Richard NixonRichard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913\u00a0\u2013 April 22, 1994) was the 37th President of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974 when he became the only U.S. president to resign the office. Nixon had previously served as a U.S. Representative and Senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961. [PAR] Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. After completing his undergraduate studies at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II. Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962. In 1968 he ran again for the presidency and was elected when he defeated Hubert Humphrey. [PAR] Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home. At the same time, he ended military draft. Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated d\u00e9tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington to the states. He imposed wage and price controls for a period of ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race. He was reelected by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history in 1972, when he defeated George McGovern. [PAR] The year 1973 saw an Arab oil embargo, gasoline rationing, and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal. The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In retirement, Nixon's work writing several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.  [PAR] Early life  [PAR] Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, in a house his father built. He was the son of Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith; Nixon's upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time, such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909\u201333), Donald (1914\u201387), Arthur (1918\u201325), and Edward (born 1930). Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary England; Richard, for example, was named after Richard the Lionheart.  [PAR] Nixon's early life was marked by hardship, and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood: \"We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it\". The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved to Whittier, California. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station. Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness. At the age of twelve, Richard was found to have a spot on his lung and, with a family history of tuberculosis, he was forbidden to play sports. Eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.",

This event encapsulates the absurdity and indifference of bureaucratic systems in a cosmic scale, reflecting themes of arbitrary authority, existential insignificance, and the clash between mundane human concerns and vast impersonal cosmic orders. The demolition serves both as a plot catalyst and a satirical commentary on overreaching bureaucracy that disregards individual lives and planetary significance for bureaucratic convenience.

Central ideas include the Poet Laureate\u2019s official status as a member of the royal household, the expectation to compose poetry for royal and national occasions, and the method of appointment by the monarch based on the Prime Minister\u2019s recommendations. The lifetime tenure is significant, as it ties the poet\u2019s public duties and symbolic representation directly to the reigning monarch and national identity over potentially extended periods. The laureateship\u2019s origins in ancient Roman laurel symbolism underscore the honorific and ceremonial nature of the position. Nuanced themes emerge around the political and religious contexts influencing appointments (e.g., Dryden\u2019s removal due to allegiance issues and Shadwell\u2019s replacement based on religious affiliation), reflecting the intertwining of poetry, politics, and monarchy. The lifetime appointment can imply both prestige and burden, as poets may be compelled to produce official verses regardless of personal inclination or changing political climates, affecting their artistic freedom and legacy.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the understanding that the Poet Laureate\u2019s role is both a cultural and political symbol, and the lifetime nature of the role institutionalizes this symbolic function for continuity.

[PAR] Since those early days the course and fences have undergone many changes. Most recently the wooden stakes at the core of the fences have been replaced with flexible plastic to reduce the risk of horses and jockeys getting injured. The starting line has also moved further away from the main stand as this helps the horses remain calmer in the moments before the off. [PAR] These changes haven\u2019t effected the essence of the race, which still remains the one of the toughest\u00a0tests of horse and rider in the world. Forty horses line up at the starting tape and around 60% of the entrants will not complete the race, which is four and a half miles\u00a0long and has thirty fence jumps. [PAR] Aintree [PAR] Aintree\u00a0is the home of the Grand National and apart from a couple of years during the first world war, the race has always taken place at the course, which is located just five miles from the centre of Liverpool. Well served by public transport and a train station, the course is modern and offers a wide range of facilities. The Grand National is just one of many race\u00a0meetings that take place during the National Hunt season although not all meetings and races are run over the National course. [PAR] Getting to Aintree is very easy from all parts of the United Kingdom. Liverpool has excellent rail links, motorway access\u00a0and is served by John Lennon Airport. Queues on the day of the Grand National can build up on the roads surrounding the course but this is to be expected for such a popular sporting occasion. Around 70,000 racing fans will\u00a0watch the race live making it one of the biggest sporting events in the calendar. [PAR] Course [PAR] The Grand National course is 4 miles and 4 furlongs long. The horses encounter 16 different fences\u00a0with varying degrees of height and width. Riders must navigate two circuits of the course (missing out fences 15 & 16 on the second circuit)\u00a0before turning for\u00a0the home straight which is the longest run-in of any UK racecourse. [PAR] The Grand National is the longest race in the UK but it\u2019s the difficulty for the fences that provide the real challenge\u00a0to horse and rider. Just a\u00a0mention of the fences Becher\u2019s Brook, The Chair and the Canal Turn make a jockey\u2019s blood run cold. [PAR] Often called the \u2018Original Extreme Sport\u2019\u00a0steeplechase races originated in Ireland. Legend has it that the\u00a0first race\u00a0was\u00a0between Cornelius O\u2019Callaghan and Edmund Blake as they raced from\u00a0Buttevant Church to St. Leger Church, or from steeple to steeple, hence the term steeplechase. Those original cross country races are now replicated on racecourses across England and Ireland. However, the Aintree course is arguably the toughest of all. Jockeys\u00a0no longer have to jump a stone wall at Aintree or cross the ploughed field, but the water jumps, brooks and ditches still feature on many of its\u00a0fences. [PAR] Famous Fences [PAR] THE GRAND NATIONAL FENCES [PAR] Few races can claim to have famous fences, maybe with the exception of the infamous \u2018Taxis\u2019 fence in the Velk\u00e1 pardubick\u00e1, no other race can rival the Grand National for fearsome jumps. [PAR] Of the 16 fences which make up the National course six of the\u00a0jumps have become famous in their own right. Becher\u2019s Brook, Valentines\u2019 Brook, The Chair, Canal Turn and Foinavon are names which are known throughout the world. These fences are woven into the very fabric of the Grand National race. [PAR] Becher\u2019s Brook [PAR] Becher\u2019s Brook is the the 6th and 22nd fence in the Grand National. Standing at 4ft 10 inches the fence has a fearsome reputation due to the fact that the landing side of the fence is 10 inches lower than the take",

The narrator of the novel is Ishmael , a sailor on the Pequod who undertakes the journey out of his affection for the sea. [PAR] Moby Dick begins with Ishmael's arrival in New Bedford as he travels toward Nantucket. He rests at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, where he meets Queequeg , a harpooner from New Zealand who will also sail on the Pequod. Although Queequeg appears dangerous, he and Ishmael must share a bed together and the narrator quickly grows fond of the somewhat uncivilized harpooner. Queequeg is actually the son of a High Chief who left New Zealand because of his desire to learn among Christians. The next day, Ishmael attends a church service and listens to a sermon by Father Mapple , a renowned preacher who delivers a sermon considering Jonah and the whale that concludes that the tale is a lesson to preacher Truth in the face of Falsehood. [PAR] On a schooner to Nantucket, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a local bumpkin who mocks Queequeg. However, when this bumpkin is swept overboard, Queequeg saves him. In Nantucket, Queequeg and Ishmael choose between three ships for a year journey, and decide upon the Pequod. The Captain of the Pequod, Peleg , is now retired, and merely owns the boat with another Quaker, Bildad . Peleg tells them of the new captain, Ahab, and immediately describes him as a grand and ungodly man. Before leaving for their voyage, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a stranger named Elijah who predicts disaster on their journey. Before leaving on the Pequod, Elijah again predicts disaster. [PAR] Ishmael and Queequeg board the Pequod, where Captain Ahab is still unseen, secluded in his own cabin. Peleg and Bildad consult with Starbuck , the first mate. He is a Quaker and a Nantucket native who is quite practical. The second mate is Stubb , a Cape Cod native with a more jovial and carefree attitude. The third is Flask , a Martha's Vineyard native with a pugnacious attitude. Melville introduces the rest of the crew, including the Indian harpooner Tashtego , the African harpooner Daggoo . [PAR] Several days into the voyage, Ahab finally appears as a man seemingly made of bronze who stands on an ivory leg fashioned from whalebone. He eventually gets into a violent argument with Stubb when the second mate makes a joke at Ahab's expense, and kicks him. This leads Stubb to dream of kicking Ahab's ivory leg off, but Flask claims that the kick from Ahab is a sign of honor. [PAR] At last, Ahab tells the crew of the Pequod to look for a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow: Moby Dick, the legendary whale that took Ahab's leg. Starbuck tells Ahab that his obsession with Moby Dick is madness, but Ahab claims that all things are masks and there is some unknown reasoning behind that mask that man must strike through. For Ahab, Moby Dick is that mask. Ahab himself seems to recognize his own madness. Starbuck begins to worry that the ship is overmatched by the mad captain and knows that he will see an impious end to Ahab. [PAR] While Queequeg and Ishmael weave a sword-mat for lashing to their boat, the Pequod soon comes upon a whale and Ahab orders his crew to their boats. Ahab orders his special crew, which Ishmael compares to \"phantoms,\" to their boats. The crew attacks a whale and Queequeg does strike it, but this is insufficient to kill it. Among the \"phantoms\" in the boat is Fedallah , a sinister Parsee. [PAR] After passing the Cape of Good Hope, the Pequod comes across the Goney (Albatross), another ship on its voyage. Ahab asks whether they have seen Moby Dick as the ships pass one another, but Ahab cannot hear his answer. The mere passing of the ships is unorthodox behavior, for ships will generally have a 'gam,",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed summary of Herman Melville\u2019s \"Moby Dick,\" focusing especially on the contrasting characters of Captain Ahab and Starbuck aboard the Pequod. Ahab is portrayed as a monomaniacal figure driven by obsession and madness to hunt the white whale Moby Dick, which had previously maimed him. Starbuck, the first mate, is depicted as practical, reasonable, and morally grounded\u2014a Quaker who openly challenges Ahab's dangerous obsession. The tension between them embodies the novel\u2019s central conflict between madness and reason, obsession and restraint. The summary highlights Ahab's recognition of his own madness and Starbuck\u2019s fear of the captain\u2019s impious fate. This dynamic is critical as it represents a broader philosophical struggle about human will, fate, and the limits of reason.\n\nImplicitly, the text suggests a thematic exploration of masks and hidden meanings\u2014Ahab\u2019s idea that all things are masks, and the whale is the ultimate mask that must be struck through.

The summary also alludes to the symbolic roles of the crew members and their diverse backgrounds, which enrich the narrative\u2019s exploration of human nature and worldview clashes.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. The question must probe the symbolic and thematic significance of the Ahab-Starbuck conflict beyond surface-level character traits, requiring nuanced understanding of Melville\u2019s philosophical and psychological intentions.\n\nThe question will challenge experts to analyze how the contrasting worldviews of Ahab and Starbuck reflect the novel\u2019s deeper tensions between madness and reason, and what this implies about human nature and fate. It invites reflection on how their conflict embodies a broader metaphysical struggle rather than merely a personal rivalry.\n\nThought process: The question should not merely ask to identify traits but to interpret the symbolic meaning and philosophical implications of their conflict. It should require synthesis of character analysis, thematic insight, and understanding of Melville\u2019s use of symbolism (masks, madness, reason).

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the mathematical and design aspects of dice, focusing on permutations of dice faces, symmetries (rotations and reflections), and the standard arrangement of numbers on dice with opposite sides summing to seven. It also introduces dice puzzles created by physically altering dice, such as cutting a die into nine bars and arranging them in interesting ways (vertical bars in the middle layer, horizontal on outside) to create puzzles. Furthermore, it mentions assembling 3x3x3 cubes from components like V-Triominos or Soma cubes, with dice points drawn on them to add complexity. The text touches on Rubik's dice as a related complex puzzle involving rearranging tiles with points to achieve a uniform color.\n\nThe core idea revolves around the combinatorial and spatial complexity of dice configurations and physical puzzle constructions derived from them, highlighting both mathematical permutations and physical manipulation. The mention of using triominos or Soma cubes decorated with dice points implies a layered combinatorial and spatial reasoning challenge, linking discrete mathematics, geometry, and puzzle design.\n\nImplicit assumptions include understanding die symmetries and face numbering conventions, the combinatorial count of distinct dice, and the spatial implications of cutting and reconstructing dice into smaller components forming a larger cube.

Many of these changes to city names were done to make those names reflect the linguistic systems in the various areas. [PAR] The following is a brief history of some of India's most famous name changes: [PAR] Mumbai vs. Bombay [PAR] Mumbai is one of the world's ten largest cities today and is located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. This world-class city wasn't always known by this name however. Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay, which has its origins in the 1600s with the Portuguese. During their colonization of the area, they began calling it Bombaim - Portuguese for \"Good Bay.\" In 1661 though, this Portuguese colony was given to King Charles II of England after he married the Portuguese princess Catherine de Braganza. When the British then took control of the colony, its name became Bombay- an anglicized version of Bombaim. [PAR] The name Bombay then stuck until 1996 when the Indian government changed it to Mumbai. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] It is believed that this was the name of a Kolis settlement in the same area because many Kolis communities were named after their Hindu deities. By the early 20th Century, one of these settlements was named Mumbadevi for a goddess of the same name. [PAR] Therefore the change to the name of Mumbai in 1996 was an attempt to use the previous Hindi names for a city that was once controlled by the British. The use of the name Mumbai reached a global scale in 2006 when the Associated Press announced it would refer to what was once Bombay as Mumbai. [PAR] Chennai vs. Madras [PAR] However, Mumbai was not the only newly named Indian city in 1996. In August of that same year, the former city of Madras, located in the state of Tamil Nadu, had its name changed to Chennai. [PAR] Both the names Chennai and Madras date back to 1639. In that year, the Raja of Chandragiri, (a suburb in South India), allowed the British East India Company to build a fort near the town of Madraspattinam. At the same time, the local people built another town close to the site of the fort. This town was named Chennappatnam, after the father of one of the early rulers. Later, both the fort and the town grew together but the British shortened their colony's name to Madras while the Indians changed theirs to Chennai. [PAR] The name Madras (shortened from Madraspattinam) also has links to the Portuguese who were present in the area as early as the 1500s. Their exact impact on the naming of the area is unclear however and many rumors exist as to how the name really originated. Many historians believe that it may have come from the Madeiros family who lived there in the 1500s. [PAR] No matter where it originated though, Madras is a much older name than Chennai. Despite that fact, the city was still renamed Chennai because it is in the language of the area\u2019s original inhabitants and Madras was seen as being a Portuguese name and/or was associated with the former British colony. [PAR] Kolkata vs. Calcutta [PAR] More recently, in January 2001, one of the world's 25 largest cities, Calcutta, became Kolkata. At the same time the city\u2019s name changed, its state changed from West Bengal to Bangla as well. Like Madras, the origin of the name Kolkata is disputed.

ISBN 0-7613-1367-2. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.  [PAR] Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;   the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.  Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster \u2013 with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.  [PAR] Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa. Most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).   This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.  [PAR] Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name. [PAR] According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85\u2013165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \"Africa\" expanded with their knowledge. [PAR] Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \"Africa\": [PAR] * The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.

This rash of gang violence reached its bloody climax in a garage on the city\u2019s North Side on February 14, 1929, when seven men associated with the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, one of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, were shot to death by several men dressed as policemen. The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time. No one was ever brought to trial for the murders. [PAR] The Downfall of Public Enemy No. 1 [PAR] Though the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre marked the end of any significant gang opposition to Capone\u2019s rule in Chicago, it can also be said to have marked the beginning of his downfall. With his highly effective organization, his impressive income and his willingness to ruthlessly eliminate his rivals, Capone had become the country\u2019s most notorious gangster, and the newspapers dubbed him \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1.\u201d Federal authorities began investigating Capone after",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  [PAR] In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. [PAR] Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

Prof. James Kaler, using the figure of 2,600 light years as the distance, estimated a diameter 200 times greater than our sun, and about a quarter of a million times brighter in visible light. Considering its spectral classification (A2), Deneb must have a surface temperature between about 8500 to 9000 kelvins (roughly 14,800 to 15,700 degrees F). [PAR] This is the famous Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, which shows the luminosities of stars.  See Deneb at the top of the diagram?  It is one of the most luminous stars known. [PAR] Deneb is not the biggest star in the Milky Way. Betelgeuse and Antares , among others, are larger. But Deneb may well be the most energetic (based on the amount of electromagnetic radiation it produces) of the A-type stars. The famed North American nebula, a large cloud of glowing gas in the shape of the continent, likely is glowing in a process similar to fluorescence, energized by the radiation of Deneb.

You can gaze at this faraway star starting in late spring, when Deneb rises over the northeastern horizon by mid-evening. A month later, Deneb is already in the sky by the time it gets dark. In standard time, the midnight culmination date is about August 1. Using Daylight Time, the midnight culmination is about August 15. The word \u2018culmination\u2019 indicates the star\u2019s highest point in the sky. [PAR] Deneb is part of several famous star patterns, which overlap each other. It\u2019s the brightest of the stars composing the constellation Cygnus the Swan, where it marks the Swan\u2019s Tail. When you hear \u2018deneb\u2019 in a star name, it always means \u2018tail.\u2019 Simultaneously, Deneb marks the head of an asterism (a readily recognizable grouping of stars that is not an official constellation), known as the Northern Cross. Plus it is one of the three stars known as the Summer Triangle . The other two stars are Vega and Altair . Deneb is the northernmost and dimmest of the three Triangle stars, but its association with the other bright stars makes it easy to identify. [PAR] Deneb is circumpolar as seen from locations of",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context offers a detailed discussion on the challenges and methods involved in determining the distance to the star Deneb, emphasizing the uncertainty and variability in distance estimates. It highlights that Deneb\u2019s exact distance is unclear, with estimates ranging widely from roughly 1,425 to 7,000 light-years. The text identifies the Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission as the best source for distance estimates, noting the initial Hipparcos data suggested 3,230 light-years, whereas refined data yielded just over 1,400 light-years. This discrepancy underscores the difficulty in precisely measuring distances to very luminous and distant stars.\n\nThe context also mentions that Deneb\u2019s extreme luminosity and physical characteristics (A2Ia spectral classification, surface temperature, size) make it visible despite its great distance, and its brightness is tied to its intrinsic properties and distance. This implies that any error in distance estimation critically impacts derived physical properties such as size and luminosity.\n\nThe nuanced theme revolves around how parallax measurements from space missions (Hipparcos) can produce varying results depending on data refinement and analysis techniques, and how this uncertainty affects astrophysical interpretations.\n\nThe passage is rich in detail about the methods (astrometry, parallax), the nature of the data (initial vs. refined), and the astrophysical implications of distance uncertainty. It also implicitly addresses the limits of observational technology and data processing in stellar astronomy.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 \u2013 The question should challenge experts to synthesize knowledge about astrometric methods, data refinement, and the impact of distance uncertainty on astrophysical conclusions.\n\nThe question should encourage reflection on why distance measurement to Deneb is so problematic, how Hipparcos data contributes to resolving this, and the broader implications for stellar astronomy.

Harry was delighted and couldn't thank Hagrid enough, while Hedwig had already fallen asleep after leaving the shop. [2] This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the Dursleys did not celebrate his brithday. He became quickly attached to her. [PAR] Harry Potter's pet [PAR] Harry decided on her name after finding it in A History of Magic . Before attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Harry routinely stayed in his bedroom with Hedwig, away from the Dursleys , since she was his only friend at 4 Privet Drive . [4] Throughout her life, Hedwig provided Harry with mail service, as well as loyal companionship. Hedwig often showed Harry her affection by gently nibbling his ears and fingers, and seemed fully capable of understanding his wishes (as she faithfully followed Harry's orders to peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger until they responded to him). [PAR] Hedwig with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley [PAR] Hedwig was also highly intelligent, as she flew to France completely of her own accord while Hermione was on holiday there with her parents, just to ensure that Harry received a gift from her for his thirteenth birthday, later arriving at the Leaky Cauldron shortly after Harry stormed out of Privet Drive after a particularly bad argument despite the fact that she had been away and allegedly staying with the Weasleys when Harry left the Dursleys. According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions. She also seemed fairly disdainful of the hyperactive behaviour of Ron Weasley 's pet owl Pigwidgion (Pig, as Ron called him) [PAR] Harry having Hedwig deliver a message to Sirius Black [PAR] While living with the Dursleys , Hedwig was locked in her cage for months at a time to prevent Harry from sending messages to his \"freaky little friends.\" As a result, the first holidays after Hogwarts were a frustrating and boring time for her, as much as for Harry. When Harry was rescued by the Weasley brothers in 1992 , Hedwig was freed from her cage and flew along following behind the flying Ford Anglia all the way to The Burrow . In 1992 when Harry thought his friends had forgotten him, he mused that Hedwig was the only reason he knew that discovering the wizarding world had not just been a dream. Fortunately, her frustrated hooting during her first year with them convinced the Dursleys to subsequently let Harry let Hedwig out for flights so long as he didn't use her to send messages, though Harry sometimes ignored this rule and possibly began ignoring it entirely after meeting Sirius Black and gaining leverage with the Dursleys.

It is not Shakespeare\u2019s only play that features a move from the court to the woods \u2013 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream and Timon of Athens do the same \u2013 but in As You Like It the forest takes on a special role as a place of inversion, cross-dressing and unsettled gender roles. The escape from the court changes the characters and creates a space of sexual freedom and chaos, where women take control and men learn lessons in romance. In the comedies, the forest becomes a distorted version of the court where social rules are broken, creating a sense of jovial confusion before a return to civilisation in the final act. [PAR] \u2018Gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time [PAR] carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\u2019 Act 1.1 [PAR] The forest can be defined as a 'pastoral space\u2019 that represents the opposite of urban life in the play, representing the division between the city and the country that was beginning to emerge in Shakespeare\u2019s time. The country was often seen as a place of nostalgia for a simpler time, as shown in Duke Senior\u2019s forest court that echoes tales of Robin Hood. The merry court of the forest is an inversion of the court at the beginning of the play, far from the threats of violence and cruel treatment of Duke Frederick. Danger in the forest of As You Like It is never truly life-threatening but, when considering the role of the forest in other plays such as Titus Andronicus, the possibility of violence draws a long shadow over the plot. [PAR] 'Alas, what danger will it be to us, [PAR] Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\u2019 Act 1.3 [PAR] When Rosalind and Celia decide to enter the forest, they must put on disguises as 'beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\u2019 (1.3) The threat of displaying beauty is underscored by the reputation forests had during Shakespeare\u2019s time as spaces where vagrants lived outside society, presenting a danger of sexual violence for women who wandered there alone. For wealthy women, such as Rosalind and Celia, the threat would be even more pronounced as they would be visibly affluent in a place of extreme poverty, fuelling Celia\u2019s decision to dress in 'poor and mean attire\u2019. (1.3) The forest of Arden is a place of comedy but underlying the play is a sense of unspoken danger, drawing on the role of the forest as a place of tragedy and violence that it assumes in Shakespeare\u2019s other plays.

By leaving the court she leaves behind the pressures of being a noblewoman and is able to express her desire for Orlando, albeit while dressed as a man. That Rosalind must cross-dress in order to express her desires is evidence that the forest can only allow so much freedom: the woman may take control, but only while others believe she is male. Rosalind engages with Orlando in a way that can be seen as homoerotic, creating both the sexual and gender confusion that permeates the forest. Her disguise frees her from womanhood but entraps her in masculinity, meaning she cannot marry Orlando unless she returns to presenting as female. Gender never truly breaks down in the forest, showing how the pastoral space is still linked to societal values that render women subordinate, values that Rosalind plays into when declaring women 'apish, shallow, inconstant.\u2019 (3.2) [PAR] 'The duke hath put on a religious life",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the role of the Forest of Arden in Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" as a pastoral space that offers a temporary inversion of social norms, especially concerning gender and class. The forest is depicted as a place where the rigid structures of the court are loosened, allowing for cross-dressing, gender role confusion, and a degree of sexual freedom. However, this freedom is limited and conditional. For example, Rosalind must disguise herself as a man to exercise agency over her romantic life, indicating that true freedom for women is constrained by prevailing gender norms. The forest, while a comedic and nostalgic setting, still carries an undercurrent of danger and reflects societal values that maintain women's subordination and class distinctions, despite the apparent chaos and inversion. The forest is not a space of absolute liberation but rather a controlled environment where societal hierarchies and gender roles are negotiated but not dismantled. This nuanced understanding invites reflection on the tension between freedom and constraint within pastoral spaces and the persistence of societal values even in settings designed to challenge them.\n\nThe question difficulty should be rated as 9 because it requires deep knowledge of Shakespearean pastoral conventions, gender theory, and social hierarchies, as well as the ability to critically analyze how the text reflects and limits freedom in a seemingly liberating space. The question should challenge experts to reconcile the apparent freedom with the underlying restrictions, encouraging critical engagement with themes of gender performativity, social class, and the symbolic function of the pastoral.\n\nThe question will prompt reflection on how the pastoral setting both enables and restricts freedom, focusing on the paradox of Rosalind's cross-dressing and the forest's role in preserving societal values despite its inversion of norms.\n\nThis ensures a highly challenging, insightful question that probes expert understanding beyond surface interpretations.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In what way does Rosalind\u2019s cross-dressing in the Forest of Arden illustrate the paradoxical limitations of freedom within Shakespeare\u2019s pastoral space, particularly regarding gender and societal values?\n\nA: It shows that true freedom for women is only achievable by adopting male identity, underscoring that gender norms remain intact even in the pastoral setting.\n\nB: It indicates that the forest completely dissolves gender distinctions, allowing women to express themselves without restriction.\n\nC: It suggests that cross-dressing is a mere comedic device with no deeper implication on gender or societal freedom.\n\nD: It reveals that the pastoral space enforces harsher gender roles than the court, restricting freedom more severely.\n\nExplanation: Rosalind\u2019s need to disguise herself as a man to control her romantic agency demonstrates that the pastoral forest allows only conditional freedom\u2014women can act with autonomy only when perceived as male\u2014highlighting that gender norms and societal subordination persist even in this seemingly liberating space.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used to refer to actions of the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\".  [PAR] The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban  and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico  in 1829. [PAR] Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt. [PAR] The modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice President\u2014and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of \"America's Favorite Architecture\". [PAR] Early history [PAR] 1789\u20131800 [PAR] Following his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two executive mansions in New York City: the Samuel Osgood House at 3 Cherry Street (April 1789\u00a0\u2013 February 1790), and the Alexander Macomb House at 39\u201341 Broadway (February\u2013August 1790). In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. [PAR] The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it. [PAR] President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On November 1, in 1800,  he became the first president to occupy the White House. The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Last of the Summer WineLast of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke that was originally broadcast on the BBC. Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series. Last of the Summer Wine inspired other adaptations, including a television prequel,  several novelisations,  and stage adaptations.  [PAR] Production [PAR] History and development [PAR]",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a comprehensive overview of the British sitcom \"Last of the Summer Wine,\" focusing on its extensive run over 31 series and multiple decades. Central ideas include the evolving composition of the main trio of characters, the shift from a trio-centric narrative to an ensemble cast, and the show's consistent thematic focus on the antics and perspectives of elderly characters. There is an emphasis on how character changes, including replacements due to actor deaths or aging, were managed to maintain continuity and audience interest. The text also touches on narrative strategies such as the introduction of supporting characters with their own running jokes and subplots, as well as the transition to a younger trio later in the series. Additionally, the show\u2019s positive portrayal of older people and family-friendly humor contributed to its longevity and popularity despite some perceived decline in quality. The detailed character development and adaptation to cast changes are nuanced themes, reflecting sophisticated narrative and production strategies to sustain audience engagement over decades. \n\nImplicit assumptions include the necessity of character continuity and evolution in long-running series, the importance of ensemble dynamics, and balancing familiar elements with fresh storylines. The underlying theory relates to narrative longevity in serial television, especially in sitcoms dealing with aging protagonists, requiring strategic character and plot development to maintain relevance and viewer interest. Potential applications include understanding how long-running shows can adapt to changes in cast and audience demographics while preserving core thematic elements.\n\nThe difficulty rating is 9/10, as the question must probe understanding of complex narrative and character development strategies sustaining a multi-decade series, requiring synthesis beyond surface-level facts.

[PAR] International adoption [PAR] After the phonetic alphabet was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  (see history below) it was adopted by many other international and national organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). [PAR] It is a subset of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which originally included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound signals by whistle, siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases.  The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...).  In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages. [PAR] NATO [PAR] A common name for this spelling alphabet, \"NATO phonetic alphabet,\" exists because it appears in Allied Tactical Publication ATP-1, Volume II: Allied Maritime Signal and Maneuvering Book used by all allied navies of NATO, which adopted a modified form of the International Code of Signals. Because the latter allows messages to be spelled via flags or Morse code, it naturally named the code words used to spell out messages by voice its \"phonetic alphabet\". The name NATO phonetic alphabet became widespread because the signals used to facilitate the naval communications and tactics of NATO have become global.  [PAR] However, ATP-1 is marked NATO Confidential (or the lower NATO Restricted) so it is not available publicly. Nevertheless, a NATO unclassified version of the document is provided to foreign, even hostile, militaries, even though they are not allowed to make it available publicly. The spelling alphabet is now also defined in other unclassified international military documents.  [PAR] The NATO alphabet appeared in some United States Air Force Europe publications during the Cold War. A particular example was the Ramstein Air Base, Telephone Directory published between 1969 and 1973 (currently out of print). The American and NATO versions had differences and the translation was provided as a convenience. Differences included Alfa, Bravo and Able, Baker for the first two letters. [PAR] History [PAR] The ICAO developed this system in the 1950s in order to account for discrepancies that might arise in communications as a result of multiple alphabet naming systems coexisting in different places and organizations.  [PAR] In the official   version of the alphabet, the non-English spellings Alfa and Juliett are used. Alfa is spelled with an f as it is in most European languages because the English and French spelling alpha would not be pronounced properly by native speakers of some other languages \u2013 who may not know that ph should be pronounced as f.\u00a0 Juliett is spelled with a tt",

Its 39 half-hour episodes were originally screened on ITV in the United Kingdom and in syndication in Canada and the United States. The scriptwriters included the Andersons, Alan Fennell, and Dennis Spooner. Barry Gray composed the music, and Derek Meddings served as special effects director. [PAR] Stingray was the first Supermarionation production in which the marionette characters had interchangeable heads featuring a variety of expressions. It was also the first British television series to be filmed entirely in colour over its production run. [PAR] Plot [PAR] Stingray, a highly sophisticated combat submarine built for speed and manoeuvrability, is the flag vessel of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a security organisation based at Marineville in the year 2065.  It is capable of speeds of up to 600 kn, while advanced pressure compensators allow it to submerge to depths of over 36000 ft, enabling cruising to the bottom of any part of any of the Earth's oceans. Marineville is located somewhere in California, on the West Coast of the United States. In the case of it being under attack, battle stations is sounded and all the buildings and vehicles are sent down on hydraulic jacks into the safety of underground bunkers, protected by enormous steel and concrete shutters whilst missiles are deployed from underground silos and fighter jets are launched. The base lies 10 mi inland, and Stingray is launched from \"Pen 3\" through a tunnel leading to the Pacific Ocean. The alerts \"action stations\", \"launch stations\", and \"battle stations\" are sounded by a rapid drum-beat (composed and recorded by series composer Barry Gray) that is played over Marineville's public address system. Commands given by radio are acknowledged with the acronym: P.W.O.R. which stands for, \"Proceeding With Orders Received\". [PAR] The pilot of Stingray is the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest (whose Supermarionation puppet was modelled on actor James Garner). He is paired with Dixie navigator Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed \"Phones\" for his role as Stingray's hydrophone operator. (Phones' real name, George Sheridan, is referred to in the series' publicity material but is not mentioned on-screen.) Troy and Phones board Stingray by sitting on twin injector seats in Marineville's stand-by lounge, which are sent down rapidly into the vessel through injector tubes and clamped down into place. They answer to the crusty \"hoverchair\"-bound Commander Samuel Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, is enamoured of Troy. The reason for Shore's disability is revealed in the episode \"The Ghost of the Sea\": as a security agent for a deep-sea mining platform, he was injured when a hostile submersible attacked the facility and damaged his patrol craft. He managed to ram the enemy in return, and then escape to the surface, but in so doing lost the use of his legs. Sub-Lieutenant John Horatio Fisher also regularly takes shifts in the Marineville control room. [PAR] During the course of the series, Stingray encounters a number of undersea races, both friendly and hostile. The Aquaphibians, an aquatic warrior race, appear regularly\u2014usually under the command of King Titan (modelled on Laurence Olivier), who is the tyrannical ruler of the underwater city of Titanica. In the pilot episode, Stingray is attacked by Titan's forces and Troy and Phones are captured. They are rescued by Titan's slave girl, Marina (modelled on Brigitte Bardot),  a mute young woman who can breathe underwater. Troy immediately becomes infatuated with Marina, causing Atlanta to become jealous. Titan, meanwhile, swears revenge for Marina's betrayal. Marina becomes a regular member of Stingray's crew, and later acquires a pet seal pup named Oink, who appears in a number of episodes. [PAR] Many later episodes revolve around Titan's schemes to destroy Stingray and Marineville.

[PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was a dominant and controversial figure in Victorian England and the leading British statesman of the 19th century. He served in the British government from the 1830s to the 1890s, and as Prime Minister of Britain on four occasions he reformed both British government and society. [PAR] Gladstone is often viewed as the moral and political voice of the Victorian era, yet he was famously disliked by Queen Victoria . [PAR] One of Gladstone's lifelong obsessions was the \"rescuing\" of English prostitutes, and his activities in that regard made some question his motivations and even his sanity. [PAR] Early Life of Gladstone [PAR] William Ewart Gladstone was born on December 29, 1809 in Liverpool. His family was of Scottish descent, and his father, Sir John Gladstone, became a wealthy merchant in the port city of Liverpool and had investments in slave plantations in the West Indies. [PAR] After being educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, Gladstone took a trip to Italy and then returned to Britain and was elected to Parliament. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Though he would become the leader of the Liberal Party, he was first elected as a Tory. His first address in Parliament was a defense of slave owners in the West Indies, in which he used his father as an example. [PAR] Gladstone's Politics Shifted from Conservative to Liberal [PAR] In the British government Gladstone was at first aligned with Sir Robert Peel, but throughout the 1840s Gladstone\u2019s politics evolved until he began taking positions more in line with the Liberal party. A trip to Naples in the early 1850s, where he witnessed extreme poverty, may have helped drive him away from Tory orthodoxy. [PAR] In the 1850s Gladstone served as chancellor of the exchequer, the chief financial officer of the British government, and was influential in passing financial reforms, including the abolition of many taxes and tariffs. [PAR] Leader of\u00a0the Liberal Party [PAR] In the late 1850s Gladstone gravitated toward a newly formulated Liberal party and became its leader. [PAR] Gladstone's party won an overwhelming majority in the elections of 1868, and he became prime minister. He focused on reforms, which were often targeted at reducing the influence of privilege and making British institutions, such as civil service and the military, open to those beyond the privileged classes. [PAR] Gladstone and the Issue of Irish Home Rule: [PAR] Gladstone served four terms as prime minister: [PAR] 1868-1874 [PAR] 1886 [PAR] 1892-94 [PAR] During his first term as prime minister Gladstone pushed reforms intended to improve the lot of the Irish peasantry. In fact, Gladstone became intensely interested in the \"Irish question,\" and many of his ideas for reform were focused on Britain's administration of Ireland . [PAR] Gladstone, throughout the late 1800s, often advocated \"home rule\" for Ireland. While it wasn't a call for outright Irish independence, it was considered by many a radical position. [PAR] Bitter Rivalry With Benjamin Disraeli [PAR] The other leading political player in Victorian Britain was Benjamin Disraeli, who, like Gladstone, held a variety of government posts and served as Prime Minister. For decades Gladstone and Disraeli were rivals, and it is known that they detested each other. [PAR] The two men came from very opposite backgrounds, and while they were both highly intelligent, they often battled on opposite sides of an issue. And they also had different relationships with Queen Victoria, who liked Disraeli and complained bitterly of Gladstone's attitude toward her. [PAR] Gladstone's Attacks on Disraeli Were Effective [PAR] Gladstone was opposed to Britain's imperial foreign policy. And in the late 1870s, while out of power, he published a controversial pamphlet attacking the foreign policy of Benjamin Disraeli , who was the current prime minister.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak. As Tex, his horse, and dog are very thirsty, Kalamakooya",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides detailed information about the production and technical aspects of the 1960 puppet TV show \"Four Feather Falls,\" created by Gerry Anderson. It highlights the innovations in puppetry, including the use of Supermarionation techniques such as fiberglass heads with movable eyes and sound-activated lip movement. Specifically relevant to the question topic, it mentions how animal puppets like Tex's horse Rocky and dog Dusty were operated: their movement was achieved by pulling them on trolleys, which meant their feet were never shown while moving. This production choice was influenced by budget constraints and technical limitations.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] James BondThe James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. [PAR] The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of , there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.  There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). [PAR] The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\" [PAR] Fleming also endowed",

[PAR] On his first day at school Bernard crossed swords with caretaker Norman Potter (Deryck Guyler), a former Desert Rat with delusions of grandeur, although with some credibility as he was the right hand man of incompetent headmaster, Maurice Cromwell (Noel Howlett), who in turn was the subject of infatuation by formidable deputy head Doris Ewell (Joan Sanderson). This trio virtually ran the school much to the resignation of the rest of the disillusioned staff and the last thing they wanted to disturb the balance was a young schoolmaster fresh out of teachers training college and full of bright ideals about modern teaching. [PAR] In order to curb Bernard's na\u00efve enthusiasm it was conspired between the trio to give him a class of 'no-hopers', namely 5C. In their last year at school the pupils of this class were an uneducable bunch of delinquents who were simply biding their time until the final bell sounded on the last day of term. This of course did not involve participating in any school activities such as lessons. However, through a series of (comical) events Bernard managed to win over not only the staff but also the class of pupils (who nicknamed him 'Privet' Hedges) that contained 'hard case' Patrick Duffy (Peter Cleall), the tough talking but wimpish Frankie (Hank) Abbott (David Barry), slow witted Dennis Dunstable (Peter Denyer), flirtatious Sharon (Penny Spencer in the first two season's, Carol Hawkins thereafter), and Maureen (Liz Gebhart), who had a crush on her teacher. Support on the teacher front came from Richard Davies who gave a first class performance as the down to earth no-nonsense Welsh science teacher, Mr Price, and the aging Eric Chitty as Mr Smith, a teacher that was clearly beyond retirement age at the series outset. In fact most of the actors who played the students were already in their twenties when Please Sir! began in 1968 and two years later (at the end of the longest last year in school history) the pupils were clearly showing their age. [PAR] The series made stars of several actors although oddly none of the students found lasting television fame. LWT Head of Light Entertainment, Frank Muir, cast Alderton as Bernard Hedges after he had spotted him as a teacher in the opening episode of Never A Cross Word. After leaving Fenn Street School the actor went on to several successful series such as Upstairs, Downstairs, it's spin-off series Thomas and Sarah, the LWT sitcom No-Honestly and a series of Wodehouse plays (Wodehouse Playhouse) for BBC (all of which Alderton co-starred alongside his wife, Pauline Collins), and the BBC sitcom My Wife Next Door with Hannah Gordon. Joan Sanderson won television immortality as Mrs Richards, the hotel guest with hearing problems in Fawlty Towers and after Please Sir! had finished she teamed up again with Deryck Guyler (who was originally cast as Fenn Street's headmaster) on a BBC radio show (also penned by the same writers), You're Only Young Once. [PAR] A 1971 feature movie was released in which Bernard meets and begins to date Penny Wheeler (Jill Kerman), and this was carried on in subsequent TV series of Please Sir! and its predecessor, The Fenn Street Gang (which in turn spawned Bowler), which briefly followed the fortunes of the pupils after they left school. [PAR] The series was the creation of former school chums and a new-to-television comedy writing team of John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, who went on to write Get Some In!; Ever Decreasing Circles; As Time Goes By and the enormously successful The Good Life.

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry. With no reserves, Tallard's line broke and his troops began fleeing towards H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. They were joined in their flight by the Bavarians from Lutzingen. [PAR] Trapped in Blenheim, Cl\u00e9rambault's men continued the fight until 9:00 PM when over 10,000 of them surrendered. As the French fled southwest, a group of Hessian troops managed to capture Marshall Tallard, who was to spend the next seven years in captivity in England. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Aftermath & Impact: [PAR] In the fighting at Blenheim, the Allies lost 4,542 killed and 7,942 wounded, while the French and Bavarians suffered approximately 20,000 killed and wounded as well as 14,190 captured. The Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim ended the French threat to Vienna and removed the aura of invincibility that surrounded the armies of Louis XIV. The battle was a turning point in the War of Spanish Succession, ultimately leading to the Grand Alliance's victory and an end of French hegemony over Europe.",

Much of the planning for the revolution took place outside the country, in places like Angola, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique. The Carnation Revolution led to tensions in Portuguese-U.S. relations as the American government believed a Communist victory was imminent. The revolution ended in the peaceful overthrow of Caetano and the Estado Novo or the Second Republic, which had been the installed in 1933 and was the longest surviving regime in Western Europe.

A key nuanced theme is the international dimension, particularly the tension this revolution introduced into Portugal's relations with the United States. The U.S. government was concerned about a potential Communist victory, reflecting Cold War ideological anxieties.

It has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800.  The term White House is often used to refer to actions of the president and his advisers, as in \"The White House announced that...\".  [PAR] The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban  and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted Aquia Creek sandstone in the Neoclassical style. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage.  In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by the British Army in the Burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the semi-circular South portico in 1824 and the North portico  in 1829. [PAR] Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. In the main mansion, the third-floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt. [PAR] The modern-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u2014the former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice President\u2014and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories\u2014the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of \"America's Favorite Architecture\". [PAR] Early history [PAR] 1789\u20131800 [PAR] Following his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two executive mansions in New York City: the Samuel Osgood House at 3 Cherry Street (April 1789\u00a0\u2013 February 1790), and the Alexander Macomb House at 39\u201341 Broadway (February\u2013August 1790). In May 1790, New York began construction of Government House for his official residence, but he never occupied it. The national capital moved to Philadelphia in December 1790. [PAR] The July 1790 Residence Act named Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the Federal City was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented Robert Morris's city house at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away, but Washington declined to occupy it. [PAR] President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. On November 1, in 1800,  he became the first president to occupy the White House. The President's House in Philadelphia became a hotel and was demolished in 1832, while the unused presidential mansion became home to the University of Pennsylvania.

The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931\u00a0BC, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. [PAR] According to the Talmud, Solomon is one of the 48 prophets.  In the Qur'an, he is considered a major prophet, and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman, son of David.  Solomon (Arabic \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 Sulaym\u0101n) was, according to the Qur'an, a king of ancient Israel as well as the son of David. The Qur'an recognizes Solomon as a prophet and a divinely-appointed monarch. Islamic tradition generally holds that Solomon was the third king of Israel and was a just and wise ruler for the nation.  [PAR] The Hebrew Bible credits him as the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem. It portrays him as great in wisdom, wealth, and power beyond any of the previous kings of the country, but ultimately as a human king who sinned. His sins included idolatry and turning away from Yahweh, and led to the kingdom's being torn in two during the reign of his son Rehoboam.  Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends, most notably in the 1st-century apocryphal work known as the Testament of Solomon. In later years, in mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.  [PAR] Biblical account [PAR] Childhood [PAR] Solomon was born in Jerusalem,  the second born child to David and his wife Bathsheba, widow of Uriah the Hittite. The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died before Solomon was conceived as a punishment by Yahweh on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers through Bathsheba, Nathan, Shammua, and Shobab,  besides six known older half-brothers through as many mothers.  [PAR] Succession and administration [PAR] According to the First Book of Kings, when David was old, \"he could not get warm.\"  \"So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.\" [PAR] While David was in this state, court factions were maneuvering for power. David's heir apparent, Adonijah, acted to have himself declared king, but was outmaneuvered by Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan, who convinced David to proclaim Solomon king according to his earlier promise, despite Solomon being younger than his brothers. [PAR] Solomon, as instructed by David, began his reign with an extensive purge, including his father's chief general, Joab, among others, and further consolidated his position by appointing friends throughout the administration, including in religious positions as well as in civic and military posts. [PAR] Solomon greatly expanded his military strength, especially the cavalry and chariot arms. He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts. [PAR] Trade relationships were a focus of his administration. In particular he continued his father's very profitable relationship with the Phoenician king Hiram of Tyre (see 'wealth' below); they sent out joint expeditions to the lands of Tarshish and Ophir to engage in the trade of luxury products, importing gold",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context offers a multifaceted portrayal of Solomon, focusing on his depiction in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. Central ideas include Solomon's identity as a wealthy and wise king, his lineage as the son of David, and his reign as the third monarch of the United Monarchy of Israel. The text highlights key contrasts: in the Hebrew Bible, Solomon is a human king who, despite his wisdom and power, commits sins such as idolatry leading to the kingdom's division; in Islamic tradition, Solomon (Sulayman) is both a prophet and a divinely-appointed monarch, emphasizing his just and wise rule without highlighting sin. The Talmud recognizes him as one of 48 prophets, bridging Jewish prophetic tradition with Christian and Islamic views. The text also notes Solomon\u2019s administrative and military expansions, and his role in trade, underscoring his political and economic significance beyond religious characterizations.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the distinct theological frameworks that influence Solomon\u2019s portrayal: Jewish and Christian scriptures focus on human fallibility and moral consequence, while Islamic tradition emphasizes prophetic legitimacy and divine appointment. The subtle differences in how Solomon\u2019s wisdom and authority are framed reflect broader doctrinal perspectives on kingship, prophecy, and divine favor. Additionally, the text touches on the later legendary and mystical aspects of Solomon, such as his association with magic and exorcism, which are non-canonical but culturally significant.\n\nThe difficulty level of a question probing these nuances should be high (8-9), targeting a domain expert\u2019s ability to synthesize theological, historical, and literary perspectives across traditions.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context primarily centers on the composition and characteristics of European armies during the early 18th century, specifically referencing the Battle of Blenheim in 1704. It details the makeup of British and French forces, their troop types, and the evolving military practices of the period. A key point relevant to the question topic is the mention of irregular light troops within the Austrian Empire\u2014namely Hussars from Hungary, and Bosniak and Pandour troops from the Balkans. The text notes that these irregular light troops were used for scouting duties and that by the 18th century, the use of such irregulars and light infantry had proliferated across European armies, with hussar regiments becoming a standard component.\n\nThe passage highlights the contrast between regular infantry and cavalry formations (e.g., line infantry with muskets and bayonets, dragoons transitioning to cavalry roles) and the more flexible, irregular light troops used for reconnaissance and presumably other irregular warfare roles. It implies a tactical evolution in European armies incorporating light, fast, irregular units alongside traditional line troops.\n\nHowever, the context does not deeply elaborate on the specific tactical roles, command structures, or strategic significance of these irregular troops beyond their use in scouting and their spread across Europe. It also references the diversity of these troops' origins, showing a multinational aspect within the Austrian forces.\n\nThe question should therefore probe the nuanced military and strategic implications of employing such irregular troops\u2014how they complemented regular forces, the reasons for their proliferation, and their significance in the broader evolution of European military doctrine. This requires integrating knowledge of early 18th-century military organization, the challenges of reconnaissance and skirmishing before modern communications, and the operational advantages irregular light troops provided.\n\nDifficulty is rated at 9 because the question demands understanding beyond the text itself, requiring synthesis of military history concepts and implications of integrating irregular troops into formal armies.\n\nThe question will encourage reflection on the strategic rationale and consequences of employing irregular light troops like Hussars, Bosniaks, and Pandours, inviting critical engagement with their role in transforming European military practices.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How did the incorporation of irregular light troops such as Hussars, Bosniaks, and Pandours into the Austrian and other European armies of the early 18th century fundamentally alter the operational capabilities and tactical doctrines of these forces compared to traditional line infantry and cavalry formations?\n\nA: They primarily served as heavy shock troops that replaced traditional cavalry charges in battle, shifting the focus from firepower to melee combat.\n\nB: Their role as fast-moving scouting and skirmishing units enhanced battlefield reconnaissance and flexibility, enabling armies to conduct more effective intelligence gathering and irregular warfare alongside conventional formations.\n\nC: They were used mainly as static defensive units guarding fortifications, which allowed regular troops to be concentrated exclusively for offensive operations.\n\nD: Their inclusion led to the abandonment of line infantry formations in favor of dispersed irregular units, fundamentally transforming European armies into guerrilla-style forces.\n\nExplanation: Irregular light troops such as Hussars, Bosniaks, and Pandours provided armies with enhanced mobility and reconnaissance capabilities, allowing for better intelligence and flexible skirmishing tactics that complemented traditional line infantry and cavalry.

If the skin of a typical 150-pound (68-kilogram) adult male were stretched out flat, it would cover about 2 square yards (1.7 square meters) and weigh about 9 pounds (4 kilograms). Our skin protects the network of muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and everything else inside our bodies. Our eyelids have the thinnest skin, the soles of our feet the thickest. [PAR] Hair is actually a modified type of skin. Hair grows everywhere on the human body except the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips. Hair grows more quickly in summer than winter, and more slowly at night than during the day. [PAR] Like hair, nails are a type of modified skin. Nails protect the sensitive tips of fingers and toes. Human nails aren't necessary for living, but they do provide support for the tips of the fingers and toes, protect them from injury, and aid in picking up small objects. Without them, we'd have a hard time scratching an itch or untying a knot. Nails can be an indicator of a person's general health, and illness often affects their growth. [PAR] continue [PAR] Skin Basics [PAR] Skin is essential in many ways. It forms a barrier that prevents harmful substances and microorganisms from entering the body. It protects body tissues against injury. It also controls the loss of life-sustaining fluids like blood and water, helps regulate body temperature through perspiration (sweating), and protects from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays. [PAR] Without the nerve cells in skin, people couldn't feel warmth, cold, or other sensations. For instance, goosebumps form when the erector pili muscles contract to make hairs on the skin stand up straight when someone is cold, excited,\u00a0or frightened \u2014 the blood vessels keep the body from losing heat by narrowing as much as possible and keeping the warm blood away from the skin's surface, offering insulation and protection. [PAR] Every square inch of skin contains thousands of cells and hundreds of sweat glands, oil glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels. Skin is made up of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous tissue. [PAR] The upper layer of our skin, the epidermis, is the tough, protective outer layer. It's about as thick as a sheet of paper over most parts of the body. The epidermis has four layers of cells that are constantly flaking off and being renewed. In these four layers are three special types of cells: [PAR] Melanocytes produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. All people have roughly the same number of melanocytes; the more melanin that is produced, the darker the skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the production of melanin, which is why people get suntanned or freckled. [PAR] Keratinocytes produce keratin, a type of protein that is a basic component of hair, skin, nails, and helps create an intact barrier. [PAR] Langerhans cells help protect the body against infection. [PAR] Because the cells in the epidermis are completely replaced about every 28 days, cuts and scrapes heal quickly. [PAR] Below the epidermis is the next layer of our skin, the dermis, which is made up of blood vessels, nerve endings, and connective tissue. The dermis nourishes the epidermis. Two types of fibers in the dermis \u2014 collagen and elastin \u2014 help the skin stretch when we bend and reposition itself when we straighten up. Collagen is strong and hard to stretch, and elastin, as its name suggests, is elastic. In older people, some of the elastin-containing fibers degenerate, which is one reason why the skin looks wrinkled. [PAR] The dermis also contains a person's sebaceous glands. These glands, which surround and empty into hair follicles and pores, produce the oil sebum that lubricates the skin and hair. Sebaceous glands are found mostly in the skin on the face, upper back, shoulders, and chest. [PAR] Most",

[PAR] Three of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead.

It contrasts this with higher latitudes beyond the Tropics, where the sun is never directly overhead and seasonal variation is more pronounced. The text also clarifies that the tropics experience nearly constant day length and sunlight angle year-round, explaining the lack of seasons, although altitude can cause temperature variation (example: Mauna Kea).

The narrator of the novel is Ishmael , a sailor on the Pequod who undertakes the journey out of his affection for the sea. [PAR] Moby Dick begins with Ishmael's arrival in New Bedford as he travels toward Nantucket. He rests at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, where he meets Queequeg , a harpooner from New Zealand who will also sail on the Pequod. Although Queequeg appears dangerous, he and Ishmael must share a bed together and the narrator quickly grows fond of the somewhat uncivilized harpooner. Queequeg is actually the son of a High Chief who left New Zealand because of his desire to learn among Christians. The next day, Ishmael attends a church service and listens to a sermon by Father Mapple , a renowned preacher who delivers a sermon considering Jonah and the whale that concludes that the tale is a lesson to preacher Truth in the face of Falsehood. [PAR] On a schooner to Nantucket, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a local bumpkin who mocks Queequeg. However, when this bumpkin is swept overboard, Queequeg saves him. In Nantucket, Queequeg and Ishmael choose between three ships for a year journey, and decide upon the Pequod. The Captain of the Pequod, Peleg , is now retired, and merely owns the boat with another Quaker, Bildad . Peleg tells them of the new captain, Ahab, and immediately describes him as a grand and ungodly man. Before leaving for their voyage, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a stranger named Elijah who predicts disaster on their journey. Before leaving on the Pequod, Elijah again predicts disaster. [PAR] Ishmael and Queequeg board the Pequod, where Captain Ahab is still unseen, secluded in his own cabin. Peleg and Bildad consult with Starbuck , the first mate. He is a Quaker and a Nantucket native who is quite practical. The second mate is Stubb , a Cape Cod native with a more jovial and carefree attitude. The third is Flask , a Martha's Vineyard native with a pugnacious attitude. Melville introduces the rest of the crew, including the Indian harpooner Tashtego , the African harpooner Daggoo . [PAR] Several days into the voyage, Ahab finally appears as a man seemingly made of bronze who stands on an ivory leg fashioned from whalebone. He eventually gets into a violent argument with Stubb when the second mate makes a joke at Ahab's expense, and kicks him. This leads Stubb to dream of kicking Ahab's ivory leg off, but Flask claims that the kick from Ahab is a sign of honor.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed summary of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick,\" focusing notably on Captain Ahab's character and his psychological complexity. Central themes include Ahab\u2019s relentless obsession with the white whale, Moby Dick, and his recognition of his own madness. The text highlights Ahab\u2019s symbolic perception of Moby Dick as a \"mask\" behind which some unknown truth lies, compelling him to strike through it despite the risk of self-destruction. The summary touches on the tension between Ahab and other characters, particularly Starbuck, who perceives Ahab\u2019s obsession as madness and fears the consequences. It also mentions Ahab\u2019s physical embodiment of his quest (the ivory leg) and his isolation, suggesting a profound internal struggle that affects the narrative trajectory. The psychological complexity of Ahab includes his self-awareness of madness, which is unusual for a tragic hero and adds layers to his characterization, influencing how the story unfolds and how other characters respond to him.\n\nImplicit in this analysis is an exploration of madness as both a personal and narrative force, the symbolic representation of the whale as an inscrutable enigma, and the consequences of obsession.

The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture. [PAR] The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series, with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005. [PAR] Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons. [PAR] Many tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.

[PAR] However both Astatine and Element No. 117 are too radioactive to be made in quantities that can be weighed. They are man made elements that have very short half lives;\u00a0 so decay into other elements before one has the chance to make any of their compounds. So in most laboratories Halogen chemistry is essentially about the study of Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine & Iodine. [PAR] The word Halogen was coined in 1842 by the Swedish Chemist Berzelius ( 1779 - 1848 ). It is a made up Swedish word which literally means \"Salt producer\" in Swedish.

An individual\u00a0 proton always has a charge of +1 and an individual electron always has a charge of -1. [PAR] We have 9 protons in an atom of fluorine each having a charge of +1, plus 9 electrons in that same atom orbiting the nucleus of that atom. [PAR] ( +1 X 9 ) + (-1 X 9 ) = 0.

However, due to their high reactivity, the halogens are never found in nature in native form. The family name means \"salt-forming,\" from the Greek for salt, \"hals\", and for generating \"genes\". The salinity of the oceans on Earth is due in large part to such halogen salts (halides) as sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium iodide (KI).

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed description of the halogens (Group 17 elements), emphasizing their shared characteristic of having seven electrons in their outermost electron shell. This valence electron configuration is central to their chemical behavior and reactivity. The text highlights that these seven valence electrons participate actively in chemical reactions, with the electron count in the outer shell potentially increasing to eight, which aligns with the octet rule driving chemical stability in atoms. The halogens\u2019 high reactivity is tied to their tendency to gain one electron to complete their valence shell, leading to the formation of halide ions and the creation of salts. The text also touches on the fact that these elements are never found in their elemental form naturally due to this high reactivity, and the name \"halogen\" literally means \"salt producer,\" underscoring the relationship between their valence electron configuration and compound formation. Additionally, the context references the physical states and colors of halogens, but the core chemical significance lies in the seven valence electrons.\n\nImplicit in the text is the fundamental chemical principle of valence electrons dictating reactivity and compound formation. The halogens\u2019 electron affinity and their drive to complete an octet govern their interactions with metals and other elements to form stable ionic or covalent bonds.

Although Lemuel Gulliver\u2019s vivid and detailed style of narration makes it clear that he is intelligent and well educated, his perceptions are na\u00efve and gullible. He has virtually no emotional life, or at least no awareness of it, and his comments are strictly factual. Indeed, sometimes his obsession with the facts of navigation, for example, becomes unbearable for us, as his fictional editor, Richard Sympson, makes clear when he explains having had to cut out nearly half of Gulliver\u2019s verbiage. Gulliver never thinks that the absurdities he encounters are funny and never makes the satiric connections between the lands he visits and his own home. Gulliver\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 makes the satire possible, as we pick up on things that Gulliver does not notice. [PAR] Read an in-depth analysis of Gulliver. [PAR] The emperor\u00a0-\u00a0 The ruler of Lilliput. Like all Lilliputians, the emperor is fewer than six inches tall. His power and majesty impress Gulliver deeply, but to us he appears both laughable and sinister. Because of his tiny size, his belief that he can control Gulliver seems silly, but his willingness to execute his subjects for minor reasons of politics or honor gives him a frightening aspect. He is proud of possessing the tallest trees and biggest palace in the kingdom, but he is also quite hospitable, spending a fortune on his captive\u2019s food. The emperor is both a satire of the autocratic ruler and a strangely serious portrait of political power. [PAR] The farmer\u00a0-\u00a0 Gulliver\u2019s first master in Brobdingnag. The farmer speaks to Gulliver, showing that he is willing to believe that the relatively tiny Gulliver may be as rational as he himself is, and treats him with gentleness. However, the farmer puts Gulliver on display around Brobdingnag, which clearly shows that he would rather profit from his discovery than converse with him as an equal. His exploitation of Gulliver as a laborer, which nearly starves Gulliver to death, seems less cruel than simpleminded. Generally, the farmer represents the average Brobdingnagian of no great gifts or intelligence, wielding an extraordinary power over Gulliver simply by virtue of his immense size. [PAR] Glumdalclitch\u00a0-\u00a0 The farmer\u2019s nine-year-old daughter, who is forty feet tall. Glumdalclitch becomes Gulliver\u2019s friend and nursemaid, hanging him to sleep safely in her closet at night and teaching him the Brobdingnagian language by day. She is skilled at sewing and makes Gulliver several sets of new clothes, taking delight in dressing him. When the queen discovers that no one at court is suited to care for Gulliver, she invites Glumdalclitch to live at court as his sole babysitter, a function she performs with great seriousness and attentiveness. To Glumdalclitch, Gulliver is basically a living doll, symbolizing the general status Gulliver has in Brobdingnag. [PAR] The queen\u00a0-\u00a0 The queen of Brobdingnag, who is so delighted by Gulliver\u2019s beauty and charms that she agrees to buy him from the farmer for 1,000 pieces of gold. Gulliver appreciates her kindness after the hardships he suffers at the farmer\u2019s and shows his usual fawning love for royalty by kissing the tip of her little finger when presented before her. She possesses, in Gulliver\u2019s words, \u201cinfinite\u201d wit and humor, though this description may entail a bit of Gulliver\u2019s characteristic flattery of superiors. The queen seems genuinely considerate, asking Gulliver whether he would consent to live at court instead of simply taking him in as a pet and inquiring into the reasons for his cold good-byes with the farmer. She is by no means a hero, but simply a pleasant, powerful person. [PAR] The king\u00a0-\u00a0 The king of Brobdingnag, who, in contrast to the emperor of Lilliput, seems to be a true intellectual, well versed in political science among other disciplines. While his wife has an intimate, friendly relationship with the diminutive visitor, the king\u2019s relation to Gulliver is limited to serious discussions about the history and institutions of Gulliver\u2019s native land.",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed characterization of the emperor of Lilliput, emphasizing a duality in his portrayal: he is simultaneously laughable due to his minute physical size and sinister because of his ruthless political behavior. The emperor's tiny stature makes his belief in controlling Gulliver appear absurd, which invites humor and satire. However, his readiness to execute subjects for trivial political reasons reveals a darker, more threatening aspect of autocratic power. This juxtaposition serves both as satire of autocratic rulers and as a serious reflection on political authority. The context contrasts this with other rulers, such as the Brobdingnagian king, who is portrayed as intellectually serious, underscoring the emperor's complex representation.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context offers an extensive overview of mythical hybrid creatures, emphasizing their composite nature\u2014combining features from multiple species, both animal and human. It highlights a wide range of hybrids, from formidable, powerful beings like griffins, centaurs, and chimeras to grotesque or terrifying entities such as the Nuckelavee or Ammit. The text suggests a symbolic function in mythology: hybrids often embody the strongest traits of their constituent species, granting them power, fear, or mystique. Additionally, the diversity of combinations points to rich cultural symbolism\u2014e.g., human-animal hybrids often merge intellect or agency with animalistic strength or attributes, reflecting mythological narratives about human nature, divine power, or chaos. The cataloging of specific hybrids with their composite parts encourages examination of how these physical combinations relate to their mythical roles and symbolic meanings.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that the combination of physical traits carries symbolic weight or functional meaning within mythologies, and that the hybridity embodies a synthesis of powers or qualities beyond mere physical traits. The mention of some hybrids as \"unsavoury beasts\" and others as \"beautiful\" or \"formidable\" suggests a spectrum of symbolic roles\u2014from protective deities to nightmares. The detailed listing invites analysis of how specific animal and human parts correspond to symbolic roles\u2014e.g., heads of predatory animals implying strength or ferocity, human upper bodies suggesting intelligence or agency.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Ten Facts About Fantasia (1940)Ten Facts About Fantasia (1940) [PAR] Previous Facts - Next Facts [PAR] Ten Facts About Walt Disney's Fantasia [PAR] Here are ten facts about Walt Disney's animated  masterpiece from 1940, featuring a compilation of animations accompanied by a soundtrack  of classical music. [PAR] Fact One [PAR] Fantasia was Walt Disney's third feature film, following on from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940) [PAR] Fact Two [PAR] The Sorcerer's Apprentice, perhaps the most famous short of the film Fantasia, starred Mickey Mouse as the, er, Sorcerer's Apprentice. This role was intended as a come-back role for Disney's famous mouse, who was losing out in popularity to Donald Duck. However, also considered for the role of the apprentice was Dopey from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The animation itself was also originally going to be a one-off cartoon, but since it was more expensive to produce than regular Disney cartoons and was unlikely to make any profit, Disney decided to make it part of a collection of animated sequences with classical music accompaniments which could then be released as a feature film. That collection of animated shorts would become Fantasia. [PAR] Fact Three [PAR] The conductor of the music used in Fantasia was Leopold Stokowski. When The Sorcerer's Apprentice was being worked on, Stokowski offered to conduct the orchestra for free. He probably changed his mind when he found out he would be conducting the orchestra for the entire film. [PAR] Fact Four [PAR] Live action sequences shown between the animated segments show an orchestra playing the soundtrack. In those scenes, the orchestra were miming! The music for all sequences apart from The Sorceror's Apprentice was played by Philadelphia Orchestra. In the film, members of the orchestra pretending to play to the pre-recorded music were local musicians and employees of the film studio. [PAR] Fact Five [PAR] The original release of Fantasia featured an intermission which was announced by the film's host, Deems Taylor. The members of the orchestra are seen leaving their seats while the curtains close, both on the film and in the movie theatre showing it. After the intermission, which would have lasted for fifteen minutes, the curtains in the theatre and on the film open and the orchestra are seen to return to their seats, and then have a bit of a jam session.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Six [PAR] Fantasia, which was essentially a way for Walt Disney to show off animation and sound techniques in films, was the first commercial film to have its soundtrack recorded in stereo. It was also planned that parts of it would be shown in widescreen and other parts to be in 3-D, and, to make the film a real treat for the senses, for perfumes to be sprayed into the theatre during the Nutcracker Suite sequence.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Seven [PAR] Nowadays, films are completed weeks, months or even years before they get their premiere. Fantasia however was completed four hours before premiering in New York City on November 13th 1940. The final scene to be produced was flown to New York on the day of the premiere and edited into the film in time for its first showing. [PAR] Fact Eight [PAR] Despite getting generally good reviews, Fantasia was only shown in twelve movie theatres on its first release due to Disney's distribution company RKO initially deciding not to distribute it. The meant that the film could not make a profit, and meant that the budget for Disney's next film, Dumbo, was quite low. The film got a national release a couple of years later, although heavily edited (from the original 125 runtime to 81 minutes) and in mono. Again it was a commercial failure. A release in 1956 restored the stereo soundtrack, although it was only on its release in 1969 that the film finally made a profit, due to its psychedelic nature being popular with the teenage and college student audiences of the time. Its soundtrack was completely rerecorded for a 1982 release. Even the host's introductions to each segment were dubbed over. A 1990 release used the original soundtrack which had been digitally remastered, and a release for 2000 saw several of the original",
    "topic": "The creative and strategic reasons behind selecting Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer's Apprentice and the consideration of Dopey for the role.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context centers primarily on the creative and strategic decisions behind the casting of Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in Fantasia, highlighting the intent to revive Mickey's popularity amid competition from Donald Duck.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] James BondThe James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny. [PAR] The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of , there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series.  There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball). [PAR] The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as \"Bond girls\". [PAR] Publication history [PAR] Creation and inspiration [PAR] As the central figure for his works, Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond, an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. [PAR] Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.  Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job and Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale. [PAR] The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that: [PAR] On another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\" [PAR] Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\" [PAR] Fleming also endowed",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed exploration of the origins and creation of the James Bond character by Ian Fleming, emphasizing Fleming's background in Naval Intelligence during World War II as a key influence. It highlights Fleming's admission that Bond was a composite of various secret agents and commandos he encountered, including his brother Peter and other real-life figures. The text also discusses Fleming's choice of the name \"James Bond,\" derived from an American ornithologist, chosen specifically for its plainness and neutrality to contrast with the exotic adventures of the character. Additionally, the physical inspiration for Bond is noted as a blend of Fleming himself and American singer Hoagy Carmichael, underscoring the deliberate construction of Bond's persona as an anonymous, efficient government agent. The passage touches on the publication history and the broader cultural impact of Bond but focuses primarily on the character's conception and the nuanced influences behind it.\n\nThe implicit assumptions and subtleties include Fleming\u2019s intention to create a character who was a \"blunt instrument\" rather than a flamboyant hero, reflecting a realistic, almost utilitarian view of espionage shaped by his wartime experiences. The choice of a nondescript name and appearance serves to make Bond an everyman figure capable of extraordinary deeds, which is a sophisticated narrative strategy. The references to real individuals behind the character suggest an interplay between fiction and reality, highlighting how historical and personal experiences inform literary creation.\n\nThe difficulty level is rated at 9 due to the need for nuanced understanding of literary character development, historical context, and the psychological and strategic choices Fleming made in crafting Bond. The question should challenge experts to consider how Fleming\u2019s intelligence background concretely shaped Bond\u2019s persona and narrative role, requiring synthesis of biographical, literary, and historical knowledge.\n\nThe question should prompt reflection on the implications of Fleming\u2019s choices for the spy genre and character construction, including the significance of Bond\u2019s anonymity, the blending of real-life inspirations, and the deliberate contrast between Bond\u2019s plainness and his extraordinary exploits. This encourages deep engagement with the relationship between authorial experience and fictional creation.\n\nOverall, the content is rich, meaningful, and educationally valuable for generating a highly challenging question that probes expert understanding of the origins of James Bond in relation to Ian Fleming\u2019s intelligence experience and literary strategy.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How did Ian Fleming\u2019s experiences in Naval Intelligence during World War II specifically influence the characterization of James Bond as an intelligence officer, and what narrative purpose did Fleming\u2019s choice of a plain, unremarkable name serve in shaping Bond\u2019s role within the spy genre?\n\nA: Fleming based Bond\u2019s character on a single real-life spy he admired, and the plain name was chosen to make Bond easily memorable and heroic in the public imagination.\n\nB: Fleming synthesized traits from multiple secret agents he encountered, and the plain name was intended to present Bond as an anonymous, utilitarian government tool contrasting with the exotic nature of his missions.\n\nC: Fleming\u2019s Naval Intelligence role had little impact on Bond\u2019s character, which was mostly inspired by Hollywood spy archetypes, while the plain name was a marketing decision to appeal to American readers.\n\nD: Fleming modeled Bond solely on his brother\u2019s wartime exploits, and the plain name was meant to disguise the character\u2019s aristocratic background and create a mysterious aura.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer reflects that Fleming explicitly stated Bond was a composite of various secret agents and commando types he met during the war, showing a synthesis of real intelligence experiences.

[PAR] After this decision, the \"noise\" in his head subsides.\u00a0 He seems to think more clearly.\u00a0 The final quote--\"the rest is silence\"--could represent the true peace that Hamlet feels as both external and internal noise are gone. [PAR] like 2 dislike 0 [PAR] August 16, 2008 at 9:29 AM [PAR] Hamlet, who speaks the majority of the lines in the play, is about to die and stop speaking for ever. He has avenged his father's murder, been cut with the poisoned rapier, and, as he has just reflected to Horatio, is about to pass the crown of Denmark (he is, at this moment, effectively the only candidate to be king) to Fortinbras. There will be no familial succession. In that sense, the rest is silence for the line of the Hamlets. [PAR] Yet there is (as with so many other things in Hamlet) a meta-theatrical element. Hamlet has just asked Horatio not to commit suicide (Horatio's line 'Here's yet some liquor left' refers to a drop of poison left and his desire to kill himself) but to stay alive and to 'report' Hamlet's story to Fortinbras. [PAR] Hamlet cannot voice his choice for succession nor can he tell his own story: he is about to die; there can only be silence from him. But when the play--itself a version of Hamlet's story--comes to an end, part of Horatio's project, even after the curtain has come down, is to re-tell that same story: [PAR] So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, [PAR] Which have solicited. [PAR] Paraphrase: So tell Fortinbras, with the events and results that came to pass, more or less, which wrongdoing was provoked and incited.

Central ideas include Hamlet\u2019s internal psychological \"noise\" caused by grief, betrayal, and philosophical reflection, which subsides as he accepts fate and nears death. The phrase symbolizes the cessation of both external conflict and internal turmoil, representing peace through silence. Additionally, Hamlet\u2019s death marks the end of his personal lineage and voice, yet the play\u2019s meta-theatrical nature ensures his story continues through Horatio\u2019s narration, suggesting a cyclical perpetuation of the narrative beyond Hamlet\u2019s silence. The analysis incorporates Hamlet\u2019s acceptance of fate, the relinquishing of the Danish crown to Fortinbras, and the transition of storytelling responsibility, highlighting the interplay between silence as finality and the ongoing life of the story through performance and retelling.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the idea that silence is not merely death but a form of resolution or peace after chaos, and that narrative cycles transcend individual mortality. Subtle details involve the contrast between Hamlet\u2019s previously noisy, conflicted mind and his final clarity, and the meta-theatrical dimension of the play as a story within a story.

After Preston, he starred in productions at Wolverhampton, Salisbury and The Old Vic Company at Bristol's Theatre Royal. In 1962 he made his first big-screen appearance in A Kind of Loving, followed by other films throughout the 1960s, including Billy Liar, King Rat and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and TV appearances such as Z Cars, The Avengers and Steptoe and Son. His portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the 1969 play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui made him a West End star.

[PAR] Three of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer.. [PAR] Prime Meridian [PAR] While the equator divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres , it is the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude and the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian (near the International Date Line ) at 180 degrees longitude that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres . The Eastern Hemisphere consists of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia while the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America . Some geographers place the boundaries between the hemispheres at 20\u00b0 West and 160\u00b0 East so as to not run through Europe and Africa. Unlike the equator and the Tropic of Cancer and",

The series is a satirical depiction of a working class lifestyle epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and many aspects of the human condition. It's the 20th Century Fox debut in animation. [PAR] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390). [PAR] Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the series has broadcast  episodes. It will begin airing its 28th season in September 2016. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American scripted primetime television series. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. On May 4, 2015, the series was officially renewed for seasons twenty-seven (2015\u201316) and twenty-eight (2016\u201317), consisting of 22 episodes each.   [PAR] The Simpsons has received widespread critical acclaim, especially for the \"Golden Age\" of approximately its first ten seasons. Time magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,  and The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\".   On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms. Despite this, the show has also been criticized for what many perceive as a decline in quality over the years. [PAR] Premise [PAR] Characters [PAR] The Simpsons are a family who live in a fictional \"Middle American\" town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.  The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\".  Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. [PAR] The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV.

After an affair and secretly impregnating Leto, Leto had to give birth to Aretmis while being chased by the Python sent by Hera. Fortunately for Leto her first child, Artemis, was birthed without any pain. However Leto had twins so her labor continued, and as weak as she was the newborn Artemis quickly took the roll as midwife and helped birth her twin brother Apollo. You could say that, of all the Greek goddesses, the goddess Artemis was literally born to serve as a nurturer and protector! It looks like though both twins had young knacks for things. [PAR] On her birthday Artemis asked for Six wishes from Zeus, his father. These wishes were. [PAR] 1.      To be able to live life chaste. [PAR] 2.

Stags to lead her chariot. [PAR] 6.      And 80 virgin nymphs to be her hunting companions. [PAR] Zeus was amused by wishes and being the good father granted her each wish she asked for. Artemis would never marry, and would be chaste for all eternity. She roamed with her hunting dogs, nymphs, and her stags, hunting all throughout the mountains where she resided. [PAR] Artemis was very protective of the chastity of her nymphs and was angered when they didn\u2019t keep their purity. In the case of Callisto, Zeus had disguised himself as Artemis and took advantage and impregnated Callisto, Artemis was furious that she was no longer chaste and blamed her loss of purity on her. Artemis then immediately irrevocably turned her into a bear. However before Artemis killed Callisto in bear form Zeus intervened turning Callisto into constellation in the stars, as Callisto the Bear, also known as Ursa Major. [PAR] The Greek goddess Artemis was frequently called upon to nurture her needy and somewhat ineffectual mother.  Many times she came to the aid of her mother healing her from sickness. Artemis very naturally became the patron saint of childbirth, the protector of children, and the goddess who especially heard the appeals of women.

Key points include Artemis being born painlessly while their mother Leto was pursued by the Python, and Artemis acting as a midwife to Apollo despite being a newborn herself. This establishes Artemis\u2019s intrinsic association with nurturing and childbirth, a rare characteristic for a goddess also known for hunting and chastity. The text also touches on Artemis\u2019s wishes to Zeus, emphasizing her unique vow of chastity and independence, which contrast with her nurturing role.

The text also touches on historical and hosting details but these are less relevant to the question topic.\n\nThe nuanced theme involves the layered governance structure: IFs establish qualification standards while NOCs exercise discretion in athlete selection, within the framework of quota limits. The interplay between international federation rules and national committee decisions is critical, reflecting a balance of standardized global competition and national representation autonomy.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that IFs possess the technical expertise to set fair and sport-specific qualification standards, and that NOCs act strategically in final team composition.

If the skin of a typical 150-pound (68-kilogram) adult male were stretched out flat, it would cover about 2 square yards (1.7 square meters) and weigh about 9 pounds (4 kilograms). Our skin protects the network of muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and everything else inside our bodies. Our eyelids have the thinnest skin, the soles of our feet the thickest. [PAR] Hair is actually a modified type of skin. Hair grows everywhere on the human body except the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips. Hair grows more quickly in summer than winter, and more slowly at night than during the day. [PAR] Like hair, nails are a type of modified skin. Nails protect the sensitive tips of fingers and toes. Human nails aren't necessary for living, but they do provide support for the tips of the fingers and toes, protect them from injury, and aid in picking up small objects. Without them, we'd have a hard time scratching an itch or untying a knot. Nails can be an indicator of a person's general health, and illness often affects their growth. [PAR] continue [PAR] Skin Basics [PAR] Skin is essential in many ways. It forms a barrier that prevents harmful substances and microorganisms from entering the body. It protects body tissues against injury. It also controls the loss of life-sustaining fluids like blood and water, helps regulate body temperature through perspiration (sweating), and protects from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays. [PAR] Without the nerve cells in skin, people couldn't feel warmth, cold, or other sensations. For instance, goosebumps form when the erector pili muscles contract to make hairs on the skin stand up straight when someone is cold, excited,\u00a0or frightened \u2014 the blood vessels keep the body from losing heat by narrowing as much as possible and keeping the warm blood away from the skin's surface, offering insulation and protection. [PAR] Every square inch of skin contains thousands of cells and hundreds of sweat glands, oil glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels. Skin is made up of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous tissue. [PAR] The upper layer of our skin, the epidermis, is the tough, protective outer layer. It's about as thick as a sheet of paper over most parts of the body. The epidermis has four layers of cells that are constantly flaking off and being renewed. In these four layers are three special types of cells: [PAR] Melanocytes produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. All people have roughly the same number of melanocytes; the more melanin that is produced, the darker the skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the production of melanin, which is why people get suntanned or freckled. [PAR] Keratinocytes produce keratin, a type of protein that is a basic component of hair, skin, nails, and helps create an intact barrier. [PAR] Langerhans cells help protect the body against infection. [PAR] Because the cells in the epidermis are completely replaced about every 28 days, cuts and scrapes heal quickly. [PAR] Below the epidermis is the next layer of our skin, the dermis, which is made up of blood vessels, nerve endings, and connective tissue. The dermis nourishes the epidermis. Two types of fibers in the dermis \u2014 collagen and elastin \u2014 help the skin stretch when we bend and reposition itself when we straighten up. Collagen is strong and hard to stretch, and elastin, as its name suggests, is elastic. In older people, some of the elastin-containing fibers degenerate, which is one reason why the skin looks wrinkled. [PAR] The dermis also contains a person's sebaceous glands. These glands, which surround and empty into hair follicles and pores, produce the oil sebum that lubricates the skin and hair. Sebaceous glands are found mostly in the skin on the face, upper back, shoulders, and chest. [PAR] Most",

It highlights that all humans have roughly the same number of melanocytes, but the amount of melanin produced determines skin darkness. Importantly, exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet radiation) increases melanin production, leading to tanning or freckling. The context also mentions the protective role of skin against UV damage. The relationship between melanin production, skin pigmentation, and UV exposure is central here. This allows exploration of how evolutionary and physiological mechanisms regulate pigmentation in response to environmental UV levels. The complexity of this relationship involves understanding cellular biology (melanocytes and melanin synthesis), evolutionary adaptation, and protective mechanisms against UV-induced harm.

To dam the great Zambezi floodplain was in many ways a hopeful leap into the future. Vast areas of forest and scrub would be inundated. Literally thousands of wild animals would lose their habitats and, more importantly, the local villages would have to be relocated.

[PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The vegetation was strip cleared and burnt, making the lake rich in chemicals from the fired wood and the considerable number of remaining trees provided an essential habitat for many creatures that found their way into the lake. [PAR] Building the dam wall began in the late 1950s. Well over a million cubic metres of concrete was poured into the 36.6 metre high wall with a thickness of over twenty four metres to sustain the pressure of nearly ten million litres of water passing through the spillway each second. At the end of 1958, the sluice gates were closed and in 1963 the maximum level was reached.

It enters the Indian Ocean in Mozambique at Quelimane. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] It flows for some 2 650 kilometers from its source to the Indian Ocean. It is the fourth largest river in Africa flowing into the Indian Ocean. [PAR] Kariba Dam is located approximately halfway down the Zambezi River. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] The Electricity Supply Commission instigated an investigation for possible hydroelectric schemes to be situated at kariba and in 1941 funds were allocated. As a result of this survey, a river gauging station was set up at chirundu as well as at a campsite 25 kilometers downstream from the present dam wall. [PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Both Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) were in contention as it was thought that the Kafue River Gorge site in Northern Rhodesia was preferable to kariba. The matter was solved in 1951 by a board of experts known as \u201cthe Panel\u201d who all agreed that the dam be built on the Zambezi River, at the Kariba Gorge site.

[PAR] On his first day at school Bernard crossed swords with caretaker Norman Potter (Deryck Guyler), a former Desert Rat with delusions of grandeur, although with some credibility as he was the right hand man of incompetent headmaster, Maurice Cromwell (Noel Howlett), who in turn was the subject of infatuation by formidable deputy head Doris Ewell (Joan Sanderson). This trio virtually ran the school much to the resignation of the rest of the disillusioned staff and the last thing they wanted to disturb the balance was a young schoolmaster fresh out of teachers training college and full of bright ideals about modern teaching. [PAR] In order to curb Bernard's na\u00efve enthusiasm it was conspired between the trio to give him a class of 'no-hopers', namely 5C. In their last year at school the pupils of this class were an uneducable bunch of delinquents who were simply biding their time until the final bell sounded on the last day of term. This of course did not involve participating in any school activities such as lessons. However, through a series of (comical) events Bernard managed to win over not only the staff but also the class of pupils (who nicknamed him 'Privet' Hedges) that contained 'hard case' Patrick Duffy (Peter Cleall), the tough talking but wimpish Frankie (Hank) Abbott (David Barry), slow witted Dennis Dunstable (Peter Denyer), flirtatious Sharon (Penny Spencer in the first two season's, Carol Hawkins thereafter), and Maureen (Liz Gebhart), who had a crush on her teacher. Support on the teacher front came from Richard Davies who gave a first class performance as the down to earth no-nonsense Welsh science teacher, Mr Price, and the aging Eric Chitty as Mr Smith, a teacher that was clearly beyond retirement age at the series outset. In fact most of the actors who played the students were already in their twenties when Please Sir! began in 1968 and two years later (at the end of the longest last year in school history) the pupils were clearly showing their age. [PAR] The series made stars of several actors although oddly none of the students found lasting television fame. LWT Head of Light Entertainment, Frank Muir, cast Alderton as Bernard Hedges after he had spotted him as a teacher in the opening episode of Never A Cross Word. After leaving Fenn Street School the actor went on to several successful series such as Upstairs, Downstairs, it's spin-off series Thomas and Sarah, the LWT sitcom No-Honestly and a series of Wodehouse plays (Wodehouse Playhouse) for BBC (all of which Alderton co-starred alongside his wife, Pauline Collins), and the BBC sitcom My Wife Next Door with Hannah Gordon. Joan Sanderson won television immortality as Mrs Richards, the hotel guest with hearing problems in Fawlty Towers and after Please Sir! had finished she teamed up again with Deryck Guyler (who was originally cast as Fenn Street's headmaster) on a BBC radio show (also penned by the same writers), You're Only Young Once. [PAR] A 1971 feature movie was released in which Bernard meets and begins to date Penny Wheeler (Jill Kerman), and this was carried on in subsequent TV series of Please Sir! and its predecessor, The Fenn Street Gang (which in turn spawned Bowler), which briefly followed the fortunes of the pupils after they left school. [PAR] The series was the creation of former school chums and a new-to-television comedy writing team of John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, who went on to write Get Some In!; Ever Decreasing Circles; As Time Goes By and the enormously successful The Good Life.

They reached the Moon on July 20, and later that day as millions watched on televisions around the world, Neil Armstrong left the lunar lander to become the first man to set foot on the Moon. Together the two men took images, rock samples, and did some scientific experiments for a few hours before returning to the Eagle lander for the final time. They left the Moon (after 21 hours and 36 minutes) to return to the Columbia command module, where Michael Collins had stayed behind. They returned to Earth to a hero's welcome and the rest is history!\u00a0 [PAR] Why Go to the Moon? [PAR] Ostensibly, the purposes of the manned lunar missions were to study the internal structure of the Moon, surface composition, how the surface structure was formed and the age of the Moon. They would also investigate traces of volcanic activity, the rate of solid objects hitting the moon, presence of any magnetic fields, and tremors. Samples would also be gathered of lunar soil and detected gases. That was the scientific case for what was also a technological challenge.\u00a0 [PAR] Starting the Road to the Moon [PAR] The early manned flights of the Mercury and Gemini missions had demonstrated that humans could survive in space.

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. [PAR] Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623.

And he should be brainy \u2013 he should have little grey cells of the mind. [PAR] Agatha Christie - An Autobiography [PAR] About Hercule Poirot [PAR] The Beginning [PAR] Hercule Poirot came into existence during World War I. Agatha Christie was working as a VAD in Torquay, and encountered on a daily basis Belgian refugees arriving in England from the continent. Searching for a detective for her first novel, she set upon the idea of creating a Belgian detective who had been \"a former shining light of the Belgian police force\", before being forced out of his country. [PAR] Christie completed The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, but it wasn\u2019t published until four years later. In the novel, Poirot is called upon by his old friend Lieutenant Hastings, who would come to be the Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Christie later wrote that Poirot's introduction to detective fiction was not at all how he himself would have liked. \"Hercule Poirot first,\" he would have said, \"and then a plot to display his remarkable talents to their best advantage.\" [PAR] A Great Man [PAR] Poirot would be the first to call himself a great man - he has never been known for his modesty - but with such success in his career, it is difficult to argue with him. He finishes each case with a dramatic d\u00e9nouement, satisfying his own ego and confirming to all that he is truly \"the greatest mind in Europe.\" His love of elegance, beauty, and precision, as well as his eccentric mannerisms are often ridiculed by the local bumbling policemen, but it is always Poirot who has the last word. [PAR] My name is Hercule Poirot, and I am probably the greatest detective in the world. [PAR] Hercule Poirot, The Mystery of the Blue Train [PAR] Agatha Christie never imagined how popular Poirot would become, nor how many stories she would write about him. He stars in 33 novels and 54 short stories, including some of Christie's most successful such as Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile . [PAR] Poirot and Christie [PAR] One of Christie\u2019s later regrets was that Hercule Poirot began his literary life too mature: \"the result is that my fictional detective is well over a hundred by now.\" And it is no secret that character and author did not always see eye to eye.

A reluctant affection has sprung up for him\u2026\u201d Agatha Christie\u2019s introduction to the serialisation of Appointment With Death in the Daily Mail, 1938. [PAR] Christie grew tired of Poirot's idiosyncrasies so much so that she wrote Curtain: Poirot's Last Case in the 1940s. It was locked in a safe until 1974 when it was finally published, earning Poirot a well-deserved obituary in The New York Times; he is the only fictional character to have received such an honour. [PAR] Playing Poirot [PAR] The first actor to take on the role of the little Belgian was Charles Laughton in 1928 in the theatrical debut of Alibi. Austin Trevor was the first Poirot on screen in 1931, and went on to star in three films. There was Tony Randall in 1965 and Academy Award nominee Albert Finney in the all-star classic Murder on the Orient Express in 1974. The great Peter Ustinov, winner of two Academy Awards, played Poirot in six films and despite not physically resembling the character is still much loved worldwide. There was even a Japanese anim\u00e9 version of Poirot, broadcast in 2004. [PAR] Perhaps, however, the actor most synonymous with Hercule Poirot is David Suchet, who first took on the role in 1989.

The adverts feature Aleksandr Orlov, a CGI fictional anthropomorphic Russian meerkat and his family and friends. Orlov is portrayed as being of aristocratic stock and the founder of comparethemeerkat.com: the campaign centres on his frustration over the confusion between his website and comparethemarket.com, playing on the similarity between the words market and meerkat. Orlov's catchphrase is \"Simples\". [PAR] The campaign, launched on 5 January 2009, was created by advertising agency, VCCP and production company Passion Pictures. The adverts proved popular and became a commercial success for comparethemarket.com, which became the fourth most visited insurance website in the UK as a result. A book featuring Orlov was published in 2010, and other merchandise has been created in tandem with the ongoing campaign. [PAR] Campaign [PAR] The campaign, designed by ad-agency VCCP, was launched in 2009, involving a TV spot, companion website and social media links. The advert featured Alexsandr Orlov, a CGI animated fictional anthropomorphic Russian meerkat, who complains at the confusion between his site, comparethemeerkat.com, and comparethemarket.com. The character explains that he has launched a TV advertising campaign to make visitors aware of the difference. The companion website, comparethemeerkat.com, was created alongside the TV advert and in 2010 was receiving more than 2 million hits per month.  [PAR] The TV spots, and the characters, were directed by Darren Walsh at Passion Pictures. Walsh has directed all of the meerkat television and cinema commercials to date, and has won several awards for the work. In the adverts, Orlov is voiced by Simon Greenall.  [PAR] In August 2009 an opinion piece in The Guardian newspaper accused the advert series of racism for mocking Eastern European accents. However, the Advertising Standards Authority, following a complaint by the author of the article, stated that it had not received any similar complaints.  [PAR] In November 2012, Compare the Market began sponsoring the long-running soap opera Coronation Street as part of a three-year deal with producers of the series. [PAR] In April 2015, comparethemarket.com launched Meerkat Movies, offering customers two-for-one cinema tickets. They partnered with films such as  [PAR] Terminator Genisys and Ant-Man. The advertisements featured the movie trailer, sometimes an interview between Orlov and the cast, and a comment that the movie tickets are two-for-one with Meerkat Movies. [PAR] Characters [PAR] The adverts are fronted by Aleksandr Orlov, a meerkat. According to an interview with the character's designer and director, Darren Walsh at Passion Pictures, Orlov became a billionaire in the 1970s. He is described as living in Moscow, while owning a large mansion in South London, and spends his time on vanity projects such as his website, numerous self-portraits, petitions and film production. [PAR] The campaign has also featured secondary characters from amongst Orlov's friends, family and employees. Most notably Sergei, Orlov's sidekick and technician who has also featured in his own adverts. In the adverts, Sergei is Orlov's IT technician, tea-maker and sidekick. Before working for Aleksandr, he used to be head of the principal design group for the Soviet space programme during the 1980s. He designed the Meer(kat) Space Station, and now works with Orlov and 'Compare the Meerkat'. Sergei is first seen in the ad \"Sergei\", and later guests in \"Jacuzzi\", \"Art Class\" and all three of the 'Orlov Family Trilogy' advertisements. Sergei had been frequently mentioned on Orlov's Twitter and Facebook accounts, one time was prior to being included in an advert, and Aleksandr even started a petition to add the word 'Simples' to the dictionary because Sergei didn't approve of the word in a game of Scrabble.  Sergei has also starred in his own adverts without Orlov. [PAR] The 2011 campaign focused on a fictional Russian village named Meerkovo.

The show is set in a bar named Cheers (named after its real life counterpart) in Boston, Massachusetts, where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize.  The show's main theme song, written and performed by Gary Portnoy, and co-written with Judy Hart Angelo, lent its famous refrain \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" as the show's tagline.  [PAR] After premiering on September 30, 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked almost last in ratings for its premiere (74th out of 77 shows). Cheers, however, eventually became a highly rated television show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at number one. The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night \"Must See TV\" lineup. Its widely watched series finale was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 270 episodes have been successfully syndicated worldwide.  Nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series for all eleven of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations.

The text notes the song's later cultural impact, such as its resurgence in popularity due to a Guinness commercial 25 years later. This suggests that secondary musical themes can have a lasting emotional and cultural resonance distinct from the main title songs.

[PAR] Hamlet cannot voice his choice for succession nor can he tell his own story: he is about to die; there can only be silence from him.

ISBN 0-7613-1367-2. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.  [PAR] Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the continents;   the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.  Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster \u2013 with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago.  Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.  [PAR] Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. In the late 19th century European countries colonized most of Africa. Most present states in Africa originate from a process of decolonization in the 20th century. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya).   This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Hebrew or Phoenician  'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers.  The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.  [PAR] Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of Africa Proconsularis, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.  The Latin suffix \"-ica\" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name. [PAR] According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while \"Asia\" was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85\u2013165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of \"Africa\" expanded with their knowledge. [PAR] Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name \"Africa\": [PAR] * The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya. [PAR] * Isidore of Seville in Etymologiae XIV.5.2. suggests \"Africa comes from the Latin aprica, meaning \"sunny\".

His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring . At the time of his death, Sm\u00e9agol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a Hobbit , but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains in the book The Hobbit. In the movies, he was a deuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.

Around the year TA 2463 , Sm\u00e9agol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron , Isildur , and D\u00e9agol . D\u00e9agol was his cousin, and on Sm\u00e9agol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that D\u00e9agol found a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sm\u00e9agol fell to the power of the ring and demanded it as a birthday present. When De\u00e1gol refused, Sm\u00e9agol promptly flew into a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him to death and taking the ring as his own. Sm\u00e9agol was quickly corrupted further by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470 . The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits. He called it his \"Precious\" or his \"Birthday Present,\" the latter as a justification for killing D\u00e9agol. [PAR] Life under the Misty Mountains [PAR] Gollum in The Hobbit [PAR] He lived in the Misty Mountains for over four hundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small row boat), bats and Goblins when he could get them. Indeed, he made a song about raw fish, that he uses as a riddle to Bilbo and much later sings to Frodo in a longer version. In later years, he found Hobbit and Elven food repulsive. [PAR] During his centuries under the Ring's influence, he developed a sort of dissociative identity disorder : Sm\u00e9agol, his \"good\" personality, still vaguely remembered things like friendship and love, while Gollum, his \"bad\" personality, was a slave to the Ring and would kill anyone who tried to take it. Years later, Samwise Gamgee would name the good personality \"Slinker\" (for his fawning, eager-to-please demeanor), and the bad personality \"Stinker\".

Central ideas include the corrupting power of the Ring that twisted Sm\u00e9agol into Gollum physically and mentally, extending his life unnaturally; the duality of Gollum's personality reflecting the conflict between his residual Hobbit nature and the Ring's enslavement; and the pivotal moment when Bilbo finds the Ring in the Misty Mountains, which marks a crucial turning point in both Gollum's arc and the larger narrative. The text explicitly links Bilbo's finding of the Ring to Gollum's obsessive pursuit of it, highlighting the Ring's agency (\"it was more proper to say that the Ring abandoned Gollum\"). This suggests thematic implications around fate, possession, and the Ring's own malevolent will.\n\nImplicitly, the context reveals themes of identity fragmentation, the nature of evil as both external (the Ring) and internal (Gollum/Sm\u00e9agol's split), and the narrative function of Bilbo's discovery as a catalyst for the unfolding of the greater saga.

He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon\u2019s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 1799, during Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt, a French soldier named Pierre Francois Bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the Rosetta Stone. This artifact provided the key to cracking the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years. [PAR] As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. [PAR] In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. [PAR] In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general. [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Rise to Power [PAR] Since 1792, France\u2019s revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various European nations. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria, one of his country\u2019s primary rivals, in a series of battles in Italy. In 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French. [PAR] The following year, the Directory, the five-person group that had governed France since 1795, offered to let Napoleon lead an invasion of England. Napoleon determined that France\u2019s naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior British Royal Navy. Instead, he proposed an invasion of Egypt in an effort to wipe out British trade routes with India. Napoleon\u2019s troops scored a victory against Egypt\u2019s military rulers, the Mamluks, at the Battle of the Pyramids in July 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the British at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. In early 1799, Napoleon\u2019s army launched an invasion of Ottoman-ruled Syria, which ended with the failed siege of Acre, located in modern-day Israel. That summer, with the political situation in France marked by uncertainty, the ever-ambitious and cunning Napoleon opted to abandon his army in Egypt and return to France. [PAR] The Coup of 18 Brumaire [PAR] In November 1799, in an event known as the coup of 18 Brumaire, Napoleon was part of a group that successfully overthrew the French Directory. [PAR] The Directory was replaced with a three-member Consulate, and Napoleon became first consul, making him France\u2019s leading political figure. In June 1800, at the Battle of Marengo, Napoleon\u2019s forces defeated",

The name Gollum was derived from the sound of his disgusting gurgling, choking cough. His birth can be estimated to have happened in the year TA 2430 . His death date is given as March 25 , 3019 . His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring . At the time of his death, Sm\u00e9agol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a creature that was once a Hobbit , but he had been deformed and twisted in both body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was to possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many years after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains in the book The Hobbit. In the movies, he was a deuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.

Around the year TA 2463 , Sm\u00e9agol became the fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron , Isildur , and D\u00e9agol . D\u00e9agol was his cousin, and on Sm\u00e9agol's birthday, they went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that D\u00e9agol found a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish. Almost immediately, Sm\u00e9agol fell to the power of the ring and demanded it as a birthday present. When De\u00e1gol refused, Sm\u00e9agol promptly flew into a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him to death and taking the ring as his own. Sm\u00e9agol was quickly corrupted further by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his grandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in the Misty Mountains in around TA 2470 . The Ring's malignant influence twisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far beyond its natural limits.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed account of Gollum\u2019s early life, emphasizing the significant influence of his grandmother and his life before exile, which are crucial in understanding his complex character development. Central ideas include Gollum\u2019s origin as a Stoor Hobbit living under a matriarchal family structure, specifically his grandmother\u2019s authority, which frames his early social environment. The narrative highlights the pivotal moment when Sm\u00e9agol kills his cousin D\u00e9agol to obtain the One Ring, marking the beginning of his moral and physical corruption. The grandmother\u2019s role in banishing Sm\u00e9agol after this crime illustrates the social and familial rejection that contributes to his isolation and transformation into Gollum. The text also delves into the psychological fragmentation he experiences under the Ring\u2019s influence, developing dissociative identities that reflect internal conflict and trauma rooted in his early life and exile.\n\nImplicit assumptions and nuanced themes include the impact of familial and societal structures on identity formation, the psychological consequences of trauma and isolation, and how early relational dynamics with his grandmother and community shaped his susceptibility to the Ring\u2019s corruption. The grandmother\u2019s rejection is a catalyst for his exile, which leads to his physical and mental transformation. This suggests that Gollum\u2019s character is not solely a product of the Ring\u2019s malign influence but also deeply intertwined with his pre-exile social context and family dynamics.\n\nThe difficulty level is rated at 9 because the question requires an expert-level synthesis of character psychology, social anthropology of Hobbit culture, and Tolkien\u2019s thematic use of family and exile in shaping identity. It demands understanding the interplay between early environmental factors and supernatural corruption, challenging experts to integrate literary analysis with psychological and sociocultural insights.\n\nThe question is designed to provoke reflection on how early familial authority and social rejection influenced Gollum\u2019s psychological fragmentation and moral decline, encouraging a nuanced discussion on the layered causes behind his tragic character arc rather than a simplistic attribution to the Ring\u2019s power alone.\n\nHence, the question will focus on the grandmother\u2019s influence and the early exile\u2019s role in shaping Gollum\u2019s identity, asking which aspect most critically contributed to his eventual psychological split and corruption, prompting the expert to discern subtle causality in Tolkien\u2019s narrative.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How did the authority of Gollum\u2019s grandmother and his subsequent exile before fully succumbing to the One Ring\u2019s power critically influence the psychological fragmentation and moral corruption that define his character?\n\nA: The grandmother\u2019s authority imposed strict social norms that suppressed Sm\u00e9agol\u2019s darker impulses, and her rejection after the murder forced his isolation, which, combined with the Ring\u2019s influence, catalyzed his dissociative identity disorder and moral decay.\n\nB: The grandmother\u2019s protection shielded Sm\u00e9agol from the Ring\u2019s influence initially, but exile severed this protection, allowing the Ring alone to corrupt him physically and mentally without any prior social or psychological impact.\n\nC: The grandmother\u2019s indifference to Sm\u00e9agol\u2019s actions allowed him to embrace the Ring\u2019s power freely, and exile was a minor event that did not significantly affect his psychological state or moral choices.\n\nD: The grandmother\u2019s influence was mainly emotional support that delayed Sm\u00e9agol\u2019s corruption, and exile only contributed to his physical transformation, not to his psychological fragmentation or moral decline.\n\nExplanation: The grandmother\u2019s authority enforced social boundaries that Sm\u00e9agol violated by murdering D\u00e9agol, leading to his banishment and isolation; this social rejection was a critical factor in his psychological break, which, alongside the Ring\u2019s corrupting power, caused his dissociative identities and moral collapse.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village.

Crucially, it ends with highlighting the politicization of the Olympics in the late 20th century, specifically referencing the 1972 Munich terrorist attack on Israeli athletes and the subsequent 1980 Moscow Olympics boycott by sixty nations protesting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This transition from a primarily athletic and cultural event to a stage for political conflict is the core theme relevant to the question topic.\n\nThe nuanced theme involves how political tensions and global conflicts began to intrude decisively on the Olympic movement, disrupting the ideal of peaceful international competition. This shift complicates the Olympic ideal and raises questions about the implications of geopolitical conflicts on global sporting events. The relationship between political actions (terrorism, boycotts) and Olympic participation is central.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the view that the Olympics had been largely apolitical or less politically fraught before these events, that the Games serve as a global stage susceptible to political expression, and that such politicization represents a significant challenge to the Olympic movement\u2019s foundational ideals.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

Central to the analysis is M's skepticism and apparent disfavor toward the relevance of the 00 agents, including Bond, reflecting themes of agency modernization and bureaucratic underfunding. M's viewpoint contrasts with Bond's own frustration at being sidelined into a teaching role, which suggests tension between traditional espionage methods and new administrative or political priorities. The context also touches upon operational details such as Bond's forced physical rehabilitation and reactivation of the 00 section under duress, illustrating a reluctant acknowledgment of the necessity of such agents in the face of emerging threats.

[PAR] Campaign [PAR] The campaign, designed by ad-agency VCCP, was launched in 2009, involving a TV spot, companion website and social media links. The advert featured Alexsandr Orlov, a CGI animated fictional anthropomorphic Russian meerkat, who complains at the confusion between his site, comparethemeerkat.com, and comparethemarket.com. The character explains that he has launched a TV advertising campaign to make visitors aware of the difference. The companion website, comparethemeerkat.com, was created alongside the TV advert and in 2010 was receiving more than 2 million hits per month.  [PAR] The TV spots, and the characters, were directed by Darren Walsh at Passion Pictures. Walsh has directed all of the meerkat television and cinema commercials to date, and has won several awards for the work. In the adverts, Orlov is voiced by Simon Greenall.

[PAR] Characters [PAR] The adverts are fronted by Aleksandr Orlov, a meerkat. According to an interview with the character's designer and director, Darren Walsh at Passion Pictures, Orlov became a billionaire in the 1970s. He is described as living in Moscow, while owning a large mansion in South London, and spends his time on vanity projects such as his website, numerous self-portraits, petitions and film production. [PAR] The campaign has also featured secondary characters from amongst Orlov's friends, family and employees. Most notably Sergei, Orlov's sidekick and technician who has also featured in his own adverts. In the adverts, Sergei is Orlov's IT technician, tea-maker and sidekick. Before working for Aleksandr, he used to be head of the principal design group for the Soviet space programme during the 1980s. He designed the Meer(kat) Space Station, and now works with Orlov and 'Compare the Meerkat'. Sergei is first seen in the ad \"Sergei\", and later guests in \"Jacuzzi\", \"Art Class\" and all three of the 'Orlov Family Trilogy' advertisements. Sergei had been frequently mentioned on Orlov's Twitter and Facebook accounts, one time was prior to being included in an advert, and Aleksandr even started a petition to add the word 'Simples' to the dictionary because Sergei didn't approve of the word in a game of Scrabble.

The campaign cleverly plays on the phonetic similarity between \"meerkat\" and \"market.\" The character and his associates are depicted with Russian cultural markers, including accents and backstories linked to Soviet and Russian themes. The campaign achieved commercial success and extended its reach with merchandise, social media, and sponsorships.\n\nA critical element is the cultural and ethical dimension: an opinion piece accused the adverts of racism for mocking Eastern European accents. However, the Advertising Standards Authority did not receive similar complaints, indicating controversy but not formal adjudication.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Tower BridgeTower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built in 1886\u20131894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets. [PAR] The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. [PAR] The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway. The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge. [PAR] History [PAR] Inception [PAR] In the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the East End of London led to a requirement for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London. [PAR] A Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect (who was also one of the judges),  was approved. [PAR] Jones' engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry, devised the idea of a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. [PAR] Construction [PAR] Construction started in 1887 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.  \u2013 and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. [PAR] Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance. [PAR] Jones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa\u00e7ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was \u00a31,184,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ). [PAR] Opening [PAR] The bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by The Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife, The Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark).

Before attending his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , Harry routinely stayed in his bedroom with Hedwig, away from the Dursleys , since she was his only friend at 4 Privet Drive . [4] Throughout her life, Hedwig provided Harry with mail service, as well as loyal companionship. Hedwig often showed Harry her affection by gently nibbling his ears and fingers, and seemed fully capable of understanding his wishes (as she faithfully followed Harry's orders to peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger until they responded to him). [PAR] Hedwig with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley [PAR] Hedwig was also highly intelligent, as she flew to France completely of her own accord while Hermione was on holiday there with her parents, just to ensure that Harry received a gift from her for his thirteenth birthday, later arriving at the Leaky Cauldron shortly after Harry stormed out of Privet Drive after a particularly bad argument despite the fact that she had been away and allegedly staying with the Weasleys when Harry left the Dursleys. According to the landlord, Tom , she arrived five minutes after he did. [5] She was also able to deliver letters even though there was no specific address given(only a name). Hedwig was a proud creature, and had a habit of staring or hooting \"reproachfully,\" and showing Harry her tail, cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended by his words or actions. She also seemed fairly disdainful of the hyperactive behaviour of Ron Weasley 's pet owl Pigwidgion (Pig, as Ron called him) [PAR] Harry having Hedwig deliver a message to Sirius Black [PAR] While living with the Dursleys , Hedwig was locked in her cage for months at a time to prevent Harry from sending messages to his \"freaky little friends.\" As a result, the first holidays after Hogwarts were a frustrating and boring time for her, as much as for Harry.

In 1992 when Harry thought his friends had forgotten him, he mused that Hedwig was the only reason he knew that discovering the wizarding world had not just been a dream. Fortunately, her frustrated hooting during her first year with them convinced the Dursleys to subsequently let Harry let Hedwig out for flights so long as he didn't use her to send messages, though Harry sometimes ignored this rule and possibly began ignoring it entirely after meeting Sirius Black and gaining leverage with the Dursleys.

Central to the analysis is Hedwig\u2019s captivity by the Dursleys, during which she was locked in her cage for months to prevent Harry from communicating with his friends. This captivity had a dual impact: it caused frustration and boredom for Hedwig, reflecting a decline in her wellbeing, and it symbolized the emotional and social isolation Harry experienced at the Dursleys. The text also emphasizes Hedwig\u2019s affectionate and responsive nature, underscoring the significance of her companionship for Harry, especially as his only friend at Privet Drive. The narrative suggests that Hedwig\u2019s confinement was detrimental both to her natural behaviors and to the emotional support she provided Harry, as evidenced by her hooting that eventually pressured the Dursleys to allow her limited freedom.\n\nImplicit in this is the idea that Hedwig\u2019s wellbeing was closely tied to her ability to fulfill her natural roles\u2014flying freely, delivering messages, and engaging with Harry\u2014which captivity severely restricted.

The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. [PAR] The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978\u201392). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958\u201366), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967\u201392). [PAR] Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u201362) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u201374). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. [PAR] All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. [PAR] Background [PAR] \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". [PAR] The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.) [PAR] The stock-in-trade of Carry On humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (Nurse, Doctor, Again Doctor, Matron), the monarchy (Henry), the Empire (Up the Khyber), the armed forces (Sergeant) and the trade unions (At Your Convenience) as well as the Hammer horror film (Screaming), camping (Camping), foreigners (Abroad), beauty contests (Girls), and caravan holidays (Behind) among others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they proved very popular with audiences.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen English counties and cover 9.3% of England, with no national park in the central counties. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land.

It is said that the two most well-known political parties in American are the Democrats and Republicans. Surprising to some, the two parties are represented by the symbols of a donkey and an elephant (respectively). [PAR] Initially these animal symbols were used on campaign  banners, but over the years they have become two of the most outstanding logos  in American politics allowing candidates to introduce their US political  logo designs . Let\u2019s take a look at the brief history behind these two political logos. We\u2019ll also review how these two animal symbols came to represent the two of the biggest political parties of US. [PAR] The Democratic Donkey [PAR] The Democrats were first to use the donkey as their representative symbol. The donkey represents the Democrats\u2019 beginning 1828.\u00a0 The running President of 1828 was President Andrew Jackson and he was labeled as a \u201cjackass\u201d due to his populist views and stubborn nature. His main slogan was, \u201cLet the people rule.\u201d Although the cartoon was depicted to mock him, it was later adopted by Jackson himself to represent his Democratic party in 1837. [PAR] The Republican Elephant [PAR] Some believe that being a Republican influenced Thomas Nast on choosing a bull elephant to represent his party. However, the Republican elephant was not as intentional as Jackson\u2019s donkey. It was formed through a series of events involving New York\u2019s two popular magazines, The Herald and The Harper\u2019s Weekly. The Herald once ran a story of zoo animals being let loose and roaming in New York\u2019s Central Park looking for prey. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a cartoon of a donkey wearing lion\u2019s skin, chasing away all the animals (given below). This cartoon was a metaphor for President Ulysses S. Grant whom was running for third term presidency and there was a significant amount of conflict in the Democratic Party. This was one reason that the cartoon included a panicked elephant bearing the label, \u201cRepublican Vote.\u201d \u00a0Ever since then, the elephant became the Republican Party\u2019s its main symbol.However such attacks on political campaign branding are not isolated  incidents of the past. We witness Republican  logo design goof ups today as well. [PAR] Discussion and Meaning of these Symbols [PAR] The Democratic donkey represents hard work, diligence, humbleness and a dedication to the USA. The Republicans however, strongly disagree and consider the donkey a symbol of stubbornness. [PAR] On the other hand, the Republican elephant represents intelligence, dignity and is considered as the symbol of strength (as it is seen as the only animal that stood up to a lion). In contrast to this, the Democrats see the elephant as comparable to a circus animal. [PAR] Both of these symbols found firm foundation in the growing American pop culture and were copyrighted to represent the two political parties. The political logos have the prominent standardized colors and stars of the American flag. Generally, the Republican elephant logo upholds 3 stars while the Democratic donkey logo design has 4. However, the donkey can also been seen with a variation of 3 stars. [PAR] The Man Behind the Logo Designs [PAR] Thomas Nast was a political cartoonist, who usually drew satirical cartoons depicting the state of American politics. It was his idea to use the two animals for representing the Democratic and Republican parties. Thomas Nast was born in 1840 and had a great career being a caricaturist, an illustrator and a painter. Apart from the political symbols, he is also well acclaimed for the sketch of fat and jolly Santa Claus carrying gifts for little children (previously, Santa was depicted as skinny). Although the artist died in 1902, his sketches and drawings still live on. [PAR] There you go! Wasn\u2019t that an interesting history?

Importantly for the question topic, the text notes the use of stars and color schemes in the logos, specifically that the Republican elephant logo typically features three stars while the Democratic donkey logo usually has four stars, sometimes varying to three. The logos also incorporate the colors and stars of the American flag, reinforcing national identity.\n\nCentral ideas relevant to the question include the symbolic meanings attributed to the animals, the historical genesis of the logos, and how the design elements (stars, colors) serve to connect party branding with broader American patriotic imagery. The difference in the number of stars (3 vs. 4) and their integration with the red, white, and blue color schemes reflect intentional design choices that reinforce political identity while invoking national symbolism.\n\nSubtle implications include how these design elements contribute to public perception, party differentiation, and the embedding of political identity within the national narrative. The logos thus function both as political markers and as visual affirmations of American values and heritage.\n\nThe difficulty level is rated 9 because the question requires synthesis of historical, symbolic, and design aspects and understanding how these combine to reinforce complex notions of national identity and party branding.

[PAR] They are the elements Fluorine, ( atomic number 9 ),\u00a0 Chlorine, ( atomic number 17 ), Bromine ( atomic number 35 ), Iodine ( atomic number 53 ), Astatine\u00a0 ( atomic number 85 ), and a newly discovered element not yet given a name, that has an atomic number of 117, ( Discovered in 2010). [PAR] However both Astatine and Element No. 117 are too radioactive to be made in quantities that can be weighed. They are man made elements that have very short half lives;\u00a0 so decay into other elements before one has the chance to make any of their compounds. So in most laboratories Halogen chemistry is essentially about the study of Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine & Iodine. [PAR] The word Halogen was coined in 1842 by the Swedish Chemist Berzelius ( 1779 - 1848 ). It is a made up Swedish word which literally means \"Salt producer\" in Swedish. A name in keeping with the reactive nature of these elements. Lots of Halogen salts are known. Eg. Sodium chloride. Potassium fluoride. Sodium Bromide.

[PAR] Fluorine [PAR] As mentioned previously fluorine has an atomic number of 9. This means that an atom of fluorine will have in addition to 9 protons in the nucleus of its atom, it will have a total of 9 electrons orbiting its nucleus. An individual\u00a0 proton always has a charge of +1 and an individual electron always has a charge of -1. [PAR] We have 9 protons in an atom of fluorine each having a charge of +1, plus 9 electrons in that same atom orbiting the nucleus of that atom. [PAR] ( +1 X 9 ) + (-1 X 9 ) = 0. [PAR] \u00a0So the atom is electrically neutral. [PAR] This is true for all neutral atoms of fluorine.

The halogens make up Group VIIA of the Periodic Table of the elements. Elemental halogens are diatomic molecules. However, due to their high reactivity, the halogens are never found in nature in native form. The family name means \"salt-forming,\" from the Greek for salt, \"hals\", and for generating \"genes\". The salinity of the oceans on Earth is due in large part to such halogen salts (halides) as sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium iodide (KI). [PAR] Halogens display physical and chemical properties typical of nonmetals. They have relatively low melting and boiling points that increase steadily down the group. Near room temperature, the halogens span all of the physical states: Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. All of the elements are colored, with the color becoming more intense moving down the group. Fluorine gas is pale yellow, and chlorine gas is a yellowish green.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed overview of the halogen group elements in the periodic table, focusing on their identity, chemical behavior, and the etymology of the term \"halogen.\" It notes that halogens belong to Group 17 (formerly Group VII), comprising fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine, and a synthetic element 117. The key historical insight is that the term \"halogen,\" coined by Berzelius in 1842, means \"salt producer\" in Swedish, reflecting these elements' propensity to form salts, such as sodium chloride and potassium fluoride.

[PAR] Share this: [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] Author [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] URL [PAR] Google [PAR] August 15, 1914, marks the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Panama Canal, the American-built waterway across the Isthmus of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice. [PAR] In 1902, Congress authorized the purchase of the French assets. However, the following year, when Colombia, which Panama was then a",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed historical account of the French attempt to build the Panama Canal in the late 19th century, focusing on the political and legal scandal involving fraud and mismanagement charges against the company executives. Central ideas include the ambitious but flawed engineering plan by Ferdinand de Lesseps to build a sea-level canal like the Suez, the appointment of Gustave Eiffel to design locks, the immense human and financial costs, and the ultimate bankruptcy and scandal that ensued. The scandal resulted in criminal indictments and convictions for fraud and mismanagement, severely impacting the project's progress and reputation. The context also touches on the broader geopolitical implications, such as American interest shifting from Nicaragua to Panama partly due to lobbying by a French engineer.\n\nImplicit in the text is the relationship between technical challenges (disease, engineering difficulties) and managerial failures (fraud, mismanagement), underscoring how corruption and poor leadership compounded the natural obstacles. The scandal's legal outcomes\u2014convictions overturned, retirement of key figures\u2014reflect the complexity of accountability in large infrastructure failures. The political fallout essentially ended the French effort, paving the way for American involvement.\n\nThe question difficulty is rated 9/10, as it demands understanding of historical, technical, legal, and political dimensions of the scandal and its impact on the canal project. The question should probe the intricate interplay of engineering ambition, corruption, and geopolitical outcomes, encouraging domain experts to synthesize these aspects.\n\nA purposeful question could ask about how the fraud and mismanagement scandal influenced subsequent canal development strategies or project outcomes, requiring reflection on broader implications rather than mere factual recall. The question should challenge experts to connect the scandal\u2019s effects to the eventual American takeover and engineering approach changes.\n\nThe context is meaningful, coherent, and rich in educational content on the topic specified.

[PAR] In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.  [PAR] Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066\u20131154,  Plantagenet 1154\u20131485,  Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of  1649\u20131660). [PAR] Dynastically, all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional, beginning with Henry II (reigned 1154-1189) as from that time, the Angevin kings became \"more English in nature\"; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I  of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor. [PAR] The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558\u20131603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World. [PAR] From the accession of James I in 1603, the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the  execution of Charles I in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War  established  the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament, although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. [PAR] From this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom, with the reservation that it is \"uncodified\", is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689. On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.

They called their land Engla land, meaning \"land of the English\",  [PAR] by \u00c6thelweard Latinized Anglia, from an original Anglia vetus, the purported homeland of the Angles (called Angulus by Bede).  The name Engla land became England by haplology during the Middle English period (Engle-land, Engelond).  The Latin name was Anglia or Anglorum terra, the Old French and Anglo-Norman one Angleterre.

Pastorino, Commercial Attach\u00e9, 1974-77 [PAR] On April 25, 1974, Portugal experienced a coup like no other. In an era characterized by the clash of ideologies and power players, the nearly bloodless revolution became known as the Carnation Revolution. What began as a military revolution led by the Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas (MAF) quickly became a mass movement of civil unrest. [PAR] Dictator Marcello Caetano resisted the independence of Portuguese colonies for as long as possible, forcing soldiers to take de-colonization efforts into their own hands. Much of the planning for the revolution took place outside the country, in places like Angola, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique. The Carnation Revolution led to tensions in Portuguese-U.S. relations as the American government believed a Communist victory was imminent. The revolution ended in the peaceful overthrow of Caetano and the Estado Novo or the Second Republic, which had been the installed in 1933 and was the longest surviving regime in Western Europe. [PAR] The Carnation Revolution introduced a new Constitution, the end of Portuguese colonialism, as well as civil liberties which had previously been banned under Caetano's government.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the Carnation Revolution of Portugal on April 25, 1974, a nearly bloodless military coup led by a group of officers opposing the ruling Estado Novo regime. The revolution was initially a military action but rapidly gained widespread civilian support, resulting in the peaceful overthrow of the dictatorship of Marcello Caetano. The officers, part of the Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas (MFA), were motivated by dissatisfaction with the regime\u2019s resistance to decolonization, forcing soldiers to act independently. The revolution culminated in the introduction of a new constitution, the end of Portuguese colonialism, and the granting of civil liberties that had previously been suppressed. Additionally, the revolution had broader geopolitical implications, such as tensions with the U.S., which feared a Communist takeover. The text highlights the interplay between military dissent (MFA officers opposing the junta and colonial policies) and the resulting political ideology shift (from authoritarian dictatorship to democratic freedoms and decolonization). The revolution's success was due in part to the military\u2019s ideological stance against colonialism and dictatorship, combined with popular civilian support, making it a unique European political transformation.\n\nImplicit in the text is the nuanced relationship between military actors who were not mere power seekers but ideologically motivated reformers, influencing the revolution\u2019s goals toward democracy and decolonization rather than outright military rule or Communist dictatorship.

This rash of gang violence reached its bloody climax in a garage on the city\u2019s North Side on February 14, 1929, when seven men associated with the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, one of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, were shot to death by several men dressed as policemen. The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time. No one was ever brought to trial for the murders. [PAR] The Downfall of Public Enemy No. 1 [PAR] Though the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre marked the end of any significant gang opposition to Capone\u2019s rule in Chicago, it can also be said to have marked the beginning of his downfall. With his highly effective organization, his impressive income and his willingness to ruthlessly eliminate his rivals, Capone had become the country\u2019s most notorious gangster, and the newspapers dubbed him \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1.\u201d Federal authorities began investigating Capone after",

[PAR] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390). [PAR] Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the series has broadcast  episodes. It will begin airing its 28th season in September 2016.

[PAR] The Simpsons has received widespread critical acclaim, especially for the \"Golden Age\" of approximately its first ten seasons. Time magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,  and The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\".   On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.

They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.  The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\".  Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.

According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Star of the week: Deneb, distant and very luminous ...Deneb is distant and very luminous | Brightest Stars | EarthSky [PAR] Deneb is distant and very luminous [PAR] By Larry Sessions in Brightest Stars | August 18, 2016 [PAR] Deneb is one of the most distant stars you will see with your eye alone.  That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. [PAR] Image via Fred Espenak [PAR] Deneb is one of the most distant stars you will see with your eye alone. That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The exact distance to Deneb is unclear, with estimates ranging from about 1,425 light-years to perhaps as much as 7,000 light-years. Whatever its exact distance, when you gaze at Deneb, know that you are gazing across thousands of light-years of space. [PAR] The best estimates for Deneb\u2019s distance likely are those obtained by the Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission in the 1990s. A simple calculation from initial Hipparcos data gives the figure of 3,230 light-years, whereas the refined data yield just over 1,400 light-years. At any of these estimates distances, Deneb is one of the farthest stars the unaided human eye can see. It is so far, that the light that reaches the Earth today started on its journey well more than 1,000 years ago. [PAR] Deneb (bottom half of frame) is 200 times bigger than the sun. Image via AstroBob [PAR] In order for us to see it at its enormous distance, Deneb must also be tremendously bright and energetic. Among the 20 brightest stars, only Rigel in Orion surpasses Deneb in intrinsic brightness. Deneb is an A2Ia star, which says that it is white hot (A2) and a supergiant star (Ia). Prof. James Kaler, using the figure of 2,600 light years as the distance, estimated a diameter 200 times greater than our sun, and about a quarter of a million times brighter in visible light. Considering its spectral classification (A2), Deneb must have a surface temperature between about 8500 to 9000 kelvins (roughly 14,800 to 15,700 degrees F). [PAR] This is the famous Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, which shows the luminosities of stars.  See Deneb at the top of the diagram?  It is one of the most luminous stars known. [PAR] Deneb is not the biggest star in the Milky Way. Betelgeuse and Antares , among others, are larger. But Deneb may well be the most energetic (based on the amount of electromagnetic radiation it produces) of the A-type stars. The famed North American nebula, a large cloud of glowing gas in the shape of the continent, likely is glowing in a process similar to fluorescence, energized by the radiation of Deneb. [PAR] Stellar luminosity: The true brightnesses of stars [PAR] How to see it [PAR] White Deneb is the 20th brightest star in the sky. It is one of the most remote stars visible to the eye alone. You can gaze at this faraway star starting in late spring, when Deneb rises over the northeastern horizon by mid-evening. A month later, Deneb is already in the sky by the time it gets dark. In standard time, the midnight culmination date is about August 1. Using Daylight Time, the midnight culmination is about August 15. The word \u2018culmination\u2019 indicates the star\u2019s highest point in the sky. [PAR] Deneb is part of several famous star patterns, which overlap each other. It\u2019s the brightest of the stars composing the constellation Cygnus the Swan, where it marks the Swan\u2019s Tail. When you hear \u2018deneb\u2019 in a star name, it always means \u2018tail.\u2019 Simultaneously, Deneb marks the head of an asterism (a readily recognizable grouping of stars that is not an official constellation), known as the Northern Cross. Plus it is one of the three stars known as the Summer Triangle . The other two stars are Vega and Altair . Deneb is the northernmost and dimmest of the three Triangle stars, but its association with the other bright stars makes it easy to identify. [PAR] Deneb is circumpolar as seen from locations of",
    "topic": "Explore the relationship between apparent brightness, intrinsic luminosity, and distance as exemplified by Deneb\u2019s visibility despite its extreme remoteness.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context centers on the star Deneb, emphasizing its extreme distance from Earth combined with its extraordinary intrinsic luminosity. Key themes include the relationship between apparent brightness and intrinsic luminosity moderated by distance, the challenges of distance estimation (ranging roughly from 1,400 to over 3,000 light-years), and how despite its remoteness, Deneb remains visible to the naked eye due to its immense energy output. The text also touches on spectral classification (A2Ia), size (about 200 times solar diameter), and temperature (8,500\u20139,000 K), highlighting Deneb\u2019s position near the top of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for luminosity. The nuances include how intrinsic luminosity compensates for distance in determining apparent brightness and how Deneb\u2019s visibility offers a practical example of the inverse-square law of light brightness and the challenges in precise astrophysical measurement.\n\nImplicit assumptions include understanding stellar classification, luminosity-distance relationships, and observational astronomy principles. The context also invites reflection on how distance uncertainties affect brightness calculations and the physical interpretation of observational data.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10, given the question must probe the integration of intrinsic luminosity, distance, and apparent brightness, challenging experts to apply astrophysical concepts and measurement uncertainties.\n\nThe question should encourage experts to analyze how Deneb\u2019s exceptional intrinsic luminosity enables its visibility despite vast distance, critically evaluate the interplay of these factors, and reflect on the implications for observational astronomy and stellar physics.\n\nThe question will be conceptual and analytical, focusing on the nuanced relationship between intrinsic luminosity, distance, and apparent brightness, using Deneb as a case study.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Considering Deneb\u2019s extreme distance from Earth and its classification as an A2Ia supergiant with an intrinsic luminosity roughly a quarter of a million times that of the Sun, how does Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness at Earth illustrate the quantitative relationship between a star\u2019s intrinsic luminosity, distance, and observed brightness, and what fundamental astrophysical principle explains why Deneb remains visible to the naked eye despite being thousands of light-years away?\n\nA: Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness is directly proportional to its intrinsic luminosity and inversely proportional to its distance, illustrating the Doppler effect which allows distant luminous stars to appear bright.\n\nB: Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness decreases with the square of its distance but remains observable because its intrinsic luminosity is extremely high, demonstrating the inverse-square law of light propagation.\n\nC: Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness remains constant regardless of distance due to gravitational lensing, which magnifies the light of distant supergiant stars.\n\nD: Deneb\u2019s apparent brightness is primarily determined by its surface temperature rather than its distance or intrinsic luminosity, consistent with Wien\u2019s displacement law.\n\nExplanation: The apparent brightness of a star observed from Earth depends on its intrinsic luminosity divided by the square of its distance, as described by the inverse-square law of light propagation.
