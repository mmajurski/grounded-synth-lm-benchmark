    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context is a comprehensive and detailed reference list from a scholarly review related to robotic and prosthetic hands, including aspects of design, control, sensory feedback, neuroprosthetics, and functional assessment. Although the context itself is a bibliography rather than a narrative text, it reveals key thematic clusters and foundational works that focus on the evolution of prosthetic and robotic hand technology, with particular attention to the trade-offs between mechanical simplicity, dexterity, and robustness. There are references to underactuated designs (e.g., Bicchi 2000), soft robotics (e.g., Trivedi et al. 2008), sensory feedback integration (e.g., Raspopovic et al. 2014), and the challenges in control methodologies including myoelectric and neural interface approaches.\n\nKey nuanced themes include: \n- The difficulty of achieving high dexterity while maintaining mechanical simplicity and robustness in hand design (Bicchi 2000).\n- The concept of morphological computation where the hand's physical design offloads computational control complexity (Pfeifer & Gomez 2009).\n- The development of underactuated mechanisms to balance actuation complexity and functional grasping capabilities.\n- Advances in sensory feedback to restore embodiment and improve control (e.g., intraneural stimulation).\n- The integration of soft robotics to enhance compliance and robustness.\n- The trade-offs between anthropomorphism, weight, complexity, and user needs.\n\nImplicit assumptions and underlying theories revolve around the idea that mechanical design can either simplify or complicate control strategies, and that a balance is required for practical prosthetic usability. The references imply that purely dexterous hands tend to be complex and fragile, whereas simpler hands may lack necessary grasping versatility.\n\nThe difficulty rating for this question is high (9/10), due to the interdisciplinary integration of robotics, biomechanics, neuroengineering, and control theory. A question probing the fundamental design trade-offs and principles that govern robotic/prosthetic hand development, specifically addressing mechanical simplicity versus dexterity and robustness, would challenge experts to synthesize knowledge across these domains.\n\nThe question should stimulate critical reflection on how design choices impact functional outcomes, control complexity, and user acceptance, requiring detailed understanding of both mechanical and neuroprosthetic aspects.\n\nTherefore, a highly challenging question could focus on the implications of underactuation and morphological computation principles in achieving a balance between dexterity and robustness, referencing the core tensions documented in the literature.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of robotic and prosthetic hand design, how does the principle of morphological computation facilitate achieving mechanical simplicity while maintaining a degree of dexterity and robustness, and why is this balance particularly challenging to realize in multifunctional prostheses?\n\nA: Morphological computation offloads control complexity to the hand's physical structure, enabling underactuation that simplifies mechanics but inherently limits dexterity, making it difficult to replicate human-like multifunctionality while ensuring robustness.\n\nB: Morphological computation increases the number of actuators to maximize dexterity, which complicates mechanical design but enhances robustness through redundancy, thus challenging simplicity.\n\nC: Morphological computation relies exclusively on advanced neural control algorithms to compensate for mechanical simplicity, allowing high dexterity without affecting robustness in prosthetic hands.\n\nD: Morphological computation prioritizes cosmetic appearance over functional capability, simplifying mechanical design but reducing both dexterity and robustness, which is why multifunctional prostheses often sacrifice usability.\n\nExplanation: Morphological computation is the concept where the physical design of the hand (e.g., compliant, underactuated mechanisms) inherently performs part of the control task, reducing the number of actuators and simplifying control. This enables mechanical simplicity and robustness by reducing complexity and improving adaptability to object shapes. However, this simplification often restricts the range of achievable movements and fine dexterity, posing a challenge in designing multifunctional prostheses that mimic human hand versatility while remaining reliable and easy to use.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

    "context": "## 4.2. Shared Control to Help Motor Decoding\nThe ultimate goal of RPH control is to be as close as possible to controlling a natural hand. Therefore, an ideal control needs to be intuitive and continuous over individual fingers and wrist movements. Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder. Since reliability is one of the main factors for upper-limb prosthesis users (102), this is a significant issue for the commercialization of more dexterous control schemes.\n\nOne possible solution to improve decoding robustness is to add robotic automation of some portion of the motor command. Shared-control strategies between a subject and a smart robotic hand have been reported for automated preshaping and grasping (103), grip force adjustment\n\n(104), slip detection, and hand closing (105). In the context of single-finger proportional control, Zhuang et al. (79) proposed a shared-control strategy to increase grasp robustness (avoiding accidental drops), by maximizing the number of contacts between the RPH and an object while allowing the user to maintain full autonomy over decisions about grasping and releasing, grasp preshaping, and non-grasp-related motions. These strategies allow both freedom during singlefinger control and robustness during a grasp event (79) and can perform more dexterous movements that cannot be decoded based on EMG alone. However, they necessitate many DOAs (e.g., active control of each phalanx to reposition the fingers around an object), which is still a significant challenge in terms of motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the challenges of implementing shared-control strategies for robotic prosthetic hands (RPH) to achieve natural, dexterous control. It highlights the trade-off between increasing degrees of freedom (DOFs) for better dexterity and the resulting decrease in decoder robustness, which impacts reliability\u2014a critical factor for users. Shared control, where the robotic hand automates some motor commands, can improve robustness and allow dexterous functions beyond EMG decoding alone. However, achieving the necessary many degrees of actuation (DOAs) for fine finger repositioning remains a major obstacle due to difficulties in miniaturizing actuators, managing power consumption, and controlling costs. The core idea is that while shared control enhances function and robustness, the hardware demands of many DOAs create significant practical challenges for prosthetic design and commercialization.\n\nThe question will probe a deep understanding of these trade-offs and the implications of requiring many DOAs in shared-control prostheses. It will require synthesis of the relationship between DOAs, control robustness, and hardware constraints, testing expertise in prosthetic design challenges and shared control strategies.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. The question requires nuanced understanding of advanced prosthesis control concepts, hardware limitations, and the balance between dexterity and reliability.\n\nThe question will ask about the primary practical challenges introduced by the need for many DOAs in shared-control prostheses, focusing on why these challenges matter and their impact on prosthetic design and commercialization.\n\nThis will encourage reflection on the technical and engineering complexities underlying the clinical and user-level benefits of shared control.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of implementing shared-control strategies for robotic prosthetic hands that require many degrees of actuation (DOAs), which of the following best explains why increasing the number of DOAs poses significant challenges for prosthesis design and commercialization?\n\nA: Because many DOAs increase the complexity of EMG signal decoding, reducing the intuitiveness of user control.\n\nB: Because achieving many DOAs demands advanced miniaturization of actuators, increases power consumption, and raises production costs, complicating hardware integration and market viability.\n\nC: Because many DOAs limit the range of motion of individual fingers, thereby reducing the overall dexterity of the prosthetic hand.\n\nD: Because increasing DOAs primarily affects software algorithms, causing delays in shared-control response times and decreasing control robustness.\n\nExplanation: The main challenges of many DOAs stem from the hardware side\u2014miniaturizing actuators to fit in a prosthetic hand, managing the higher power consumption required by multiple actuators, and controlling the increased cost\u2014making hardware integration and commercialization difficult.

    "context": "## 5. RESTORING SENSORY FEEDBACK\nSensory information plays a critical role in both the exploration of the external environment and in any manipulation task. When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface. Prec vious sections have described the different available interfaces; here, we present the encoding techniques and sensors relevant to the design of modern hand prostheses ( Table 1 ).\n\nSensors mounted on a robotic hand should ideally record the whole spectrum of available human sensations, from both external and internal sources. Indeed, sensory information from the human hand covers both interactions with the external world (tactile perception, thermal perception, and nociception, i.e., perception of pain) and internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles, together known as proprioception. Table 2 shows examples of sensor placements on RPHs from recent studies.\n",
    "topic": "Comparative analysis of different interface technologies used to deliver sensory feedback from prosthetic sensors to the human nervous system.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context focuses on the critical role of sensory feedback in prosthetic hands, emphasizing the restoration of afferent sensory channels for dexterous manipulation and embodiment. It highlights the three essential components of a sensory feedback system: sensor readings, encoding strategies, and interfaces. The text also notes the importance of capturing a broad spectrum of human sensations\u2014external (tactile, thermal, nociception) and internal (proprioception)\u2014to replicate natural sensory experience in prosthetic devices. While the text mentions the existence of various interface technologies and encoding methods, it does not elaborate on specific interface types or their comparative advantages and limitations.\n\nThe central theme revolves around the integration of sensor data and the delivery of this information to the nervous system through appropriate encoding and interface strategies, which is a complex multidisciplinary challenge involving neuroengineering, sensor technology, and neural interfacing.\n\nImplicitly, the text assumes that the interface technology must effectively translate sensor data into a format interpretable by the nervous system to achieve embodiment and functional dexterity. The mention of proprioception and nociception hints at the necessity for interfaces that can deliver multimodal sensory feedback, not just tactile signals.\n\nGiven the technical nature of prosthetic sensory restoration, a challenging question could involve analyzing the impact of different interface types on the fidelity of sensory feedback and the resulting functional outcomes, requiring an understanding of neural coding, interface invasiveness, and sensory modality integration.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 due to the need for comprehensive knowledge in neuroprosthetics, neural interfaces, and sensory encoding.\n\nThe question will thus probe the comparative implications of interface technologies in delivering sensory feedback, particularly how they affect the restoration of multiple sensory modalities and the embodiment of prosthetic devices.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of restoring sensory feedback in prosthetic hands, how do invasive neural interfaces compare to non-invasive interfaces in terms of enabling multimodal sensory feedback (tactile, thermal, nociceptive, and proprioceptive) and promoting prosthetic embodiment?\n\nA: Invasive neural interfaces generally provide higher-fidelity, multimodal sensory feedback and stronger embodiment due to direct neural activation, whereas non-invasive interfaces are limited in modality and less effective in promoting embodiment.\n\nB: Non-invasive interfaces surpass invasive ones by offering more precise and comprehensive multimodal sensory feedback without surgical risks, thus enhancing embodiment more effectively.\n\nC: Both invasive and non-invasive interfaces provide equivalent multimodal sensory feedback and embodiment since encoding strategies fully compensate for interface limitations.\n\nD: Invasive interfaces provide high-fidelity tactile feedback but cannot deliver proprioceptive or nociceptive sensations, while non-invasive interfaces are better suited for these modalities.\n\nExplanation: Invasive neural interfaces directly stimulate peripheral or central nervous system structures, enabling precise and multimodal sensory feedback (including proprioception and nociception) that closely mimics natural afferent signals, which is critical for prosthetic embodiment and dexterous control. Non-invasive interfaces, such as vibrotactile or electrotactile stimulation on the skin, tend to provide limited sensory modalities and lower fidelity, resulting in reduced embodiment and functional integration.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

    "context": "## 2.1. Existing Robotic Prosthetic Hands\nNumerous commercially available RPH solutions use underactuated mechanisms ( Supplemental Table 1 ), including the Michelangelo prosthetic hand (Ottobock, Germany), the i-Limb Ultra (\u00d6ssur, Iceland), the bebionic hand (Ottobock), and the VINCENT evolution 3 (Vincent Systems, Germany). Despite remarkable advances, there is still arguably a trade-off between dexterity and weight in these solutions, with companies usually emphasizing one aspect or the other.\n\nMany research groups are currently working on innovative solutions to tackle the dexterity/ weight dilemma (19), such as the use of a monolithic 3D-printed soft material (20) or mechanical solutions to implement finger synergies via clutches (21). For example, Jing et al. (19) proposed an anthropomorphic RPH using only three motors that could achieve 13 grasp types while weighing only approximately 130 g.\n\nThe price of RPHs is an additional limiting factor for broader adoption by patients. With most advanced solutions costing $10,000-20,000, many researchers advocate for cheaper solutions, particularly for emerging countries (e.g., 22).\n\nOpen source RPHs are an exciting alternative to dramatically reduce the cost of development and distribution. One particularly interesting aspect of such hands is simplified maintenance and repairs (using, e.g., 3D printing) that do not rely on specific suppliers. For example, Open\n\nBionics (United Kingdom) commercializes solutions for transradial amputees (e.g., the medically certified Hero Arm) but also provides the source files for some of their designs, and e-NABLE ( https://enablingthefuture.org ) reports 8,000 recipients of their prosthetics, which were built by volunteers around the world. Open source RPHs also enable users to alter the design to meet their unique needs; for example, the Galileo Hand (23) allows easy customization of the types of movements and number of electromyography (EMG) electrodes.\n\nResearchers are also working on better mechanical solutions to improve RPH dexterity. An underactuated hand prosthesis designed by Abayasiri et al. (24) has finger abduction and adduction to enable it to grasp larger objects, and an adaptive prosthetic hand designed by Yong et al. (25) adds DOFs in the palm with movable metacarpals. The Karlsruhe Institute of T echnology (KIT) prosthetic hand (26) has an embedded camera and real-time object recognition, enabling the hand to be preshaped. Pneumatic artificial muscle (27) permits the development of light, compact solutions. Finally, biomimetic actuation is used for muscle-like actuators (15).\n\nIn addition to the hardware aspect, there are also innovations in RPH control and sensorization. Low-level controllers use information about the state of the device and eventually activate the actuation to meet the desired state imposed by the user's intentions. The choice of the state variable has a strong influence on how the device works. Position or speed can be read through encoders of each joint and controlled; these are straightforward approaches that have been used broadly in robotic applications. When the interaction of the hand with the external environment is of interest, more advanced control systems are implemented, such as torque or impedance control. Both approaches measure the force applied by the actuator, controlling it directly in the first case and simulating compliance in the second. Advanced control strategies enable complex manipulation and smoother gestures at the expense of a bulkier mechanical structure and a more complex control system. Therefore, enabling more sophisticated control requires integrated force and position sensors, which have been previously developed mainly to close the robotic control loop (28).\n\nIn summary, low-cost and light hands have flourished over the last few years. The race to simplify designs and reduce costs through 3D printing should not impact the dexterity of RPHs. For now, underactuated mechanisms are the best solution for RPHs and innovative designs based on synergy mechanisms or friction, the latter of which can help increase the number of DOAs without increasing the number of motors.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses various aspects of robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs), focusing on design trade-offs, innovations in mechanical structure, control strategies, sensorization, and cost considerations. Central to the discussion is the role of sensors, particularly integrated force and position sensors, in enabling advanced control methods such as torque and impedance control. These sensors are critical for closing the control loop, allowing the prosthetic hand to interact adaptively and smoothly with its environment.\n\nThe nuanced theme involves the balance between mechanical complexity and control sophistication: while simple position or speed control using encoders is straightforward, it limits interaction capabilities. Incorporating force sensing allows for more advanced control strategies that simulate compliance and enable complex manipulation. This integration, however, comes at the cost of increased mechanical bulk and control system complexity.\n\nImplicitly, the text assumes that integrated sensing is foundational for enhancing dexterity beyond basic grasping, enabling prosthetic hands to perform nuanced, adaptive manipulation. The challenges include maintaining light weight and low cost while embedding such sensors and control systems. The potential applications extend to more natural, human-like prosthetic behaviors.\n\nThe difficulty level is high (around 8/10) because the question requires understanding robotics control theory, sensor integration, and their implications for prosthetic hand functionality. The question should provoke reflection on why integrated sensing is pivotal, how it contrasts with simpler control, and what trade-offs arise.\n\nThe planned question will probe the expert\u2019s comprehension of the functional role and implications of integrating both force and position sensors in robotic prosthetic hands, specifically how they enable advanced control and manipulation capabilities, reflecting a sophisticated grasp of prosthetic control systems and sensor technology.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do integrated force and position sensors fundamentally enable advanced control strategies in robotic prosthetic hands, and what are the main trade-offs involved in their implementation compared to simpler position-only control systems?\n\nA: They allow for direct measurement and control of joint torques, enabling torque or impedance control which facilitates adaptive and compliant interaction with objects, but this increases mechanical complexity and control system bulk.\n\nB: They primarily reduce the weight of the prosthetic hand by eliminating the need for multiple motors, thus simplifying the mechanical design without affecting control complexity.\n\nC: They replace the need for electromyography (EMG) signals by directly reading muscle activity, thereby simplifying user intention decoding but increasing sensor calibration demands.\n\nD: They enable the prosthetic hand to operate entirely autonomously without any user input by preprogramming force and position trajectories, which reduces the need for active control.\n\nExplanation: Integrated force and position sensors provide the necessary feedback to implement advanced control strategies such as torque and impedance control, allowing the hand to adaptively interact with its environment and perform smoother, more complex gestures.

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n",

This reduces complexity, weight, and cost.\n\nThe passage implicitly assumes knowledge of biomechanics, actuation, degrees of freedom, and morphological computation.

    "context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n",

    "context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed taxonomy and critical evaluation of electrode interfaces used for peripheral nerve interfacing, emphasizing their classification by invasiveness: surface electrodes, extraneural, intraneural, and regenerative approaches. It highlights the trade-offs between invasiveness and selectivity, nuances in motor versus sensory domains, and additional factors influencing interface performance such as spatial reach, geometry, material, signal quality, and stability. The context also discusses practical considerations like surgical ease and cost, and compares different electrode types in terms of their capacity for motor decoding and sensory feedback, noting the current limitations and advancements. The text presents complex and nuanced insights into how electrode design impacts neural interfacing outcomes, making it suitable for generating a highly challenging question that probes deep understanding of these relationships, the implications of electrode configurations, and the balance of competing design criteria.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 due to the integration of multidimensional criteria (selectivity, invasiveness, geometry, signal stability) and implications for practical application in both motor and sensory domains.\n\nThe question should challenge experts to synthesize these themes, for instance by asking about the nuanced trade-offs and how specific electrode configurations influence both spatial reach and selectivity beyond simple invasiveness considerations, reflecting recent findings that question classical assumptions.

    "context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n",

It covers the types of electrodes (noninvasive tactors, cuff electrodes, TIMEs, Utah arrays), the trade-offs between noninvasive and invasive approaches, and the challenges in achieving natural, intuitive sensations. The text highlights that simple proportional modulation of stimulation parameters is common but has limitations in naturalness and informativeness. Advanced biomimetic or neuromorphic stimulation patterns that simulate biological firing patterns show improved sensation naturalness, intuitiveness, and functional dexterity.

    "context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n",

    "context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context addresses various assessment tools for evaluating prosthetic hand function, with particular emphasis on sensory feedback integration and its effects on rehabilitation outcomes. Key ideas include the diverse methodologies for measuring grasping ability, force control, object discrimination, cognitive load during tasks, and embodiment of prosthetics. The text highlights the complex, multifactorial etiology of phantom limb pain (PLP), involving nociceptive, neuropathic, and psychogenic mechanisms, and notes that prosthetics with sensory feedback have been shown to significantly reduce PLP. It also discusses how prolonged prosthetic use with sensory feedback influences body schema, embodiment, and peripersonal space. The context stresses the absence of a single, comprehensive measurement tool for prosthetic use and the ongoing efforts to develop validated tools, especially for sensory feedback-enabled prostheses.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that sensory feedback can modulate cortical plasticity and pain perception, that embodiment and body schema representation are plastic and influenced by sensory inputs, and that cognitive load can reflect intuitiveness of prosthetic control. The text suggests underlying theories of neuroplasticity, sensorimotor integration, and multisensory representation of the body and space. Applications involve improving prosthetic design and rehabilitation protocols to reduce PLP and enhance functional integration.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

    "context": "## 7. CONCLUSION\nMorethan20years ago,remarkable results by a group of French surgeons for hand transplantation (8) had raised hopes for a future where grafting would be the norm and prosthetics eventually obsolete (176). However, not only has this prediction-unfortunately-not yet come to pass, but also the adoption of new RPH technologies has been slower than expected. As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback. We have proposed here an outline of possible iterations of RPHs for the next few years and for 5-10 years in the future.\n\nIn our view, there could soon be a broader integration of simple somatosensory feedback using mature implantable techniques, such as cuff electrodes. Motor decoding using machine learning and shared-control algorithms could permit continuous command of single fingers and broader sets of grasps. Ultimately, the next generation of prosthetics could use more advanced soft implantable electrodes, which could enable more sophisticated sensory encoding (proprioception, temperature perception, touch perception, and nociception) and motor decoding using, for example, deep learning techniques. But to reach this goal, the field must tackle significant challenges related to system integration, electronic miniaturization, computational power, surgical procedure, electrode robustness, the robotic hand itself, and the encoding of somatosensory information.\n",

It emphasizes the current state of the art\u2014implantable cuff electrodes for somatosensory feedback and machine learning/shared-control algorithms for motor decoding. It projects that future systems, within 5-10 years, could integrate advanced soft implantable electrodes enabling more sophisticated sensory modalities (proprioception, temperature, touch, nociception) and utilize deep learning techniques for enhanced motor decoding. The passage also underscores significant challenges that must be overcome, including system integration, miniaturization, computational power, surgical techniques, electrode durability, and the complexity of encoding nuanced somatosensory signals.\n\nThe central ideas revolve around the potential transformative impact of deep learning on both motor decoding and sensory feedback encoding in prosthetic hands, promising richer, more natural control and perception. The subtlety lies in understanding how deep learning differs from traditional machine learning approaches in this context, what specific advances in sensory encoding are anticipated, and the multidisciplinary challenges that remain.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

    "topic": "Emerging materials and technologies for soft, flexible, and bioinspired implantable neuroprostheses.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context is an extensive and detailed literature reference list and acknowledgments section from a review article focused on implantable neuroprostheses, particularly covering emerging materials, soft and flexible technologies, bioinspired designs, and control methods for upper limb prosthetics and neuroprosthetic interfaces. The references include seminal and state-of-the-art works on robotic hands, neural interfaces, sensory feedback, EMG signal processing, machine learning for prosthetic control, electrode design, and clinical outcome measures. The depth and breadth of cited works reflect interdisciplinary advances in materials science, neural engineering, robotics, and rehabilitation.\n\nCentral ideas identified include:\n- The critical role of soft, flexible materials and bioinspired mechanisms in improving prosthetic hand dexterity and integration.\n- Advances in neural interfaces (intraneural, cuff, longitudinal, transverse electrodes) enabling bidirectional communication and sensory feedback.\n- Sophisticated myoelectric control strategies leveraging surface and intramuscular EMG, pattern recognition, and deep learning to decode user intent.\n- The importance of sensory feedback (vibrotactile, mechanotactile, intraneural stimulation) in embodiment and functional restoration.\n- Challenges and solutions related to electrode design, signal stability, and cognitive load in prosthetic control.\n- The use of morphological computation and soft robotics principles to reduce control complexity and improve adaptability.\n- Clinical and functional assessments of prosthetic devices, highlighting usability and quality of life.\n\nImplicit assumptions and nuanced themes include:\n- The necessity of integrating neural interfaces with soft and flexible materials to achieve long-term biocompatibility and stable performance.\n- The balance between mechanical complexity and control simplicity via underactuated and synergy-inspired designs.\n- The role of adaptive and transfer learning approaches to enhance robustness against electrode displacement and inter-session variability.\n- The critical impact of providing biomimetic sensory feedback on motor control, perception, and user acceptance.\n- The emerging trend toward fully implanted, self-contained neuromusculoskeletal prostheses for naturalistic function.\n\nThe difficulty of questions based solely on this context rates around 9/10 given the technical and interdisciplinary nature of the references and the need to synthesize across multiple fields (materials science, neuroengineering, robotics, signal processing).\n\nA highly insightful question would engage with the interplay between materials, neural interface technology, and control strategies, probing a deep understanding of how emerging soft, flexible, bioinspired materials impact the design and function of implantable neuroprostheses and their neural interfaces.\n\nThe question should require synthesis of knowledge about material properties, electrode design, signal fidelity, user embodiment, and control complexity.\n\nGiven that the context is a reference list, the question must be constructed to be answerable by a domain expert without direct textual reference but based on their integrated knowledge of the field as represented by these references.\n\nThis approach ensures meaningful engagement and challenges experts to connect materials science innovations with neuroprosthetic functionality.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do the integration of soft, flexible bioinspired materials with advanced neural interfaces enhance the stability and naturalness of sensory feedback in implantable neuroprostheses, and what are the key challenges that must be addressed to maintain long-term functionality in such systems?\nA: By providing mechanical compliance that matches biological tissues, these materials reduce immune response and electrode encapsulation, enhancing signal stability and enabling biomimetic sensory feedback; key challenges include maintaining electrode-tissue interface integrity, minimizing motion artifacts, and ensuring durable material biocompatibility.\nB: Soft, flexible materials primarily improve the mechanical strength of prostheses but have minimal impact on neural interface performance; the main challenge is integrating rigid electrodes without compromising electrical conductivity.\nC: The use of bioinspired materials allows for wireless power transmission, which directly improves sensory feedback quality; the chief challenge is developing energy-efficient stimulation protocols.\nD: Advanced neural interfaces eliminate the need for soft materials by using rigid silicon-based electrodes that provide stable signals; the major challenge is reducing surgical complexity.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer (A) encapsulates how soft, flexible, and bioinspired materials provide mechanical compliance that better matches biological tissues, reducing immune reactions and fibrosis around electrodes, thereby enhancing the stability of neural recordings and stimulation crucial for natural sensory feedback. It also identifies key challenges such as electrode-tissue interface integrity over time, reduction of motion-induced artifacts, and long-term biocompatibility of materials, which are critical for the sustained functionality of implantable neuroprostheses.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context is a complex table summarizing various clinical assessments for transradial amputees using robotic prosthetic hands. The table categorizes assessments based on somatosensory feedback type (implicit, explicit, or both) and measurement types (e.g., handling/manipulation, psychometric, questionnaire). It also shows which assessments measure fine movement, reach, grasp, embodiment, quality of life, and clinical validation status. The table includes references and specific test names, linking the type of feedback with the functional or subjective domain evaluated. The nuanced relationship between somatosensory feedback modalities and the measurement focus (e.g., grasp vs. embodiment) is critical for selecting appropriate assessments. The complexity arises from understanding how implicit and explicit feedback mechanisms correspond to different functional assessments and the clinical relevance of these tests for prosthetic evaluation.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 \u2013 The question must require an expert-level understanding of somatosensory feedback mechanisms, clinical assessment selection, and measurement types in prosthetic rehabilitation.\n\nThe question should probe the expert\u2019s ability to synthesize how somatosensory feedback types influence the choice of clinical assessments and measurement domains, reflecting deep insight into both neurophysiological and clinical evaluation aspects.\n\nThe question will encourage critical reflection on the implications of feedback modality on functional and psychosocial assessment in prosthetic use, requiring nuanced understanding beyond rote knowledge.\n\nThis will test the expert's capability to align the theoretical foundations of somatosensory feedback with practical clinical assessment strategies.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does the distinction between implicit and explicit somatosensory feedback mechanisms influence the selection of clinical assessments for evaluating grasp versus embodiment in transradial amputees using robotic prosthetic hands?\n\nA: Implicit feedback assessments primarily focus on grasp functionality through handling and manipulation tasks, while explicit feedback assessments are more suited for measuring embodiment via psychometric and questionnaire-based methods.\n\nB: Explicit feedback assessments predominantly evaluate grasp through handling and manipulation tasks, whereas implicit feedback assessments mainly assess embodiment using psychometric tests.\n\nC: Both implicit and explicit feedback assessments equally focus on grasp and embodiment without differentiation in clinical measurement type or test selection.\n\nD: Implicit feedback assessments are limited to quality of life questionnaires, while explicit feedback assessments exclusively measure fine movement and grasp through physical tests.\n\nExplanation: The table indicates that clinical assessments linked to implicit somatosensory feedback tend to focus on functional tasks such as pick and place and handling/manipulation of objects, which relate to grasp. In contrast, assessments associated with explicit feedback often use psychometric or questionnaire-based tools to measure embodiment and subjective experience.

    "context": "## 4.2. Shared Control to Help Motor Decoding\nThe ultimate goal of RPH control is to be as close as possible to controlling a natural hand. Therefore, an ideal control needs to be intuitive and continuous over individual fingers and wrist movements. Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder. Since reliability is one of the main factors for upper-limb prosthesis users (102), this is a significant issue for the commercialization of more dexterous control schemes.\n\nOne possible solution to improve decoding robustness is to add robotic automation of some portion of the motor command. Shared-control strategies between a subject and a smart robotic hand have been reported for automated preshaping and grasping (103), grip force adjustment\n\n(104), slip detection, and hand closing (105). In the context of single-finger proportional control, Zhuang et al. (79) proposed a shared-control strategy to increase grasp robustness (avoiding accidental drops), by maximizing the number of contacts between the RPH and an object while allowing the user to maintain full autonomy over decisions about grasping and releasing, grasp preshaping, and non-grasp-related motions. These strategies allow both freedom during singlefinger control and robustness during a grasp event (79) and can perform more dexterous movements that cannot be decoded based on EMG alone. However, they necessitate many DOAs (e.g., active control of each phalanx to reposition the fingers around an object), which is still a significant challenge in terms of motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\n",
    "topic": "Specific applications of shared control in prosthetics, including automated preshaping, grip force adjustment, slip detection, and hand closing.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the challenge of achieving natural, intuitive, and robust control of a robotic prosthetic hand (RPH) with multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) and proportional control. Increasing dexterity by adding DOFs reduces decoder robustness, which is critical for user reliability and commercialization. Shared control is introduced as a strategy that combines user input with robotic automation to improve robustness and functionality. Specifically, shared control can automate preshaping, grip force adjustment, slip detection, and hand closing. The approach allows users to maintain autonomy over grasp decisions and non-grasp movements while the system enhances grasp reliability, such as by maximizing contact points to prevent accidental drops. The strategy can enable dexterous movements not achievable through EMG decoding alone, but it requires many degrees of active articulation (DOAs), which poses challenges in miniaturization, power, and cost.\n\nKey themes and relationships:\n- Trade-off between increased DOFs/dexterity and decoder robustness.\n- Shared control as a hybrid approach combining human motor intent and robotic automation.\n- Specific shared control applications: automated preshaping, grip force adjustment, slip detection, hand closing.\n- Benefits: improved grasp robustness, prevention of accidental drops, maintenance of user autonomy.\n- Challenges: increased DOAs, motor miniaturization, power consumption, cost.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 \u2014 The question must probe understanding of shared control's role in balancing dexterity and robustness, and the technical and practical implications of implementing such systems.\n\nThe question should challenge experts to analyze the rationale and implications of shared control in prosthetics, especially how it addresses limitations of pure motor decoding and what trade-offs it entails.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does implementing shared control strategies in robotic prosthetic hands reconcile the trade-off between increased dexterity through more degrees of freedom and the critical need for decoder robustness, and what are the principal technical challenges that arise from this approach?\nA: Shared control reduces decoder complexity by fully automating all finger movements, eliminating the need for user input, but requires extensive sensor arrays, which increases power consumption and cost.\nB: Shared control combines user motor commands with robotic automation to maintain user autonomy while enhancing grasp robustness through automated preshaping, grip force adjustment, slip detection, and hand closing; however, it demands many active degrees of articulation, posing challenges in motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\nC: Shared control simplifies control by limiting prosthetic movement to a single degree of freedom, thus improving robustness but sacrificing dexterity and requiring minimal power and hardware.\nD: Shared control replaces EMG-based decoding with fully autonomous robotic control to maximize reliability, which removes the need for complex motor miniaturization but reduces the user's ability to perform non-grasp-related motions.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer reflects that shared control improves robustness by combining user intent with automated functions like preshaping and slip detection, preserving autonomy while enabling dexterity beyond EMG decoding alone; the main challenges are implementing many active DOAs requiring miniaturized motors and managing power and cost.\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

While the text itself does not explicitly discuss the methodologies or challenges, the references cited cover critical topics such as myoelectric control, intraneural interfaces, sensory feedback mechanisms, prosthetic hand designs, and the decoding of neural signals for prosthesis control. The numerous citations to works on simultaneous and proportional control, pattern recognition, sensory feedback, and morphological computation indicate a broad and deep coverage of the challenges and approaches to achieving dexterous control of multiple degrees-of-freedom in upper limb prostheses.\n\nThis context, although indirect and bibliographic, implicitly reflects the complexity of integrating multi-DOF control in prosthetics via neural and myoelectric signals, the difficulties in achieving robust, simultaneous, and proportional actuation, and the importance of sensory feedback for embodiment and functional use. The references also touch on advanced computational methods such as deep learning, pattern recognition, and adaptive learning, which are critical in tackling these challenges.\n\nGiven the bibliographic nature, generating a highly technical question requires synthesizing the implications of these works rather than focusing on a single explicit statement. The question should probe understanding of the key challenges and methodologies for simultaneous and proportional control of multi-DOF prostheses, referencing common hurdles such as signal variability, electrode placement, neural decoding complexity, feedback integration, and user adaptation.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 \u2014 The question must require an expert-level integration of knowledge from neural engineering, robotics, signal processing, and prosthetics design fields.\n\nThe question will prompt reflection on the interplay between neural interfaces, signal decoding, and mechanical design to achieve naturalistic control over multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously and proportionally, highlighting the nuanced challenges and state-of-the-art solutions.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What are the principal challenges in achieving simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees-of-freedom in upper limb prostheses, and which methodologies have been most effective in addressing these challenges to enable naturalistic and robust prosthetic hand function?\n\nA: The main challenges include decoding complex, noisy EMG signals and integrating sensory feedback; effective methodologies involve advanced pattern recognition, intraneural interfaces, and closed-loop sensory feedback systems.\n\nB: The principal challenges are primarily mechanical, such as actuator weight and battery life; solutions focus on lightweight materials and energy-efficient motors.\n\nC: The main difficulties lie in user psychological acceptance and cosmetic appearance; successful approaches prioritize realistic aesthetics and user training programs.\n\nD: The major obstacles are software latency and wireless connectivity issues; effective methods include optimizing communication protocols and cloud-based control algorithms.\n\nExplanation: Achieving simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom in upper limb prostheses is chiefly hindered by the complexity and variability of myoelectric and neural signals, the difficulty of stable long-term neural interface implantation, and the lack of natural sensory feedback.

    "context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a comprehensive overview of various psychometric and experimental tools used to assess prosthetic embodiment, body schema changes, and functional performance in users of robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs). It covers classic functional tests (Box and Block Test, Clothespin Relocation Test, Action Research Arm Test), specialized sensory-feedback-related tests (Virtual Egg Test, magnetic table task), and cognitive load assessments during sensorimotor tasks. Importantly, it highlights the use of psychometric paradigms inspired by the rubber hand illusion and visuo-tactile and cross-modal congruency tasks to measure embodiment and body schema changes, along with audio-tactile integration tasks to assess peripersonal space representation changes around the prosthetic limb.

    "context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses critical challenges and future perspectives in motor decoding for robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs), emphasizing the trade-offs between invasive and noninvasive electrode approaches, and importantly, the constraints imposed by power consumption and processing resources within embedded electronics. Central ideas include the limited battery space in prostheses restricting electronics size, which in turn limits processing power and model complexity. The text highlights the cumbersome nature of high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) electronics due to many input channels, necessitating miniaturization and portability. It also underscores the paramount importance of low latency (<300 ms) for seamless control, and the challenge of integrating sufficiently complex decoding models into embedded systems with limited resources. Potential solutions such as offloading computation to smartphones or cloud computing are mentioned to bypass embedded limitations.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that prosthesis size strictly limits battery capacity and thus electronics size and power budget, that increasing electrode count and decoding model complexity improves control but demands more processing power and energy, and that there is a trade-off between miniaturization and computational capability. The text also implies a future where connectivity and external computational resources might mitigate embedded hardware constraints.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

It encourages critical reflection on design implications for real-time control, model sophistication, and user experience, connecting abstract engineering constraints with practical prosthetic functionality.\n\nThis analysis justifies generating a highly challenging conceptual and application-based multiple-choice question that tests the integration of these constraints and their impact on prosthetic system design.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do power consumption constraints in robotic prosthetic hands fundamentally influence the trade-offs between battery size, embedded electronics miniaturization, and processing resource availability, and what is a key implication of these trade-offs for decoding model complexity and real-time control?\n\nA: Power consumption constraints limit battery size, which restricts the physical space for embedded electronics, forcing miniaturization that reduces processing resources; consequently, decoding models must be simplified to meet low-latency real-time control requirements within the limited computational capacity.\n\nB: Power constraints allow for larger batteries in prostheses, enabling more complex embedded electronics and processing resources, which facilitates highly complex decoding models without impacting real-time control latency.\n\nC: Battery size is unrelated to embedded electronics miniaturization, so processing resources can be increased independently, allowing for arbitrarily complex decoding models without affecting real-time control performance.\n\nD: Increasing battery size to overcome power constraints always leads to heavier prostheses, which improves processing resources but significantly increases the latency of decoding models beyond acceptable real-time control thresholds.\n\nExplanation: Power consumption constraints impose strict limits on battery size due to the limited prosthetic volume, which in turn restricts the size and power budget of embedded electronics. This necessitates miniaturization, inherently reducing available processing resources. As a result, decoding models must balance complexity and computational demands to ensure low-latency (<300 ms) real-time control, as overly complex models would exceed the embedded system's capabilities.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context presents a detailed comparative overview of various clinical assessments applied to transradial amputees using robotic prosthetic hands. It categorizes these assessments based on the presence of somatosensory feedback (implicit vs. explicit), the specific motor or cognitive functions measured (fine movement, reach, grasp, embodiment, quality of life), and the nature of the measurement (psychometric, handling/manipulation tasks, questionnaires). It also notes clinical validation status and references. This matrix highlights the complexity of evaluating prosthetic hand functionality not only through physical task performance but also through psychological and quality-of-life metrics.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that somatosensory feedback type (implicit or explicit) significantly influences assessment outcomes and that a diverse set of evaluation tools is necessary to capture the multifaceted impact of prosthetic hands on users. The subtlety lies in differentiating which assessments measure functional motor skills versus perceptual and psychosocial integration (embodiment and quality of life). The table implies that design and customization of prosthetic hands must consider these multidimensional outcomes to truly enhance user functionality and well-being.\n\nThe complexity level is rated at 9/10, as understanding the implications requires integrating knowledge of prosthetic technology, sensorimotor integration, clinical evaluation methods, and patient-centered outcomes.\n\nThe question should provoke reflection on how the variability in assessment types and somatosensory feedback modalities informs the optimization of prosthetic hand design, emphasizing a holistic approach beyond mere mechanical function. It should challenge experts to synthesize these elements and consider how clinical assessment outcomes guide customization strategies that improve both physical performance and psychosocial aspects of prosthesis use.\n\nThis approach ensures the question is not just factual recall but requires deep conceptual insight into clinical evaluation and prosthetic engineering.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do variations in somatosensory feedback modalities (implicit versus explicit) across clinical assessments influence the design priorities for robotic prosthetic hands to optimize both functional performance and user embodiment?\n\nA: Implicit feedback assessments prioritize mechanical precision in hand design, while explicit feedback assessments emphasize enhancing tactile sensation to improve embodiment and quality of life.\n\nB: Explicit feedback assessments focus solely on fine motor skills improvement, whereas implicit feedback assessments address psychosocial factors such as embodiment and quality of life.\n\nC: Both implicit and explicit feedback assessments equally emphasize mechanical grasp strength, thus design should focus primarily on force generation capabilities.\n\nD: Somatosensory feedback modalities do not significantly influence prosthetic hand design since clinical assessments mainly evaluate gross motor function.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer recognizes that implicit feedback assessments often relate to mechanical handling and manipulation tasks focusing on functional performance, while explicit feedback assessments incorporate perceptual and psychosocial dimensions like embodiment and quality of life, thereby guiding design towards enhancing tactile sensation and user integration.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

    "context": "## 5.1. Sensors for Proprioception\nProprioception is not only fundamental for a dexterous hand prosthesis, enabling vision-free manipulation and multitasking, but is also the key to a properly embodied device (64). Usually, kinematic parameters of the robotic hand and (when available) the force exerted are needed to implement low-level control of the actuators, so they are measured with well-established systems, such as rotary encoders or the motor's current draw.\n\n\n## 5.2. Tactile Sensors\nDespite improvements in sensor miniaturization,computational power,and knowledge of the neurophysiology of somatosensation (tactile sensation and proprioception), the capabilities of sensorized RPHs remain far from those of a natural hand. Overcoming this limitation will require satisfying three conditions: The sensors must match the skin's sensing ability, a sufficient number of sensors must be embedded on the surface of the hand, and it must be possible to reliably read information from them. The first condition can be addressed with current technology, as the resolution of existing force and pressure sensors already matches human skin performance (120). However, fulfilling the second and third conditions is another matter, and we need to push the boundaries of circuit integration in order to create an RPH with many sensors and a way to communicate with them.\n\nThe classical solution of using general-purpose sensors developed separately from the signal conditioning circuit and the subsequent signal processing has shown its limit. Instead, efforts are being made to optimize these devices with prosthetics in mind. For example, borrowing the concept of morphological computation from robotics (121), sensors can be optimized for specific tasks by tuning the features of their mechanical structures accordingly. Indeed, exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination (61, 115). Another example comes from Kim et al. (122), who measured forces using sensors embedded in a soft substrate.\n\n)\n\nContinued\n\n(\n\n| Sensor distribution a                       |            |             |             |             |                  |              |                 |              |\n\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n\n| Interface                                   | G10 tactor | TIME        | TENS        | TIME        | FINE             | TIME         | Vibrators       | TENS         |\n\n| Electrical stimulation encoding Pulse width | -          | Fixed       | Linear      | Fixed       | Time variant     | Fixed        | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Amplitude                                   | -          | Linear      | Fixed       | Model based | Fixed            | Fixed        | -               | Fixed        |\n\n| Frequency                                   | -          | Fixed       | Fixed       | Model based | Linear           | Neuromorphic | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Mechanical stimulation encoding             | Linear     | -           | -           | -           | -                | -            | Discrete events | -            |\n\n| RPH model                                   | Passive    | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | SensorHand Speed | IH2 Azzurra  | Various         | bebionic     |\n\n| Reference                                   | 4          | 6           | 60          | 62          | 38               | 61           | 129             | 59           |\n\n| Year                                        | 2011       | 2014        | 2017        | 2018        | 2014             | 2016         | 2016            | 2018         |\n",

    "context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n",

The text highlights the evolving sophistication in stimulation patterns aimed at evoking more natural, intuitive sensations, such as biomimetic and neuromorphic patterns.\n\nA key focal point is the clinical potential of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) as a promising sensory neuroprosthesis approach due to its use of FDA-approved devices and less complex surgical procedures compared to peripheral nerve interfaces.

Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35).

    "context": "## 5.5. Perspectives\nWe believe that sensorization will play a significant role in the next generation of RPHs. Here, we discuss three main directions influenced by sensorization: embedded sensorization, improved stimulation strategies, and new computational architectures.\n\n5.5.1. Embedded sensorization. Sensorized hands are not yet prevalent in the literature but are starting to draw interest, especially with the improvement of interfaces for bidirectional prostheses (for a list of RPHs with sensorized fingertips, see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). As a recent example, Controzzi et al. (141) developed the Mia hand (Prensilia, Italy), which is integrated with sensors that can measure normal and tangential forces at the fingertips. Sensorization of RPHs is a design requirement that should be considered as important as other functional requirements for hand prostheses, such as weight or dexterity. T o improve RPH performance and sensor integration, next-generation RPHs should then be designed with their sensorization in mind. Information about hand state (joint position, forces, and touch) can also be beneficial to increase the dexterity of such hands, enabling automatic adjustments such as catching slipping objects (e.g., the bebionic3 hand) and shared-control strategies (see Section 4).\n\n5.5.2. Improved stimulation strategies. Biomimicry is one of the strongest trends in nerve stimulation strategies, as it promises to deliver biologically plausible stimulation patterns to evoke more natural sensations. Biomimetic approaches rely on bio-inspired models to compute the stimulation patterns, so new iterations of these models, based on the current experience in stimulation and neural recording, are needed to improve the quality of elicited sensations.\n\nThese model-based approaches permit simpler modulation strategies that increase the naturalness of sensations. T an et al. (38), for example, proved that a sinusoidal modulation of the pulse width improves the naturalness of the sensation. Formento et al. (142) instead designed a strategy to activate asynchronously stimulated fibers, mimicking healthy neural activity; in their work, they replaced classical biphasic stimulation with a high-frequency burst of pulses that slowly increased in amplitude, and confirmed their hypothesis in ex vivo experiments. Stimulation patterns that try to overcome the physical limits of present neural interfaces (as in 142) while paving the way for more natural evoked sensations also suggest the requirements for the future generation of neural interfaces and stimulators for sensory feedback: increase reaching without losing discrimination.\n\n5.5.3. New computational architectures. Neuromorphic architectures have the potential to represent a paradigm shift in the design of the control systems for bidirectional hand prostheses, going toward distributed systems and edge computing. Both sensor acquisition and stimulation can benefit from these trends because they lead to more reliable systems that scale well with the increase of sensors and stimulation active sites. If the next generation of neuromorphic hardware promotes portability and lower power consumption, it could lead to broader implementation and adoption of neuromorphic systems in bidirectional hand prostheses.\n\nMany RPHs rely on advanced encoding and decoding algorithms implemented with neural networks (62), which are more computationally demanding than traditional approaches. It is interesting that even deep learning networks can be translated into spiking neural networks (143), possibly enabling full neuromorphic hardware encoding and decoding in future prostheses.\n",

The central theme is the integral role sensorization must play in the design of next-generation prosthetic hands to enhance performance, dexterity, and natural sensation.\n\nThe text highlights that sensorization should not be an afterthought but a fundamental design requirement equivalent to weight or dexterity. Embedded sensors measuring forces and joint positions enable more advanced control strategies like automatic slip prevention and shared control. Improved stimulation strategies aim to evoke more natural, biomimetic sensations by refining stimulation patterns based on neural models, overcoming current interface limitations. Neuromorphic computational architectures are presented as transformative for handling complex sensor data and stimulation in a portable, efficient manner, enabling scaling and more natural control.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the necessity of integrating sensorization early in the design process to fully realize these benefits and the importance of biomimicry and advanced computation for future prosthetic functionality.

MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach. Section 4.1 details different algorithmic approaches to decode motor functions, with an emphasis on sEMG; Section 4.2 discusses the addition of robotic automation to improve grasp robustness; Section 4.3 compares implanted methods to extract the user's intentions; and finally, Section 4.4 presents a perspective on the broader adoption of these techniques by patients.

It highlights that despite advanced prosthetic hardware, the dominant control approach remains body-powered or simple threshold-based surface electromyography (sEMG) decoding controlling mostly one degree of freedom (DOF). More advanced control schemes that allow multiple DOFs or continuous control exist but tend to be nonintuitive and come with usability challenges. This discrepancy leads to patient dissatisfaction and abandonment due to insufficient functional benefit relative to complexity and cost. The passage mentions various categories of control strategies, including classification vs. continuous control, robotic automation, implanted intention extraction, and broader patient adoption challenges.\n\nKey nuanced themes include:\n- The trade-off between mechanical sophistication and intuitive control usability.\n- The limitation of current control paradigms to single DOF or nonintuitive multi-DOF control.\n- Patient-centered concerns about cost-benefit and complexity leading to abandonment.\n- The landscape of emerging decoding techniques and their maturity levels.\n- The implication that advancing control algorithms must address usability and patient acceptance, not just technical performance.\n\nImplicit assumptions and underlying theories:\n- Usability and intuitive control are critical to patient adoption, possibly more than mechanical sophistication alone.\n- Surface EMG decoding methods have inherent limitations in multi-DOF control.\n- More complex control strategies risk adding cognitive load or nonintuitiveness.\n- Robotic automation and implanted methods offer potential improvements but have adoption barriers.\n\nThis context is highly technical and touches on biomechanics, neural decoding, human-machine interfaces, and patient-centered design considerations.

    "context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n",

Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n",

We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers.

    "context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",

    "context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n",
    "topic": "The trade-offs between electrode invasiveness and selectivity in neuromuscular interfaces and how these trade-offs differ between motor and sensory domains.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed, nuanced overview of neuromuscular interfaces, focusing on the trade-offs between invasiveness and selectivity of electrodes used for motor and sensory interfacing. Central ideas include the classification of electrodes by invasiveness (surface vs. implanted, including extraneural, intraneural, and regenerative), the importance of selectivity in spatial and temporal domains, and the multifactorial nature of interface performance beyond just invasiveness and selectivity (including geometry, material, and electrode configuration). The text highlights that while traditionally higher selectivity correlates with greater invasiveness, recent findings suggest this relationship differs between motor and sensory interfaces.\n\nThe context also compares specific electrode types (e.g., TIMEs vs. LIFEs) in their reach and ability to discriminate neural signals. Stability, signal quality, biocompatibility, and practical surgical considerations are emphasized, especially regarding sensory interfaces where consistent sensation quality is critical. The motor domain relies heavily on surface EMG with advances in high-density arrays, but implanted EMG and peripheral nerve interfaces are emerging with promising results. In contrast, sensory domain noninvasive methods lack consensus and are generally inferior to implanted intraneural interfaces, which provide more naturalistic feedback and functional restoration.\n\nThe implicit assumption is that interface design must balance invasiveness, selectivity, stability, and practical concerns differently depending on whether the goal is motor control or sensory feedback. This suggests domain-specific trade-offs and optimization strategies. This complexity and the emerging divergence in trade-offs between motor and sensory domains create a rich area for probing expert understanding.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 due to the need for integrating multi-dimensional aspects of interface design, understanding specific electrode technologies, and appreciating nuanced domain-specific trade-offs.\n\nThe planned question aims to challenge experts to analyze the fundamental differences in how invasiveness and selectivity trade-offs manifest differently in motor vs. sensory neuromuscular interfaces, requiring synthesis of electrode classification, functional outcomes, and practical implications. It encourages critical reflection on how these trade-offs affect interface design and clinical application.\n\nThis question is highly technical, conceptually deep, and requires expert-level comprehension of neural engineering principles and recent research insights.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do the trade-offs between electrode invasiveness and selectivity fundamentally differ between motor and sensory neuromuscular interfaces, and what implications do these differences have on the choice and design of electrodes for each domain?\nA: In the motor domain, higher invasiveness is necessary to achieve selectivity, whereas in the sensory domain, less invasive electrodes can provide comparable selectivity, allowing for simpler electrode designs.\nB: The sensory domain requires higher invasiveness for selectivity to achieve naturalistic feedback, whereas motor control can rely on less invasive, surface electrodes with lower selectivity due to muscle signal redundancy.\nC: Both motor and sensory domains require equally invasive electrodes to achieve high selectivity; thus, electrode design is primarily constrained by surgical feasibility rather than functional differences.\nD: Motor interfaces prioritize temporal selectivity achievable only with intraneural electrodes, while sensory interfaces rely mainly on spatial selectivity provided by extraneural electrodes, making invasiveness less critical for sensory feedback.\n\nExplanation: Sensory interfaces often demand higher invasiveness (e.g., intraneural electrodes) to achieve the selectivity necessary for naturalistic and discriminative feedback, as noninvasive approaches cannot match this performance; conversely, motor control can often be effectively achieved with less invasive surface EMG or extraneural electrodes due to the redundancy and robustness of muscle signals, making the invasiveness-selectivity trade-off domain-specific and influencing electrode choice accordingly.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",
    "topic": "Recent experimental validations of deep learning and domain adaptation approaches on amputee subjects for improved prosthetic hand control.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in electromyographic (EMG) decoding algorithms for prosthetic hand control, focusing on the evolution from simple threshold-based control to sophisticated pattern recognition, proportional control, and deep learning techniques. It highlights key challenges such as electrode placement variability, limited data availability for training, and the necessity for robustness to electrode shifts and inter-subject variability. The text emphasizes the paradigm shift from handcrafted feature engineering to deep learning with high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) inputs, which can exploit spatial information as image-like data, improving classification and regression performance for multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs). Importantly, it discusses domain adaptation (transfer learning) as a critical strategy to leverage data across multiple users, enabling better generalization and reducing the calibration burden for new amputee subjects.\n\nKey nuanced themes include:\n- The trade-offs between classical threshold-based and pattern recognition control in terms of intuitiveness and dexterity.\n- The advantages of HD-sEMG grids for spatial resolution and robustness to electrode displacement.\n- The challenges deep learning faces with limited labeled EMG data and the potential of domain adaptation to overcome these challenges.\n- The clinical and anatomical variability in amputee subjects that complicates electrode placement and signal decoding.\n- The implication that deep domain adaptation could significantly improve prosthetic control by learning generalized features transferable across users.\n\nImplicit assumptions and underlying theories:\n- EMG signals can be represented as spatial images to exploit computer vision techniques.\n- Motor unit decomposition adds granularity to signal interpretation.\n- Deep learning's success depends heavily on large datasets, motivating transfer learning for EMG.\n- Inter-subject variability is a major bottleneck in prosthetic control systems.\n\nPotential applications:\n- Developing prosthetic hands with high dexterity and robustness that require minimal user-specific calibration.\n- Creating adaptive prosthetic control systems that maintain performance over time despite physiological changes or electrode shifts.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 due to the advanced interdisciplinary knowledge required (biomedical engineering, machine learning, signal processing) and the subtlety of integrating domain adaptation with deep learning in a clinical neuroprosthetic context.\n\nThe question will focus on the conceptual and practical implications of using deep domain adaptation combined with HD-sEMG and deep learning to address challenges of inter-subject variability and limited training data in prosthetic hand control for amputees. This will probe an expert\u2019s understanding of the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and clinical application constraints.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of improving prosthetic hand control for amputee users, how does the integration of deep domain adaptation with high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) and deep learning specifically address the challenges posed by inter-subject variability and limited labeled training data, and what are the implications for the robustness and calibration requirements of control systems in practical clinical applications?\n\nA: Deep domain adaptation enables a pretrained deep learning model to generalize across multiple users by learning invariant EMG features from HD-sEMG spatial patterns, reducing the need for extensive user-specific data collection and increasing robustness to electrode displacement, thereby minimizing calibration time and improving consistent prosthetic control.\n\nB: Deep domain adaptation primarily increases the number of electrodes required in HD-sEMG arrays, which improves spatial resolution but does not affect calibration requirements or robustness to inter-subject variability.\n\nC: Deep domain adaptation eliminates the need for any training data by using a universal deep learning model trained on image datasets, which can directly decode EMG signals without user-specific adjustments.\n\nD: Deep domain adaptation focuses on reducing the physical size of prosthetic hands, thereby indirectly improving robustness and reducing calibration by limiting muscle signal variability.\n\nExplanation: Answer A correctly explains that deep domain adaptation leverages data from multiple subjects to learn generalized features from HD-sEMG data that are invariant to individual differences, which addresses inter-subject variability and limited training samples. This reduces calibration burden and improves robustness against electrode shifts, making control systems more practical for clinical use. Options B, C, and D either misrepresent the role of domain adaptation or focus on unrelated aspects.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

Among these, several references focus on sensory feedback modalities for prostheses, including vibrotactile, mechanotactile, and intraneural stimulation, and their impact on embodiment and functional outcomes. The references also cover the design of prosthetic hands, myoelectric control strategies, neural interfaces, and the evaluation of prosthetic function and user experience.\n\nThe central ideas relevant to the question topic involve the implementation of bidirectional sensory feedback (providing both motor control and sensory input) in prosthetic limbs and how different stimulation techniques affect user perception of embodiment and functional performance. Intraneural stimulation is highlighted for its biomimetic qualities and enhancement of natural sensation, which leads to improved manual dexterity. Vibrotactile and mechanotactile feedback are non-invasive methods that also influence embodiment but differ in efficacy and naturalness of sensation.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the importance of sensory feedback for prosthesis embodiment and functionality, the challenges of integrating effective feedback systems, and the trade-offs between invasiveness, naturalness, and practicality.

    "context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n",

Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n",

    "context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n",

    "context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",

It then contrasts this with pattern recognition methods that classify hand grasps based on multiple sEMG channels with higher accuracy and dexterity, including recent advances in single-finger and multi-finger classification and proportional control.\n\nThe text also discusses the challenges of electrode placement, variability in muscle anatomy, and electrode shift disrupting pattern recognition, leading to the introduction of high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) with spatially dense electrode grids. HD-sEMG allows interpreting EMG signals as spatial images, improving robustness and enabling motor unit decomposition. The section highlights a paradigm shift from handcrafted feature extraction to deep learning using raw HD-sEMG data, yielding superior performance in classification and regression tasks but requiring large datasets for training.\n\nTo mitigate the data requirement challenge, domain adaptation (transfer learning) methods are introduced, leveraging multi-subject data to accelerate and improve training for new users. This approach also enhances robustness to electrode shifts and reduces calibration needs.

    "context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a comprehensive overview of various assessment tools and methodologies used to evaluate prosthetic hand functions (RPHs), especially focusing on sensory feedback integration and cognitive load implications. It explains traditional tests like the Box and Block Test and its variants, and newer tests that assess grasping force control, sensory perception, and embodiment. Importantly, it discusses the use of cognitive dual tasks (e.g., counting backward, word finding) to indirectly measure the intuitiveness and attentional demands of prosthetic control by observing whether users can perform motor tasks while simultaneously engaging in a cognitive secondary task. It also mentions direct cognitive load measurements via EEG event-related potentials during dual tasks, where smaller auditory-evoked potentials indicate higher cognitive load on the prosthetic control task.\n\nThe nuanced theme is the relationship between cognitive load and intuitiveness of prosthetic control: intuitive control should require less focused attention, allowing simultaneous cognitive tasks without performance degradation. The context also highlights the challenges in developing validated measurement tools that capture the multifaceted aspects of prosthetic use, including sensorimotor integration, embodiment, and cognitive demands.\n\nGiven these insights, a highly challenging question would probe the rationale and mechanisms behind using cognitive dual-task paradigms to evaluate prosthetic intuitiveness and attentional demands, including the interpretation of neurophysiological correlates such as event-related potentials.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 \u2014 This question demands integrating knowledge of cognitive neuroscience, prosthetic control, sensorimotor integration, and psychometric evaluation methods.

If prosthetic control is intuitive and requires minimal focused attention, the user can perform both tasks simultaneously without significant performance loss. Event-related potentials measured via EEG track attention allocation by showing smaller amplitude responses to secondary auditory stimuli when more attention is dedicated to the primary prosthetic control task, thus providing objective neurophysiological evidence of cognitive load.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context is a table summarizing various clinical assessments used for transradial amputees employing robotic prosthetic hands. It categorizes assessments by the type of somatosensory feedback (implicit or explicit) they address and the aspects they measure: fine movement, measurement reach, grasp, embodiment, quality of life, and clinical validation. The table also notes the nature of measurement types (e.g., pick and place, psychometric tests, questionnaires) and references for each test.\n\nKey themes include the differentiation between implicit and explicit somatosensory feedback and how different assessments capture embodiment\u2014a critical, yet subtle, concept reflecting the integration of the prosthesis into the user's body schema. Embodiment measurements are sparse and appear in specific tests, highlighting the challenge in quantifying this phenomenon. The clinical relevance of these measurements lies in their potential to reflect user integration and acceptance of the prosthetic device beyond functional capabilities like grasp or movement.\n\nImplicit assumptions involve the idea that embodiment relates both to sensorimotor integration (captured in implicit tests) and cognitive or perceptual acceptance (explicit tests).

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160). It assesses four basic movements: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movements of extension and flexion at the elbow and shoulder. Variously sized and shaped objects from daily living (a cup, a washer, etc.) are used for the test, which provides a broad overview of patients' improvement in the activity and impairment domains. Finally, the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure uses a set of abstract objects and activities of daily living with tasks specifically developed to assess the effectiveness of upper-limb prostheses (161).\n",

    "context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n",

MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach. Section 4.1 details different algorithmic approaches to decode motor functions, with an emphasis on sEMG; Section 4.2 discusses the addition of robotic automation to improve grasp robustness; Section 4.3 compares implanted methods to extract the user's intentions; and finally, Section 4.4 presents a perspective on the broader adoption of these techniques by patients.

INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n",

It highlights the paradox where despite significant advancements in robotics, prosthetic technology has stagnated for many amputees, due largely to the intricate nature of replicating the human hand\u2019s functions. The hand\u2019s complexity is underscored by its dense sensory innervation, high degrees of freedom, and critical role in both sensory perception and manipulation.

    "context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses in detail the evolution and challenges of decoding algorithms for surface electromyography (sEMG) signals used in robotic prosthetic hand (RPH) control. Central ideas include the transition from simple threshold-based control using two sEMG channels to advanced pattern recognition and deep learning approaches using high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) grids. The text highlights the technical difficulties in electrode placement due to anatomical variability and the high sensitivity of pattern recognition to electrode displacement, which impacts long-term reliability. It also emphasizes the robustness improvements offered by HD-sEMG spatial imaging and deep learning methods, including domain adaptation techniques to cope with inter-subject variability and limited training data.\n\nA nuanced theme is the challenge of signal variability over time caused by electrode displacement and skin impedance changes, which threaten the stability and reliability of prosthetic control systems. The text suggests that while deep learning and HD-sEMG offer better robustness, they require large datasets and sophisticated adaptation to handle temporal signal evolution. Importantly, the text implies that without addressing signal variability over time, even advanced decoding algorithms may fail to maintain consistent performance for practical, long-term prosthetic use.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that anatomical variability and temporal changes in signal properties are inevitable and that current clinical approaches may not sufficiently address these issues. The underlying theory is that spatially rich, high-dimensional data combined with advanced machine learning can overcome these challenges, but practical deployment requires strategies like domain adaptation and tailored model architectures.\n\nGiven the complexity of neuroprosthetic control and the interplay of hardware limitations, signal processing, and machine learning, a highly challenging question can focus on the implications of signal variability for long-term control reliability and how emerging solutions address or fail to address these issues.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

    "context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ).

    "context": "## 2.1. Existing Robotic Prosthetic Hands\nNumerous commercially available RPH solutions use underactuated mechanisms ( Supplemental Table 1 ), including the Michelangelo prosthetic hand (Ottobock, Germany), the i-Limb Ultra (\u00d6ssur, Iceland), the bebionic hand (Ottobock), and the VINCENT evolution 3 (Vincent Systems, Germany). Despite remarkable advances, there is still arguably a trade-off between dexterity and weight in these solutions, with companies usually emphasizing one aspect or the other.\n\nMany research groups are currently working on innovative solutions to tackle the dexterity/ weight dilemma (19), such as the use of a monolithic 3D-printed soft material (20) or mechanical solutions to implement finger synergies via clutches (21). For example, Jing et al. (19) proposed an anthropomorphic RPH using only three motors that could achieve 13 grasp types while weighing only approximately 130 g.\n\nThe price of RPHs is an additional limiting factor for broader adoption by patients. With most advanced solutions costing $10,000-20,000, many researchers advocate for cheaper solutions, particularly for emerging countries (e.g., 22).\n\nOpen source RPHs are an exciting alternative to dramatically reduce the cost of development and distribution. One particularly interesting aspect of such hands is simplified maintenance and repairs (using, e.g., 3D printing) that do not rely on specific suppliers. For example, Open\n\nBionics (United Kingdom) commercializes solutions for transradial amputees (e.g., the medically certified Hero Arm) but also provides the source files for some of their designs, and e-NABLE ( https://enablingthefuture.org ) reports 8,000 recipients of their prosthetics, which were built by volunteers around the world. Open source RPHs also enable users to alter the design to meet their unique needs; for example, the Galileo Hand (23) allows easy customization of the types of movements and number of electromyography (EMG) electrodes.\n\nResearchers are also working on better mechanical solutions to improve RPH dexterity. An underactuated hand prosthesis designed by Abayasiri et al. (24) has finger abduction and adduction to enable it to grasp larger objects, and an adaptive prosthetic hand designed by Yong et al. (25) adds DOFs in the palm with movable metacarpals. The Karlsruhe Institute of T echnology (KIT) prosthetic hand (26) has an embedded camera and real-time object recognition, enabling the hand to be preshaped. Pneumatic artificial muscle (27) permits the development of light, compact solutions. Finally, biomimetic actuation is used for muscle-like actuators (15).\n\nIn addition to the hardware aspect, there are also innovations in RPH control and sensorization. Low-level controllers use information about the state of the device and eventually activate the actuation to meet the desired state imposed by the user's intentions. The choice of the state variable has a strong influence on how the device works. Position or speed can be read through encoders of each joint and controlled; these are straightforward approaches that have been used broadly in robotic applications. When the interaction of the hand with the external environment is of interest, more advanced control systems are implemented, such as torque or impedance control. Both approaches measure the force applied by the actuator, controlling it directly in the first case and simulating compliance in the second. Advanced control strategies enable complex manipulation and smoother gestures at the expense of a bulkier mechanical structure and a more complex control system. Therefore, enabling more sophisticated control requires integrated force and position sensors, which have been previously developed mainly to close the robotic control loop (28).\n\nIn summary, low-cost and light hands have flourished over the last few years. The race to simplify designs and reduce costs through 3D printing should not impact the dexterity of RPHs. For now, underactuated mechanisms are the best solution for RPHs and innovative designs based on synergy mechanisms or friction, the latter of which can help increase the number of DOAs without increasing the number of motors.\n",

It references specific commercial models, research innovations targeting the dexterity/weight trade-off, and the impact of cost on accessibility. It also mentions open-source prosthetics enabling customization and maintenance advantages. Key technical insights include the use of synergy mechanisms and friction to increase degrees of actuation (DOAs) without adding motors, a critical design strategy to improve dexterity without sacrificing weight or cost.\n\nThe text emphasizes that underactuation is currently the best practical approach for RPHs, allowing multiple joints or DOFs to be driven by fewer actuators via mechanical linkages, synergies, or friction-based solutions. It also notes advanced control strategies (position, torque, impedance control) but highlights their complexity and potential bulkiness.\n\nImplicit in the discussion is the engineering challenge of achieving anthropomorphic dexterity and multiple grasp types with minimal weight and cost, motivating innovations such as clutch-based synergies, movable metacarpals, and pneumatic muscles.

    "context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n",

It highlights the trade-offs between invasiveness and selectivity, the importance of electrode geometry and materials, and the emerging strategies to improve device-tissue interfaces, including electrode coatings and innovative designs like hollow glass cones for neurite ingrowth. These coatings and novel interface designs contribute to signal quality, stability, and biocompatibility, which are crucial for long-term performance and stable sensory feedback. The text also emphasizes the significance of anchoring electrodes to neural tissue to maintain steady contact and the challenges of balancing invasiveness with functional gains, especially in sensory versus motor domains.\n\nImplicitly, the passage suggests that advancements in electrode coating and interface design can potentially alter traditional trade-offs between invasiveness and selectivity, improving both neural signal discrimination and biocompatibility.

    "context": "## 6. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160). It assesses four basic movements: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movements of extension and flexion at the elbow and shoulder. Variously sized and shaped objects from daily living (a cup, a washer, etc.) are used for the test, which provides a broad overview of patients' improvement in the activity and impairment domains. Finally, the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure uses a set of abstract objects and activities of daily living with tasks specifically developed to assess the effectiveness of upper-limb prostheses (161).\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the importance of standardized performance assessment tools for evaluating sensorimotor prosthetic hands (RPHs), emphasizing not only biological impairments but also activity limitations and participation restrictions. It highlights various well-established functional tests, such as the Box and Block Test, Nine Hole Peg Test, Clothespin Relocation Test, and Action Research Arm Test, which assess different aspects of upper-limb dexterity and function. Importantly, the context notes adaptations of these tests incorporating motion capture and kinematic analysis to detect compensatory movement strategies, such as unusual shoulder or trunk movements during prosthetic use, thus providing deeper insight into movement quality beyond task completion alone. This implies that kinematic data can reveal subtle motor control deficiencies or compensations that might not be evident from task success metrics alone. The discussion also integrates the relevance of somatosensory feedback and sensorimotor integration in evaluating prosthetic efficacy, indicating that motor performance tests may indirectly reflect sensory feedback quality. The text thus establishes a complex, multi-dimensional framework for assessing prosthetic function that combines quantitative kinematic analysis with qualitative outcome measures, addressing both physical and psychosocial domains.\n\nImplicit assumptions include the idea that effective prosthetic assessment must go beyond simple task scores to include movement quality and compensatory strategies, which can influence long-term musculoskeletal health and user satisfaction.

    "context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",

It also covers technical challenges like electrode placement variability, the use of HD-sEMG for spatial robustness, and the recent paradigm shift toward deep learning and domain adaptation to improve robustness and dexterity.\n\nThe segment on nonbiomimetic EMG decoders is particularly interesting: rather than mimicking biological mappings, these decoders provide an arbitrary abstract control space that users learn to control through training, effectively learning an inverse map from EMG to control commands. This concept implies a fundamental shift from decoder-driven interpretation of biological signals to user-driven adaptation to decoder mappings.\n\nThis nuanced concept invites deep reflection on the implications of such a control strategy compared to biomimetic or pattern recognition approaches.

We argue that the motor and sensory domains raise different problems. Indeed, the stimulation being close to the target is mandatory with current technologies, and therefore the best solutions are the most invasive ones. In the motor domain, it is possible to decompose the signal if we have enough sources (even noninvasive sources, as with sEMG). As shown in Section 4, machine learning techniques can help infer information from noninvasive interfaces.\n\nOn the sensory level, the currently implantable electrodes are the most promising solution. However, the main advancement so far has been for the tactile modality, while the use of other modalities for proprioception has been obtained via a nonhomologous approach based on intraneural stimulation combined with the delivery of homologous tactile feedback via indirectly targeted intraneural electrical stimulation (64).\n\nTemperature sensation is another limit. T emperature is mediated through A \u03b4 fibers (for cold) and C fibers (for warmth). Given the very small size of these fibers (C fibers are 20-100 times smaller than A \u03b2 fibers), it is not possible to target them using existing state-of-the-art electrodes (42). Future electrodes with even higher levels of selectivity might be able to target A \u03b4 and C fibers.

Temperature sensation is mediated by very small nerve fibers (A\u03b4 for cold and C fibers for warmth) which are currently untargetable by existing electrodes due to their size.

Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging.

CONCLUSION\nMorethan20years ago,remarkable results by a group of French surgeons for hand transplantation (8) had raised hopes for a future where grafting would be the norm and prosthetics eventually obsolete (176). However, not only has this prediction-unfortunately-not yet come to pass, but also the adoption of new RPH technologies has been slower than expected. As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback. We have proposed here an outline of possible iterations of RPHs for the next few years and for 5-10 years in the future.\n\nIn our view, there could soon be a broader integration of simple somatosensory feedback using mature implantable techniques, such as cuff electrodes. Motor decoding using machine learning and shared-control algorithms could permit continuous command of single fingers and broader sets of grasps. Ultimately, the next generation of prosthetics could use more advanced soft implantable electrodes, which could enable more sophisticated sensory encoding (proprioception, temperature perception, touch perception, and nociception) and motor decoding using, for example, deep learning techniques. But to reach this goal, the field must tackle significant challenges related to system integration, electronic miniaturization, computational power, surgical procedure, electrode robustness, the robotic hand itself, and the encoding of somatosensory information.\n",

    "context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n",

    "context": "## 5. RESTORING SENSORY FEEDBACK\nSensory information plays a critical role in both the exploration of the external environment and in any manipulation task. When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface. Prec vious sections have described the different available interfaces; here, we present the encoding techniques and sensors relevant to the design of modern hand prostheses ( Table 1 ).\n\nSensors mounted on a robotic hand should ideally record the whole spectrum of available human sensations, from both external and internal sources. Indeed, sensory information from the human hand covers both interactions with the external world (tactile perception, thermal perception, and nociception, i.e., perception of pain) and internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles, together known as proprioception. Table 2 shows examples of sensor placements on RPHs from recent studies.\n",

Sensors for Proprioception\nProprioception is not only fundamental for a dexterous hand prosthesis, enabling vision-free manipulation and multitasking, but is also the key to a properly embodied device (64). Usually, kinematic parameters of the robotic hand and (when available) the force exerted are needed to implement low-level control of the actuators, so they are measured with well-established systems, such as rotary encoders or the motor's current draw.\n\n\n## 5.2. Tactile Sensors\nDespite improvements in sensor miniaturization,computational power,and knowledge of the neurophysiology of somatosensation (tactile sensation and proprioception), the capabilities of sensorized RPHs remain far from those of a natural hand. Overcoming this limitation will require satisfying three conditions: The sensors must match the skin's sensing ability, a sufficient number of sensors must be embedded on the surface of the hand, and it must be possible to reliably read information from them. The first condition can be addressed with current technology, as the resolution of existing force and pressure sensors already matches human skin performance (120). However, fulfilling the second and third conditions is another matter, and we need to push the boundaries of circuit integration in order to create an RPH with many sensors and a way to communicate with them.\n\nThe classical solution of using general-purpose sensors developed separately from the signal conditioning circuit and the subsequent signal processing has shown its limit. Instead, efforts are being made to optimize these devices with prosthetics in mind. For example, borrowing the concept of morphological computation from robotics (121), sensors can be optimized for specific tasks by tuning the features of their mechanical structures accordingly. Indeed, exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination (61, 115). Another example comes from Kim et al.

Overcoming this limitation will require satisfying three conditions: The sensors must match the skin's sensing ability, a sufficient number of sensors must be embedded on the surface of the hand, and it must be possible to reliably read information from them. The first condition can be addressed with current technology, as the resolution of existing force and pressure sensors already matches human skin performance (120). However, fulfilling the second and third conditions is another matter, and we need to push the boundaries of circuit integration in order to create an RPH with many sensors and a way to communicate with them.\n\nThe classical solution of using general-purpose sensors developed separately from the signal conditioning circuit and the subsequent signal processing has shown its limit. Instead, efforts are being made to optimize these devices with prosthetics in mind. For example, borrowing the concept of morphological computation from robotics (121), sensors can be optimized for specific tasks by tuning the features of their mechanical structures accordingly. Indeed, exploiting the low-pass filtering effect of a compliant material or surfaces with specific structures can increase texture discrimination (61, 115). Another example comes from Kim et al. (122), who measured forces using sensors embedded in a soft substrate.\n\n)\n\nContinued\n\n(\n\n| Sensor distribution a                       |            |             |             |             |                  |              |                 |              |\n\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n\n| Interface                                   | G10 tactor | TIME        | TENS        | TIME        | FINE             | TIME         | Vibrators       | TENS         |\n\n| Electrical stimulation encoding Pulse width | -          | Fixed       | Linear      | Fixed       | Time variant     | Fixed        | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Amplitude                                   | -          | Linear      | Fixed       | Model based | Fixed            | Fixed        | -               | Fixed        |\n\n| Frequency                                   | -          | Fixed       | Fixed       | Model based | Linear           | Neuromorphic | -               | Neuromorphic |\n\n| Mechanical stimulation encoding             | Linear     | -           | -           | -           | -                | -            | Discrete events | -            |\n\n| RPH model                                   | Passive    | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | IH2 Azzurra | SensorHand Speed | IH2 Azzurra  | Various         | bebionic     |\n\n| Reference                                   | 4          | 6           | 60          | 62          | 38               | 61           | 129             | 59           |\n\n| Year                                        | 2011       | 2014        | 2017        | 2018        | 2014             | 2016         | 2016            | 2018         |\n",

    "context": "## 4.3. Decoding Motor Intention via Implanted Electrodes\nSurface electrodes cannot precisely record the signal from deep muscles; to overcome this issue, several groups have focused on iEMG electrodes. This technique is more invasive but allows one to record EMG signals (51) uncorrelated from the underlying musculature and avoids the daily placement of electrodes. iEMG is robust against electrode shift (e.g., socket rotation) and change in skin impedance and sweat. Several studies have demonstrated the performance of simultaneous wrist and hand motions (three DOFs) using six to eight iEMG electrodes; Smith &amp; Hargrove (51) showed that iEMG has better decoding performance than sEMG. High decoding performance is reported in real time (106), and in fully implanted setups, the results are stable for several days (107).\n\nOnthe other hand, Farrell &amp; Weir (52) compared the pattern recognition-based grasp classification performance of iEMG and sEMG on 12 movement classes with eight channels and did not find a statistical difference between electrode types. They concluded that the choice of electrode should be based not on classification accuracy but rather on signal consistency over time and robustness to electrode lift-off. Zia ur Rehman et al. (108) compared a standard linear discriminant analysis with a deep network for grasp classification. They performed a multiday analysis comparing six iEMG and six sEMG electrodes, and their results showed that deep learning had better decoding performance and was more stable over time.\n\nKamavuako et al. (109) investigated the effect of combining iEMG to target deep muscles with sEMG on myoelectric control. They showed that the combined solution improved offline and real-time control performance compared with sEMG alone.\n\nWith 32 iEMG electrodes, Dantas et al. (110) compared different decoding methods for the continuous control of five DOFs corresponding to the flexion and extension of each digit. Using a data set aggregation algorithm, they showed a normalized mean squared error as low as 0.033 with a deep convolutional neural network. They also investigated signal stability for 150 days after training, showing a small degradation during the first month (0.003 normalized mean squared error per day with a convolutional neural network), but that degradation stopped in the next four months.\n\nFor transradial amputees, an alternative to using EMG signals to control hand prostheses is decoding from peripheral nerve signals. Different grasp types can be decoded from peripheral nerve signals with high accuracy using different interfaces, both offline and in real time (54, 111113). Implanted peripheral nerve recordings are more invasive than sEMG but are more stable over time. Indeed, donning and doffing the prosthesis does not move these electrodes as much as it does sEMG electrodes. Recently, Cracchiolo et al. (53) decoded up to 11 class states using TIMEs on an amputee subject and showed that the active sites chosen on the first day could also be used in the following sessions, for up to seven days (80% accuracy, compared with 83% by selecting active sites every session). However, this modality is generally used to provide sensory\n\nfeedback (64, 114-116). Therefore the development of new approaches to record neural signals during peripheral stimulation [e.g., artifact removal (117)] is necessary.\n\nVu et al. (39) recently developed a regenerative peripheral nerve interface to increase signal specificity and long-term stability. They implanted transected peripheral nerves into a free muscle graft. After regeneration, revascularization, and reinnervation, the graft becomes a nerve bioamplifier that creates EMG signals. Using chronically implanted iEMG to record from these grafts, they performed five-class decoding in real time with up to 98.2% accuracy with two transradial amputees in a virtual hand environment. They also showed results from a Box and Block T est using an RPH that provided continuous control of two DOFs of thumb motions through their interface combined with a third DOF based on sEMG.\n",

The text discusses different decoding methods such as linear discriminant analysis, deep neural networks, and convolutional networks, alongside metrics like classification accuracy and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). It also highlights multiday stability assessments and the importance of signal consistency over pure classification accuracy. The mention of specific studies with concrete performance metrics (e.g., NMSE as low as 0.033, 98.2% accuracy, 80% vs. 83% accuracy in repeated sessions) reflects the importance of evaluating both instantaneous decoding accuracy and longitudinal robustness. Additionally, the text notes the need for artifact removal in peripheral nerve recordings when combined with sensory feedback stimulation. \n\nImplicit assumptions include that decoding performance metrics must be balanced with practical considerations such as electrode stability and real-world usability. The use of advanced machine learning models is shown to improve performance and stability, but the choice of electrode type is nuanced and context-dependent.

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n",

    "context": "## 4.2. Shared Control to Help Motor Decoding\nThe ultimate goal of RPH control is to be as close as possible to controlling a natural hand. Therefore, an ideal control needs to be intuitive and continuous over individual fingers and wrist movements. Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder. Since reliability is one of the main factors for upper-limb prosthesis users (102), this is a significant issue for the commercialization of more dexterous control schemes.\n\nOne possible solution to improve decoding robustness is to add robotic automation of some portion of the motor command. Shared-control strategies between a subject and a smart robotic hand have been reported for automated preshaping and grasping (103), grip force adjustment\n\n(104), slip detection, and hand closing (105). In the context of single-finger proportional control, Zhuang et al. (79) proposed a shared-control strategy to increase grasp robustness (avoiding accidental drops), by maximizing the number of contacts between the RPH and an object while allowing the user to maintain full autonomy over decisions about grasping and releasing, grasp preshaping, and non-grasp-related motions. These strategies allow both freedom during singlefinger control and robustness during a grasp event (79) and can perform more dexterous movements that cannot be decoded based on EMG alone. However, they necessitate many DOAs (e.g., active control of each phalanx to reposition the fingers around an object), which is still a significant challenge in terms of motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the intrinsic trade-off in upper-limb prosthetic hand control between increasing degrees of freedom (DOFs) for enhanced dexterity and the consequent decrease in motor decoder robustness. The central idea is that while more DOFs and proportional control provide more natural, continuous, and dexterous movement, they make decoding motor commands from EMG signals less reliable, which is a critical limitation for commercialization and user acceptance. The passage then explores shared control strategies as a mitigation approach, where robotic automation complements user input to improve grasp robustness and avoid accidental drops. This approach balances user autonomy with automated stability, enabling complex movements beyond what EMG decoding alone can achieve. However, implementing these solutions requires many degrees of actuation (DOAs), which introduces challenges in miniaturization, power, and cost. \n\nImplicit in this discussion is the assumption that EMG-based decoding robustness inversely correlates with the number of DOFs controlled, and that shared control can optimize the trade-off by automating certain aspects of hand movement while preserving user intent. The passage also hints at the practical engineering challenges that limit how finely actuated prosthetic hands can become despite control advancements.\n\nDifficulty is rated 9/10 due to the nuanced understanding required about the interplay between motor decoding, control strategies, and prosthetic design constraints.\n\nThe question should challenge experts to analyze the fundamental trade-offs in control complexity versus robustness, the role of shared control, and the practical engineering implications for prosthetic hands.\n\nThis will provoke reflection on how to balance dexterity and reliability in prosthetic control, the limitations of EMG decoding, and the impact of adding robotic automation under resource constraints.\n\nNo irrelevant or bogus information is present.\n\nTherefore, a single highly technical, synthesis question will be generated.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does increasing the degrees of freedom in upper-limb prosthetic hand control fundamentally affect motor decoder robustness, and why do shared-control strategies present a viable solution despite introducing challenges in miniaturization and power consumption?\n\nA: Increasing degrees of freedom enhances motor decoder robustness by simplifying EMG signal patterns; shared-control strategies automate all movements, eliminating the need for user input and reducing miniaturization challenges.\n\nB: Increasing degrees of freedom decreases motor decoder robustness by complicating EMG signal interpretation; shared-control strategies mitigate this by automating portions of the motor command, maintaining user autonomy while improving reliability, though this increases requirements for miniaturization and power.\n\nC: Increasing degrees of freedom has no significant effect on motor decoder robustness; shared-control strategies primarily address cost reduction rather than control reliability or miniaturization.\n\nD: Increasing degrees of freedom improves motor decoder robustness by allowing proportional control of individual fingers; shared-control strategies reduce the number of degrees of actuation needed, simplifying prosthetic design and power consumption.\n\nExplanation: Increasing degrees of freedom complicates decoding EMG signals, reducing robustness because more complex signals are harder to interpret reliably. Shared-control strategies complement user input by automating parts of the hand movements, thereby improving grasp reliability without sacrificing user autonomy, but this requires many degrees of actuation, leading to challenges in miniaturization, power, and cost.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

    "context": "## Figure 3\nExamples of available assessment tools. ( a ) The standardized test equipment for the Box and Block T est includes a box with two compartments separated by a barrier and 150 2.5-cm colored blocks. The subject is asked to transfer as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the other in one minute. Panel adapted with permission from Accsim Instrumentos. ( ) The Clothespin Relocation b Test measures hand function (reaching, grasping, and wrist rotation). The measurement consists of the time it takes for the subject to move three clothespins from a horizontal to a vertical bar and then back (see, e.g., 184). Panel adapted with permission from Reference 184. ( ) The Action Research Arm T est standard box is commercially available and contains different objects to assess grasp, grip pinch, c and gross movement functions. Panel reproduced with permission from Rehab Solutions. ( d ) The Virtual Egg T est is a variation of the Box and Block T est where blocks are replaced by breakable objects. In this example, the plastic cubes have a magnetic fuse that breaks if the grasping force exceeds a certain threshold. Panel adapted with permission from Reference 129. ( ) An audio-tactile interaction task e has been used to measure the brain representation of the peripersonal space (the brain's presentation of the space immediately around the body) (175). The test consists of a looming sound (perceived as coming from far away and moving toward the amputated hand) and a vibrator placed on the subject's stump that is triggered when the sound is perceived to be at different distances from the subject (D1 to D5). The position where the presence of the sound facilitates the perception of the vibrator (reaction time) is used as a proxy for the peripersonal space limit ( dashed line ).\n\nThese evaluations are used in rehabilitation and have been clinically validated ( Table 3 ). Most of them were developed for neurological impairments (such as a stroke), multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injuries and have been adapted for the evaluation of RPHs. While these wellestablished evaluations are essential, detailed investigation of RPHs-mainly when integrating sensory feedback capabilities-implies specific challenges that have been addressed in a series of tests introduced in recent years. These tests, although not yet clinically validated, are, in our opinion, of great interest.\n\nThe Grasping Relative Index of Performance measures the ability to control the desired force during grasping (139) independently from the control and feedback modalities. This measurement is based on the well-known Fitts' law, which states that the difficulty of a reaching task is given by the log of the ratio between the distance to the target and its size; in other words, the farther away and smaller a target is, the harder it is to reach it. Thumser et al. (162) argued that grasping is similar to pointing with the thumb and finger toward selected positions and defined the index of difficulty for grasping as the ratio of the object's weight to its hardness (where grasping a fragile object is analogous to reaching a small target). Other assessments have been proposed to estimate object stiffness (139) and size discrimination (6); Risso et al. (163) investigated the contribution of vision, tactile feedback via intraneural stimulation, and visuo-tactile integration to estimate the size of a handheld object.\n\nThe magnetic table task (164) and the Virtual Egg T est (129) ( Figure 3 d ) are variations of the Box and Block T est in which the blocks are replaced by magnetic cubes and breakable objects, respectively. Both have been used to evaluate the efficacy of different sensory encoding strategies (see 136 for the magnetic table task and 62 for the Virtual Egg T est). Finally, Prosthesis Efficiency and Profitability is an ad hoc measurement for prosthetics with sensory feedback to assess searching, reaching, grasping, manipulating, and decision-making during a foraging task (139).\n\nUse of cognitive load during a sensorimotor task can give an indirect evaluation of the intuitiveness of a task: Do patients need to give their full attention to a particular movement, or are they able to perform it as part of a dual task? Subjects might be asked, for example, to perform a task while counting backward, finding words that start with a given letter, or visually following a moving target on a screen (for an example with a Virtual Egg T est, see 63). More direct measurement of the cognitive burden via electroencephalographic event-related potentials during human-machine interactions has also been proposed (165). Here, the subject must perform a specific task (the primary task) while detecting an auditory stimulus (the secondary task), and the amplitude of the event-related potentials in response to the auditory stimulus then indicates the amount of dedicated attention to the secondary and primary tasks. Simply put, a small response to the auditory cue suggests more extensive attention to the primary task (166) and therefore a greater cognitive load.\n\nThe prolonged use of prosthetic limbs can reverse some of the effects of post-traumatic maladaptive plasticity, one of the most debilitating of which is phantom limb pain, a condition present in the majority of subjects with amputation (167). Phantom limb pain has a complex etiology that can be elicited by a multitude of factors, including nociceptive (neuroma hyperactivity), neuropathic (cortical reorganization), or psychogenic mechanisms. Numerous studies have shown that the use of prosthetics with sensory feedback significantly reduces phantom limb pain for upperlimb (38, 112, 114) and lower-limb (166) amputees. T ypical measurements of pain are the McGill Pain Questionnaire (168), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (169), and the Visual Analog Pain intensity scale, but it can also be measured with the DASH assessment (146) and the physical domain of the WHOQOL test.\n\nLongitudinal experiments with amputee patients have demonstrated changes in body schema representation and embodiment of the prosthetic when tactile (62, 170) or proprioceptive (171) feedback is provided to the subject. A questionnaire-based measurement inspired by the rubber hand illusion (172) is often used. T ools for psychometrical measurement of the embodiment include a visuo-tactile integration task (173) and a cross-modal congruency task (174). A similar protocol using audio-tactile stimuli (175) revealed changes of the peripersonal space around the stump following prolonged use of a prosthetic limb ( Figure 3 e ). In the same study, the authors used a tactile distance perception task in subjects' healthy and amputated arms to measure the perceived length of the remaining part of the upper limb and the homologous region of the healthy limb.\n\nEtiology: the cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of a disease or condition\n\nThere is no single measurement that assesses all aspects of the use of an RPH. T o evaluate the validity of novel technology, the experimenter should consider the multifaceted aspects of the impairment and subjects' biopsychosocial welfare, which is possible only via a series of tools, as presented in this section. In the case of prosthetics with sensory feedback, there is a lack of validated and well-established measurements, but several research groups are working to define adapted measurements, which might become the new norm in the future.\n",

    "context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n",

    "context": "## Figure 2\nA neural interface and the target area for somatosensory feedback. ( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context presents a comprehensive comparison between noninvasive and invasive methods for delivering somatosensory feedback via neural interfaces. It details the types of mechanoreceptors targeted by noninvasive approaches (e.g., tactors activating Meissner corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles, TENS), and contrasts these with invasive peripheral nerve stimulation techniques such as cuff electrodes, FINEs, TIMEs, and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays that stimulate nerves from inside or outside the fibers. The context emphasizes the advantages of invasive peripheral nerve stimulation in eliciting more natural, intuitive, and spatially precise sensations by stimulating the peripheral nervous system directly\u2014the biological pathway for sensory information\u2014compared to noninvasive methods limited by spatial precision and sensory threshold variability.\n\nFurther, it discusses how invasive stimulation can be modulated not just proportionally to sensor values but also using biomimetic and neuromorphic patterns that mimic natural afferent firing, improving naturalness, intuitiveness, and functional outcomes such as dexterity and texture discrimination. The text also mentions spinal cord stimulation as a promising middle ground due to its regulatory approval and less invasive nature but acknowledges challenges in producing natural sensations that biomimetic patterns might overcome.\n\nImplicit in the analysis is the trade-off between invasiveness and sensory quality: invasive methods require complex surgery but yield higher embodiment and richer sensory feedback; noninvasive methods are simpler but constrained in precision and naturalness. The challenges of EMG interference and calibration in noninvasive electrotactile and electrocutaneous stimulation are also highlighted, underscoring practical limitations.\n\nThe difficulty level is high (rated 9/10) due to the integration of neurophysiology, biomedical engineering, signal modulation techniques, and the nuanced understanding of sensory encoding and prosthetic embodiment.\n\nThe question should probe the rationale behind preferring invasive peripheral neural interfaces over noninvasive methods, focusing on the neurophysiological basis for naturalness and intuitiveness, the technical implications for spatial precision, and the ultimate impact on embodiment and functional prosthetic use.

CONCLUSION\nMorethan20years ago,remarkable results by a group of French surgeons for hand transplantation (8) had raised hopes for a future where grafting would be the norm and prosthetics eventually obsolete (176). However, not only has this prediction-unfortunately-not yet come to pass, but also the adoption of new RPH technologies has been slower than expected. As such, RPHs are still a field of active research. Significant efforts have been made to reduce their price and weight, improve their aesthetics and anthropomorphism, increase the robustness and accuracy of their motor intention decoding, and provide natural and accurate somatosensory feedback. We have proposed here an outline of possible iterations of RPHs for the next few years and for 5-10 years in the future.\n\nIn our view, there could soon be a broader integration of simple somatosensory feedback using mature implantable techniques, such as cuff electrodes. Motor decoding using machine learning and shared-control algorithms could permit continuous command of single fingers and broader sets of grasps. Ultimately, the next generation of prosthetics could use more advanced soft implantable electrodes, which could enable more sophisticated sensory encoding (proprioception, temperature perception, touch perception, and nociception) and motor decoding using, for example, deep learning techniques. But to reach this goal, the field must tackle significant challenges related to system integration, electronic miniaturization, computational power, surgical procedure, electrode robustness, the robotic hand itself, and the encoding of somatosensory information.\n",

    "question": "Considering the demonstrated long-term (>5 years) stability of implanted flat interface nerve electrodes (FINE) and short-term (up to 13 days) home-use electrical stimulation for sensory feedback, which of the following best explains the primary challenge in translating implanted sensory feedback systems into widespread, reliable home-use applications for upper-limb prosthesis users?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Ensuring that the sensory feedback encoding via implanted electrodes can robustly convey complex object properties such as shape and stiffness without degradation over extended daily use.",
      "B": "Overcoming signal variability caused by external factors such as sweating, arm positioning, and socket rotation that affect implanted electrode performance.",
      "C": "Addressing the immunological rejection and surgical complications inherent to long-term implantation of sensory electrodes, which currently limit their clinical viability.",
      "D": "Developing fully implanted myoelectric sensors to replace surface electromyography (sEMG) control systems, which are inherently unreliable for grasp classification."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Although implanted FINE electrodes have shown stability over more than five years, the primary limitation for home-use sensory feedback lies in ensuring that the stimulation protocols can deliver consistent, meaningful sensory information reliably during extended daily use without performance degradation.

Historically, humans have replaced a missing limb with a prosthesis for cosmetic, vocational, or personal autonomy reasons. The hand is a powerful tool, and its loss causes severe physical and often mental debilitation. Technological advancements have allowed the development of increasingly effective artificial hands, which can improve the quality of life of people who suffered a hand amputation. Here, we review the state of the art of robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs), with particular attention to the potential and current limits of their main building blocks: the hand itself, approaches to decoding voluntary commands and controlling the hand, and systems and methods for providing sensory feedback to the user. We also briefly describe existing approaches to characterizing the performance of subjects using RPHs for grasping tasks and provide perspectives on the future of different components and the overall field of RPH development.\n",
    "topic": "The importance of combining voluntary control and sensory feedback to achieve more natural and effective prosthetic hand function.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context is an abstract and metadata from a scientific review article on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs). It highlights the importance of prosthetic hands as functional replacements for lost limbs, emphasizing the hand\u2019s critical role and the severe impact of its loss. The text mentions three main components of RPHs: the prosthetic hand device itself, the decoding and control of voluntary commands (likely via electromyography or neural interfaces), and the provision of sensory feedback to the user. The abstract suggests that combining these elements\u2014particularly voluntary control and sensory feedback\u2014is essential for improving function and user experience. It also alludes to limitations and challenges in current technologies and the need for better performance characterization and future advancements.\n\nThe analysis identifies the central theme of the importance of integrating voluntary motor control and sensory feedback to achieve more natural and effective prosthetic function. This integration is crucial for replicating the natural sensorimotor loop of the biological hand, which allows fluid, adaptive, and precise manipulation.\n\nImplicit assumptions include: \n- That voluntary command decoding alone is insufficient for natural prosthetic use.\n- Sensory feedback enhances control by providing the user with real-time information about the prosthetic hand\u2019s state.\n- There is a complex interplay between control algorithms and sensory inputs that must be optimized.\nPotential applications include improved prosthesis design, control strategies, and rehabilitation protocols.\n\nThe difficulty rating is 9/10 because it requires understanding neuroprosthetics, sensorimotor integration, and the technical challenges of prosthetic hand control and feedback systems. The question should probe the expert\u2019s comprehension of why the integration of voluntary control and sensory feedback is critical, what challenges arise, and the implications for future prosthetic development.\n\nThe question will encourage reflection on the interplay between motor intention and sensory information, the limitations of current systems, and how this integration influences prosthetic effectiveness and naturalness.\n\nGiven the abstract nature of the provided text and its focus on the interplay between control and feedback, the question will be conceptual and analytical, challenging a domain expert\u2019s ability to synthesize knowledge about neuroprosthetics.\n\nNo irrelevant or bogus information was detected. The content is meaningful and appropriate for generating a highly technical, insightful question and answer.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Why is the integration of voluntary motor command decoding and sensory feedback crucial for achieving natural and effective control in robotic prosthetic hands, and what are the primary challenges in implementing this integration in current neuroprosthetic systems?\n\nA: Because voluntary motor commands alone provide sufficient control, sensory feedback is redundant; the main challenge is miniaturizing hardware.\n\nB: Because sensory feedback compensates for the absence of natural proprioception and touch, enabling adaptive and precise manipulation; challenges include accurate decoding of motor intent and delivering intuitive, timely sensory signals.\n\nC: Because sensory feedback replaces the need for voluntary control by automating hand movements; the main challenge is developing fully autonomous prosthetics.\n\nD: Because voluntary control and sensory feedback operate independently without interaction; the main challenge is integrating the prosthetic hand mechanically with the residual limb.\n\nExplanation: The integration is critical because voluntary motor commands provide intent but lack the natural sensory signals (proprioception and tactile feedback) necessary for adaptive, precise control; without this feedback, users rely on visual cues alone, reducing effectiveness and naturalness. The primary challenges include accurately decoding the user\u2019s motor intentions from noisy biological signals and delivering sensory feedback that is intuitive, timely, and perceived as natural by the user.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

    "context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",

Central ideas include the progression from hand-crafted feature extraction to deep neural networks for automatic feature learning, the benefits of HD-sEMG in spatial resolution and robustness to electrode shifts, and the promising improvements deep learning brings in accuracy and dexterity. However, the text also critically addresses significant challenges: the large data requirements deep learning demands, difficulties in generalizing models across different users, and the need for domain adaptation or transfer learning to mitigate these issues. The text also touches on the physiological and practical constraints in electrode placement and signal variability over time, emphasizing why deep learning models must be tailored to bio-signal characteristics and temporal variations.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that deep learning can outperform classical methods given sufficient data and proper adaptation, and that interuser variability is a major bottleneck in practical deployment. The mention of domain adaptation strategies underscores the importance of leveraging multi-subject datasets to reduce calibration burden for new users.

    "context": "## 5.5. Perspectives\nWe believe that sensorization will play a significant role in the next generation of RPHs. Here, we discuss three main directions influenced by sensorization: embedded sensorization, improved stimulation strategies, and new computational architectures.\n\n5.5.1. Embedded sensorization. Sensorized hands are not yet prevalent in the literature but are starting to draw interest, especially with the improvement of interfaces for bidirectional prostheses (for a list of RPHs with sensorized fingertips, see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). As a recent example, Controzzi et al. (141) developed the Mia hand (Prensilia, Italy), which is integrated with sensors that can measure normal and tangential forces at the fingertips. Sensorization of RPHs is a design requirement that should be considered as important as other functional requirements for hand prostheses, such as weight or dexterity. T o improve RPH performance and sensor integration, next-generation RPHs should then be designed with their sensorization in mind. Information about hand state (joint position, forces, and touch) can also be beneficial to increase the dexterity of such hands, enabling automatic adjustments such as catching slipping objects (e.g., the bebionic3 hand) and shared-control strategies (see Section 4).\n\n5.5.2. Improved stimulation strategies. Biomimicry is one of the strongest trends in nerve stimulation strategies, as it promises to deliver biologically plausible stimulation patterns to evoke more natural sensations. Biomimetic approaches rely on bio-inspired models to compute the stimulation patterns, so new iterations of these models, based on the current experience in stimulation and neural recording, are needed to improve the quality of elicited sensations.\n\nThese model-based approaches permit simpler modulation strategies that increase the naturalness of sensations. T an et al. (38), for example, proved that a sinusoidal modulation of the pulse width improves the naturalness of the sensation. Formento et al. (142) instead designed a strategy to activate asynchronously stimulated fibers, mimicking healthy neural activity; in their work, they replaced classical biphasic stimulation with a high-frequency burst of pulses that slowly increased in amplitude, and confirmed their hypothesis in ex vivo experiments. Stimulation patterns that try to overcome the physical limits of present neural interfaces (as in 142) while paving the way for more natural evoked sensations also suggest the requirements for the future generation of neural interfaces and stimulators for sensory feedback: increase reaching without losing discrimination.\n\n5.5.3. New computational architectures. Neuromorphic architectures have the potential to represent a paradigm shift in the design of the control systems for bidirectional hand prostheses, going toward distributed systems and edge computing. Both sensor acquisition and stimulation can benefit from these trends because they lead to more reliable systems that scale well with the increase of sensors and stimulation active sites. If the next generation of neuromorphic hardware promotes portability and lower power consumption, it could lead to broader implementation and adoption of neuromorphic systems in bidirectional hand prostheses.\n\nMany RPHs rely on advanced encoding and decoding algorithms implemented with neural networks (62), which are more computationally demanding than traditional approaches. It is interesting that even deep learning networks can be translated into spiking neural networks (143), possibly enabling full neuromorphic hardware encoding and decoding in future prostheses.\n",
    "topic": "The implications of sensor data (joint position, forces, touch) for automatic adjustment mechanisms and shared control strategies in prosthetic hands.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the significant role of sensorization in the future development of robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs), emphasizing three main areas: embedded sensorization, improved stimulation strategies, and new computational architectures. Embedded sensorization includes sensors measuring joint position, forces, and touch, which can enable automatic adjustments (like catching slipping objects) and shared control strategies that enhance dexterity and natural interaction. The text highlights the importance of designing prostheses with integrated sensors as core functional requirements, not as add-ons. Improved stimulation strategies involve biomimetic, model-based approaches for delivering natural sensory feedback, critical for user embodiment and control. New computational architectures, such as neuromorphic systems, promise efficient, scalable, distributed control and sensory processing, supporting advanced neural network-based encoding/decoding and facilitating edge computing and portability.\n\nThe central idea linking sensor data to automatic adjustment and shared control is that continuous, reliable sensing of the prosthetic hand's state (joint positions, contact forces, tactile inputs) enables real-time adaptive behaviors and more intuitive user interaction, improving functional outcomes. This implies a shift from purely user-driven control to cooperative, sensor-informed control paradigms. The integration of sensors and neuromorphic computation can handle the complexity and volume of data for such intelligent control.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that sensor accuracy and integration quality will improve, enabling more sophisticated control, and that shared control strategies will leverage this data effectively. The text also suggests that current prostheses often lack sufficient sensorization, limiting automatic adjustments and shared control capabilities.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 due to the need for understanding prosthetic sensor integration, control theory (shared control), neural stimulation, and computational architectures.\n\nThe question should probe the understanding of how sensor data types (joint position, force, touch) underpin automatic adjustments and shared control in prosthetic hands, exploring the interplay between sensing, control strategies, and computational demands, challenging experts to synthesize these aspects beyond the text.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do the integration of joint position, force, and touch sensor data collectively enable automatic adjustment mechanisms and shared control strategies in robotic prosthetic hands, and what are the implications of this sensor fusion for the design of future computational architectures in bidirectional prostheses?\n\nA: By providing real-time feedback on hand state that allows automatic reactive behaviors and user-assistive control, sensor fusion demands computational architectures that support low-latency distributed processing and scalability to handle complex multimodal data.\n\nB: By replacing the need for user input entirely, sensor data enable fully autonomous prosthetic hand operation, which simplifies computational requirements by eliminating the need for neural network decoding.\n\nC: By primarily improving cosmetic appearance through sensor-embedded fingertips, sensor data mainly enhance user satisfaction but have minimal impact on control strategies or computational design.\n\nD: By providing redundant data streams that serve as backups in case of sensor failure, sensor fusion reduces the overall computational load by simplifying control algorithms to basic threshold triggers.\n\nExplanation: The combination of joint position, force, and touch sensors provides detailed, real-time information about the prosthetic hand's state, enabling automatic adjustments such as grip modulation to prevent object slip and facilitating shared control where both user intent and sensor feedback contribute to movement.

    "context": "## 4.4. Perspectives\nMotor decoding for RPHs is progressing in two main directions: Noninvasive approaches have seen advances in decoding algorithms using large data sets and increases in the number of recording points, and implanted electrodes (either muscular or intraneural) have seen improvements that enable better recording stability and more robust decoding. There is currently no consensus on which approach is best for transradial amputee patients, as they each have their own strengths and limitations. The need for daily signal and classification recalibration is a weak point of the classic sEMG approach, which is being addressed by several research groups developing, for example, HD-sEMG.And despite iEMG's promising control performance, which is robust to donning and doffing of the prosthesis, its overall performance gain, when compared with sEMG, may not currently be sufficient to justify an invasive surgery. The same reasoning can be applied to intraneural electrodes.\n\nOne can imagine a future where both invasive and noninvasive approaches will continue to progress and will target either patients who prefer a stable decoding setup or those who do not want to undergo surgery and will accept the need to calibrate their prosthesis on a regular basis (118). Another scenario can be a parallel development of invasive technologies for both sensory and motor functions. Indeed, as shown in Section 5, the approach using intraneural implanted electrodes has permitted unprecedented levels of somatosensory restoration; it might, therefore, be reasonable to perform a single surgery to restore both motor and sensory functions. For this reason, motor decoding using the intraneural interface can become a viable solution if these interfaces one day permit both providing sensory feedback and recording discriminative signals for motor decoding in parallel, but online artifact removal remains an important challenge.\n\nPower consumption is another critical issue: RPHs should embed small electronics because the size of the prosthesis limits the space available for batteries, but doing so usually comes at the cost of limited processing resources. Also, the electronics for the HD-sEMG remain cumbersome due to the large number of input channels and should be miniaturized and portable. Moreover, decoding model complexity is also limited by portable processing resources. In practice, an increased number of electrodes is already available in wearable systems (Sessantaquattro, OT Bioelettronica, Italy) and may become available for prostheses in the future.\n\nFinally, low latency is paramount for seamless prosthesis control [ &lt; 300 ms between user intention and real-time decoding (119)]. Among the studies discussed above, only a few performed analyses to show the feasibility of real-time control (without processing resource limitations), and even fewer included embedded electronics that would translate for home use. One possible solution for real-time decoding with complex models is to bypass embedded electronic limitations; this could be achieved by taking advantage of the computational power of cell phones or by relying on cloud computing and the next generations of wireless cellular networks for low-latency communication.\n",

This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n",

It highlights that traditional mechanical hooks, while robust, low cost, and providing proprioceptive feedback, suffer from low dexterity and poor anthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have improved aesthetics but still face mechanical inefficiency issues, requiring high input force (33 N to 131 N) to generate relatively low pinch force (15 N). This inefficiency is linked to high patient rejection rates (16%-66%). The text also introduces research efforts on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) aiming for biomimetic design with embedded actuators and sensors, but these require complex miniaturization and integration. Underactuation is a key approach to balance dexterity and complexity by reducing the number of actuators relative to degrees of freedom, enabling adaptive grip through passive joints and morphological computation.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that improving dexterity, reducing mechanical effort, and enhancing anthropomorphism are critical to user acceptance. The passage implicitly suggests that patient rejection is tied to mechanical inefficiency and control difficulty.

    "context": "## 5.3. Sensory Architectures\nTheproblem of handling many sensors at the same time has been addressed successfully in the past by using time-sharing (multiplexing) and space-sharing (matrix arrangement) techniques, minimizing wiring complexity while keeping read latency in an acceptable range. Nevertheless, this approach does not scale well in terms of covering the whole hand with a sensor density comparable to that of the human hand. Additionally, the unavoidable increase in the number of electrical connections makes the system highly susceptible to breakage.\n\nEvent-based architectures rely on the concept of send-on-delta (123), where each sensor (comprising an analog front end and an analog-to-digital converter), instead of signaling its value at a constant rate, does so only when the value changes by more than a certain threshold. These architectures have many advantages owing to the sparsity of the data representation. In other words, the communication line does not need to be capable of handling all the sensors simultaneously (as an interaction where all the sensors are triggered in the same moment is unlikely); instead, single sensors are polled at a high rate, which preserves the time structure of the stimulus.\n\nThe underlying idea of event-based systems is inspired by how neurons communicate information to each other, sending a train of spikes instead of continuous value. In earlier implementations, data flowed from sensors to the central unit through digital communication lines using well-known protocols such as Universal Asynchronous Transmitter Receiver (UART), Ethernet, and the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Some groups have designed communication paradigms by mimicking information encoding by the nerves; using pulses of 20 ns, Bartolozzi et al. (124) showed a 94% improvement in data rate over traditional protocols.\n\nAn even more advanced step was made in the work of Lee et al. (125), where the sensors communicate with spikes through the same conductive surface without any flow control, reducing the wires needed to two (data and ground). In this way, at the cost of a decoding stage for sensor value acquisition, the performance of the architecture increased, reaching up to 100,000 sensors sharing the same bus.\n",

The event-based approach, using send-on-delta, reduces data transmission load by sending data only on significant changes, which preserves temporal stimulus structure and reduces bandwidth needs.\n\nTraditional communication protocols mentioned include UART, Ethernet, and CAN bus, which were used to transmit data from sensors to a central unit. The text notes that these protocols represent earlier implementations before more specialized, neural-inspired spike communication approaches were developed. Bartolozzi et al. improved data rates by encoding information in 20 ns pulses, surpassing traditional protocols by 94%. Lee et al. further advanced this by using spike communication over a shared conductive surface with minimal wiring (two lines), enabling up to 100,000 sensors on one bus at the cost of additional decoding complexity.\n\nKey relationships and themes:\n- Traditional protocols (UART, Ethernet, CAN) represent standard methods with fixed data transmission rates and separate wiring.\n- Event-based architectures reduce data traffic by transmitting only changes, inspired by neural spike trains.\n- The trade-offs include wiring complexity, scalability, latency, and decoding complexity.\n- Neural-inspired spike communication can significantly outperform traditional protocols in data rate and scalability.\n\nThe question should probe the expert\u2019s understanding of these protocols\u2019 roles, their performance characteristics (e.g., data rate, wiring complexity, scalability), and how event-based spike communication offers superior solutions.

( a ) Noninvasive strategies include tactors targeting Meissner corpuscles and encoding pressure (4), vibrators that activate Pacinian corpuscle mechanoreceptors (129), and TENS (59), which targets the nerve noninvasively. ( ) Invasive peripheral b nervous system stimulation can be done with cuff electrodes (138) or FINEs (38, 136) that stimulate the nerve from outside the fiber. TIMEs (6, 60, 61, 64, 181) and Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays (182) are more invasive and are inserted through the nerve but stimulate directly from inside the fiber. ( ) Epidural c stimulation of the lateral spinal cord at the cervical level was able to induce tactile sensation in three upperarm amputees (140). Abbreviations: FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode. Nerve designs in panels a and b adapted with permission from Reference 42; images created with BioRender.com.\n\nElectrical stimulation is usually delivered as train pulses, of which width, amplitude, and frequency can be independently modulated and can be conveyed noninvasively through the skin; this technique is generally known as electrotactile feedback (131). Single electrotactile electrodes can be assembled in bands and arrays (132) for targeting multiple sites at the same time, encoding information in both the position and amplitude of the stimulation. The main drawbacks of electrotactile stimulation are the dependence of sensory thresholds on the stimulation position (131), which forces a calibration after each mounting, and the artifacts induced in EMG readings, which strongly impair its application in closed-loop RPHs.\n\nElectrocutaneous stimulation tries to overcome electrotactile limitations by implanting subdermally thin electrodes. Geng et al. (133) characterized the sensations evoked and highlighted improvements in the detection threshold, the threshold of noticeable differences, and the general pleasantness compared with traditional electrotactile feedback. Electrocutaneous stimulation still has technical issues in real-world implementations, such as interference with EMG readings and variability in stimulation parameters over time (134), which impair long-term applications.\n\nFeedback through neural electrodes is a promising modality that matches how sensory information is transmitted in the nervous system ( Figure 2 b ). These electrodes are implemented at both the cortical (135) and peripheral levels. Here, we focus on techniques targeting the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe three controlled parameters are the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width; the most straightforward approach is proportional modulation according to sensor readings. Studies have shown that this method can be successful even in long-term implants (114, 136-138) and confirmed the improvements brought by sensory feedback through peripheral nervous system interfaces in both performance and embodiment.\n\nCompared with noninvasive approaches, invasive neural stimulation has the advantage of being able to elicit sensations intuitive for the user, as they are delivered through the expected biological route (the peripheral nervous system) for sensory feedback. The focus in this field is currently shifting from basic feedback to evoking complex and natural sensations, feeding high-level features such as texture (61), and in general exploiting the potential of stimulating the nerves directly. Noninvasive feedback strategies are limited in the spatial precision of the evoked sensation in both mechanical and electrical stimulation (60).\n\nThe naturalness and information content of the stimulation can be improved by modulating with patterns that go beyond a simple relation with the sensor value. George et al. (139) devised two biomimetic stimulation patterns: one that is proportional to the first derivative of the force and another that is proportional to the aggregated tactile nerve response. Both approaches outperformed standard modulation techniques and were felt to be more informative by the user. Valle et al. (62) started from a model of the response to the touch of human afferent fibers and modulated frequency and amplitude according to a simulated fire rate and fiber recruitment; at the cost of a small reduction in sensitivity, the user reported a consistent increase in the naturalness of the sensation together with an increase in dexterity during functional evaluations. Both of these studies highlighted that the goal is not only to elicit precise sensations but also to focus on naturalness and intuitiveness. Neuromorphic stimulation patterns have also proven to be rich in information not only about tactile contact but also about the sliding speed and texture of an object (115).\n\nConsidering the complex surgical procedure and the effort needed to develop a peripheral nervous system interface, techniques based on spinal cord stimulation are promising, as they rely on devices that have already been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chandrasekaran et al. (140) recently demonstrated a sensory neuroprosthesis for amputee subjects with spinal cord stimulation ( Figure 2 c ). The main issue with this approach is the difficulty of eliciting natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation approaches could help address this limitation in the future.\n",
    "topic": "The advantages and limitations of electrotactile and electrocutaneous stimulation methods, especially concerning sensory threshold variability, calibration needs, EMG interference, and long-term stability.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses various methods of providing somatosensory feedback through electrical stimulation, focusing on electrotactile, electrocutaneous, and invasive neural stimulation techniques. Key points include the mechanisms of stimulation (pulse trains modulated in width, amplitude, frequency), the types of electrodes and their invasiveness, and the sensory feedback characteristics they evoke.\n\nCentral ideas:\n- Electrotactile stimulation is noninvasive but has drawbacks such as variable sensory thresholds depending on electrode placement, requiring recalibration after each use, and causing EMG artifacts that interfere with closed-loop control.\n- Electrocutaneous stimulation improves on electrotactile by implanting thin subdermal electrodes, achieving better detection thresholds and pleasantness, but still suffers from EMG interference and parameter variability over time, impairing long-term use.\n- Invasive peripheral nerve stimulation offers more natural and intuitive sensations by stimulating the nerve directly, with improved spatial precision and potential for complex biomimetic patterns enhancing naturalness and functional outcomes.\n- Spinal cord stimulation is less invasive than peripheral nerve implants but struggles to elicit natural sensations; biomimetic stimulation may help here.\n\nSubtle details:\n- The sensory threshold variability in electrotactile stimulation is positional, necessitating recalibration after each mounting.\n- Electrocutaneous stimulation reduces detection thresholds and improves pleasantness but is still limited by EMG artifacts and stability issues.\n- Peripheral nerve stimulation can modulate multiple parameters and use biomimetic patterns to encode tactile features such as texture and dynamic contact properties, enhancing embodiment and dexterity.\n- The complexity and invasiveness of peripheral nerve implants contrast with the noninvasive but less precise and less natural sensations of electrotactile and electrocutaneous methods.\n- The trade-off between invasiveness, stability, naturalness, and EMG interference is a core theme.\n\nImplicit assumptions and applications:\n- That sensory feedback must be both stable and natural for effective neuroprosthetic function.\n- Calibration difficulty and EMG interference are major practical barriers for noninvasive approaches.\n- Biomimetic stimulation patterns represent an advanced approach to improve naturalness beyond simple proportional encoding.\n- Long-term stability is critical for clinical applications.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. The question should probe understanding of the nuanced trade-offs between electrotactile and electrocutaneous stimulation methods in terms of sensory threshold variability, calibration, EMG interference, and long-term stability, as well as implications for practical neuroprosthetic use.\n\nIntentional question planning:\nA highly challenging question would require the expert to integrate knowledge of the mechanisms of electrotactile and electrocutaneous stimulation, their limitations (especially sensory threshold variability and EMG interference), and the implications these have for calibration and long-term use. This would encourage reflection on why these limitations arise and how they constrain application, and contrast with invasive methods. The question should avoid obvious facts and instead focus on the interplay of these factors and their clinical significance.\n\nThe question will focus on the core limitation of electrotactile stimulation related to sensory threshold variability and EMG interference, and how electrocutaneous stimulation addresses these but still has unresolved issues, probing deep understanding of these subtleties.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Which fundamental limitation of electrotactile stimulation necessitates recalibration after each application, and how does electrocutaneous stimulation attempt to overcome this, despite still facing challenges with EMG interference and long-term parameter variability?\n\nA: Electrotactile stimulation\u2019s dependence on stimulation position causes sensory threshold variability requiring recalibration; electrocutaneous stimulation overcomes this by implanting subdermal electrodes to stabilize thresholds but still suffers from EMG artifacts and parameter drift over time.\n\nB: Electrotactile stimulation\u2019s inability to modulate pulse frequency causes inconsistent sensations requiring recalibration; electrocutaneous stimulation resolves this by fixed-frequency pulses but remains limited by poor spatial resolution.\n\nC: Electrotactile stimulation\u2019s invasive nature causes tissue damage necessitating recalibration; electrocutaneous stimulation uses noninvasive surface electrodes to avoid this but cannot provide natural sensations.\n\nD: Electrotactile stimulation\u2019s high power consumption leads to unstable stimulation intensities needing recalibration; electrocutaneous stimulation reduces power use but introduces latency in feedback.\n\nExplanation: Electrotactile stimulation\u2019s sensory thresholds vary with electrode position on the skin, forcing calibration after each mounting. Electrocutaneous stimulation implants subdermal electrodes to achieve more stable detection thresholds and improved pleasantness, but it still encounters EMG interference and variability in stimulation parameters over time, limiting long-term application.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",

When an individual interacts with surrounding objects, tactile sensations are used to infer features such as size, compliance, temperature, and texture, while the same sensations are exploited to handle them properly or use them as tools. From this perspective, aiming to restore afferent sensory channels from a hand prosthesis is a critical step in designing a device that ensures two key aspects: dexterous manipulation and embodiment of the prosthetic device.\n\nThe design of a sensory feedback system that can successfully deliver information relies on three fundamental blocks working together: ( a ) sensor readings, processed by ( ) an encoding b strategy capable of translating meaningful information to the user, through ( ) an interface. Prec vious sections have described the different available interfaces; here, we present the encoding techniques and sensors relevant to the design of modern hand prostheses ( Table 1 ).\n\nSensors mounted on a robotic hand should ideally record the whole spectrum of available human sensations, from both external and internal sources. Indeed, sensory information from the human hand covers both interactions with the external world (tactile perception, thermal perception, and nociception, i.e., perception of pain) and internal perception of the positions of the joints and the length and forces exerted by the muscles, together known as proprioception. Table 2 shows examples of sensor placements on RPHs from recent studies.\n",

The text stresses the ideal goal of capturing the full spectrum of human hand sensations, which includes external sensory modalities (tactile, thermal, nociceptive) and internal modalities (proprioception related to joint position and muscle forces). It also notes that modern prosthetic hands use sensors placed to capture these various sensory inputs, illustrating the complexity of achieving comprehensive sensory restoration.\n\nImplicit in this is the challenge of integrating diverse sensor types to capture multiple sensory modalities, the complexity of encoding and translating these signals meaningfully to users, and interfacing them with the nervous system or other feedback pathways.

    "context": "## 4. MOTOR CONTROL\nDespite the advances in techniques for voluntary motor decoding and the increased sophistication of the available RPHs, body-powered prostheses are still the most robust control approach. The mechanism of these devices is based on a cable actuated by movements of the shoulder to control one DOF. The vast majority of commercially available RPHs use simple threshold-based sEMG decoding over a few surface electrodes and also generally control one DOF (66); in some cases, the RPH provides more DOFs, but this comes at the cost of a nonintuitive command scheme. These systems also offer no possibility to control several DOFs at the same time. The current situation is, therefore, increasingly sophisticated RPH mechanics with unchanged control strategies. As such, patients often abandon myoelectric prostheses, in part because the small functional improvement does not justify their price and complexity (13, 67).\n\nHere, we describe recent advances in control strategies in terms of decoding type (classification or continuous control) and functional achievement (e.g., number of DOFs, grasping, or single-finger decoding) and compare them with the classical direct control approach. Section 4.1 details different algorithmic approaches to decode motor functions, with an emphasis on sEMG; Section 4.2 discusses the addition of robotic automation to improve grasp robustness; Section 4.3 compares implanted methods to extract the user's intentions; and finally, Section 4.4 presents a perspective on the broader adoption of these techniques by patients.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context focuses on motor control in robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs), emphasizing the contrast between traditional body-powered prostheses and advanced myoelectric control systems. It highlights that despite mechanical improvements in RPHs, control strategies remain limited, often simplistic (threshold-based sEMG decoding), controlling only one degree of freedom (DOF) at a time, and resulting in nonintuitive command schemes when multiple DOFs are available. This limitation contributes to patient abandonment of myoelectric prostheses due to insufficient functional benefits relative to their complexity and cost. The passage sets the stage for discussing recent advances in decoding motor functions (classification vs. continuous control), robotic automation to improve grasp robustness, implanted intention extraction methods, and user adoption. The key theme is the integration of robotic automation as a compensatory mechanism to address the inherent limitations of user-driven control in prosthetic devices, aiming to enhance grasp robustness and functional outcome.\n\nImplicitly, the text assumes that user voluntary control alone is insufficient for complex, simultaneous multi-DOF prosthetic manipulation and that robotic automation can bridge this gap.

The challenge is to balance user intention decoding with automated assistance to optimize function and user satisfaction.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

    "context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",

    "question": "In the context of decoding single-finger and multi-finger movements for prosthetic hand control, how does the integration of high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) with deep learning-based feature learning fundamentally address the limitations of traditional classification approaches, and what are the primary challenges that still constrain this integration in practical clinical applications?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "HD-sEMG with deep learning improves robustness to electrode shifts and enables simultaneous proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom, but requires extensive labeled datasets and anatomical expertise for electrode placement.",
      "B": "HD-sEMG with deep learning reduces the need for electrode placement precision and data volume by using hand-crafted features, yet lacks the capability for single-finger movement classification.",
      "C": "HD-sEMG combined with traditional threshold-based control allows intuitive direct control of grasps with minimal training but suffers from low dexterity and poor robustness to signal variability.",
      "D": "HD-sEMG with deep learning eliminates the need for any training data through unsupervised learning and fully automates electrode placement, but cannot decode proportional finger movements."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The integration of HD-sEMG provides high spatial resolution signals less sensitive to electrode placement shifts, which when combined with deep learning's ability to learn features directly from raw data, surpasses traditional hand-crafted feature classification methods in accuracy and robustness. However, this approach demands large labeled datasets for training, which are difficult to obtain in clinical settings, and precise anatomical knowledge for electrode placement remains a challenge. Domain adaptation techniques help mitigate data scarcity, but practical issues like signal non-stationarity over time persist.",

    "topic": "The importance of closed-loop control systems combining motor command decoding and sensory feedback for enhanced prosthetic hand dexterity.",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context consists almost entirely of a comprehensive reference list from a scholarly review related to robotic and prosthetic hands, their control, sensory feedback, neural interfacing, and evaluation methods. Among these references, several key themes emerge relevant to the question topic: the importance of closed-loop control systems integrating motor command decoding and sensory feedback to improve prosthetic hand dexterity.\n\nNotably, references such as Raspopovic et al. (2014) on restoring natural sensory feedback in bidirectional prostheses, Valle et al. (2018, 2020) on biomimetic intraneural sensory feedback enhancing dexterity, and D'Anna et al. (2019) on closed-loop hand prostheses with simultaneous tactile and position feedback highlight the critical role of bidirectional neural interfaces. Additional references discuss advanced myoelectric control (Farina et al., 2014; Muceli & Farina, 2012), neural decoding (Cracchiolo et al., 2020), and sensory feedback techniques (Antfolk et al., 2013; Dosen et al., 2017). This body of work illustrates that combining accurate motor command decoding with real-time, biomimetic sensory feedback in closed-loop architectures significantly enhances prosthetic hand function, embodiment, and user dexterity.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that motor decoding alone is insufficient for naturalistic prosthesis control and that sensory feedback is essential to improve manipulation accuracy and embodiment. Subtle details include the types of sensory feedback (intraneural, vibrotactile, electrotactile), the challenges of neural interface stability, and the importance of asynchronous stochastic neural stimulation for natural perception.\n\nThe question difficulty is rated 9 out of 10 because it requires expert-level knowledge of neuroprosthetics, neural interfacing, sensorimotor integration, and prosthetic control systems. The question should prompt reflection on why closed-loop control (motor command decoding plus sensory feedback) is superior to open-loop control and how this integration impacts prosthetic hand dexterity, considering neural and biomechanical factors.\n\nThe question is intentionally designed to require synthesis of neuroengineering principles, neural control theory, and prosthetic design insights, challenging experts to articulate the mechanistic and functional benefits of closed-loop systems beyond simple motor command decoding.\n\nNo irrelevant or bogus information is present; the content is highly relevant and scholarly.\n\nHence, a single challenging multiple-choice question probing the critical role of closed-loop control systems in prosthetic hand dexterity will be generated.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Why does integrating both motor command decoding and sensory feedback in a closed-loop control system fundamentally enhance the dexterity of prosthetic hands compared to motor command decoding alone?\n\nA: Because sensory feedback enables the prosthesis to autonomously correct its motor commands without user intervention.\n\nB: Because sensory feedback provides real-time afferent information that allows the user to adjust motor output, resulting in more precise and natural manipulation.\n\nC: Because motor command decoding alone provides sufficient control, and sensory feedback mainly improves cosmetic appearance.\n\nD: Because sensory feedback replaces the need for motor command decoding by directly controlling prosthetic movements through reflexes.\n\nExplanation: Integrating sensory feedback in closed-loop prosthetic control provides the user with real-time tactile and proprioceptive information, enabling conscious adjustment of motor commands, which enhances precision and naturalness of hand movements; motor decoding alone lacks this afferent information, limiting dexterity.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

Merkel disks and Ruffini capsules are slow-adapting receptors, meaning that they fire continuously during tactile stimuli, with a firing rate related to the pressure applied in their receptive field.

The provided information, although somewhat fragmented, highlights the biological basis for sensory feedback (different mechanoreceptors) and technological means (percutaneous leads) for interfacing prosthetics with the nervous system.

    "context": "## Transradial amputation:\nThe cosmetic solution is often used for the most distal amputations (e.g., fingers) but is not adapted for patients with a transradial amputation given the dramatic loss of functionality. Bodypowered mechanical hooks, mainly with one-DOF control, are popular solutions thanks to their the partial amputation of the arm below the elbow, at some point along the radial bone\n\nb\n\ne\n\nBattery pack\n\nc\n\nCoil (integrates with prosthetic frame)\n\nCable\n\n(for power and data transmission)\n\nCoil driver module\n\nProsthetic hand\n\nProsthetic control interface\n\nf\n\nBiomimetic: imitating natural processes in order to improve a technical solution\n\nlow price, light weight, and easy maintenance. This type of prosthesis is also well suited for highintensity work due to the control robustness. Also, because the subject must move their shoulder to open and close the hook, these systems have inherent proprioception feedback (9). However, one of the major limitations of the hook solution is the low level of dexterity and nonanthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands have solved the anthropomorphic aspect while keeping the robustness of body-powered solutions (10). For example, Baril et al. (11) developed a programmable body-powered hand that can perform different grasp types using a mechanical selector that blocks the closing of one or more fingers. Nevertheless, this solution has its drawback as well: Because of their low mechanical efficiency, body-powered prostheses require large amounts of energy (from 33 N for a hook to 131 N for a hand) to produce a relatively low pinch force (15 N) (12). This could explain their high rejection rate by patients, which ranges between 16% and 66% depending on the survey and time period (13).\n\nHere, we concentrate on RPHs because they potentially offer the most versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacement for amputated hands and could become the default solution for patients. We investigate the challenges in existing RPHs, considering both commercially available solutions ( Supplemental Table 1 ) and those in the research phase ( Supplemental Table 2 ).\n\nMimicking the biomechanics of a hand is not easy. Early prototypes (14) succeeded in designing fingers with skeleton-like structures, but biomimetic actuation was only recently properly implemented using muscle-like actuators (15). The challenge for RPH developers is to embed actuators, sensors, and electronic components into a prosthesis with the same size and weight as the replaced hand (14, 16, 17). Major system integration and miniaturization are necessary before these systems can be used by amputee patients.\n\nInstead, underactuation is a widespread approach to simplify the mechanics while keeping reasonable dexterity. An underactuated system is one where the number of degrees of actuation (DOAs) is smaller than the number of DOFs (see DOA/DOF &lt; 1 in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 ). The passive (nonactuated) DOFs are exploited to adapt to the surface in contact, as suggested by the concept of morphological computation (18), and to enable a self-adjusting grip without the need to control each articulation. These systems reduce the number of motors needed in the RPH and therefore its complexity, weight, and price.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context compares three types of prosthetic solutions for transradial amputations: body-powered mechanical hooks, body-powered hands, and robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs). It highlights the trade-offs between these systems in terms of dexterity, mechanical efficiency, energy requirements, anthropomorphism, robustness, and user acceptance. Body-powered hooks are mechanically simple, robust, inexpensive, and provide proprioceptive feedback due to direct shoulder movement control, but have low dexterity and a non-anthropomorphic appearance. Body-powered hands improve anthropomorphism and preserve robustness but suffer from low mechanical efficiency requiring high input force (33 N for hooks to 131 N for hands) to generate relatively low pinch force (~15 N), contributing to high rejection rates.\n\nRobotic prosthetic hands aim to offer versatile, natural, and power-efficient replacements, incorporating biomimetic designs and underactuated mechanisms to balance dexterity with reduced complexity, weight, and cost. Underactuation allows fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, exploiting passive DOFs for adaptive gripping, thus improving efficiency and user control. The context also notes the technical challenges of miniaturizing actuators, sensors, and electronics to match the size and weight of natural hands.\n\nThe main nuanced theme is the balance between mechanical efficiency, dexterity, energy requirements, robustness, and user acceptance across these prosthetic types. The implication is that despite the sophistication of robotic hands, body-powered devices still have merits in robustness and proprioception, but their energy inefficiency and rejection rates limit their utility. The underactuation approach in robotic hands is a critical innovation to overcome these trade-offs.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 due to the need to integrate biomechanical, mechanical engineering, and user acceptance factors into a comparative understanding.\n\nThe question should challenge experts to analyze the differences in mechanical efficiency and energy requirements among these prosthetic types, linking them to design trade-offs, and implications for patient use and rejection rates.

    "context": "## 4.1. Decoding Algorithms\nThe clinical standard for RPH control is based on the use of two sEMG channels, with the electrodes placed superficially on antagonist muscles. The envelope of the signal is extracted so that the user can control the closing and opening of the RPH by modulating the amplitude of their muscle contraction. When the amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, the RPH will move depending on which muscle was activated. Companies are offering more DOFs, using cocontraction to\n\ncycle through different types of grasps (e.g., Ottobock's Michelangelo hand). However, this type of control is highly nonintuitive and gives only low dexterity to the user. An alternative to this direct control approach is based on pattern recognition methods, extracting hand-crafted features to characterize the signal in a discriminative way (e.g., the signal root mean square, wavelength, and zero crossing) and classify the type of grasp intended by the user. This solution has become robust enough to reach the market (the Coapt system and Ottobock's Myo Plus). Using 2-12 bipolar sEMG electrodes makes it possible to obtain good classification rates for different kinds of grasps, with 90-95% accuracy for 4-12 classes and up to 75% for 50 classes (68-72).\n\nUsing a similar electrode disposition and classification method, other groups showed the possibility of decoding single-finger movement using the classification of flexion or extension (73, 74). Recently, Bhagwat &amp; Mukherji (75) showed single- and multifinger classification of 15 different movements with 99.79% accuracy. Researchers are also working on proportional control instead of classification, which makes it possible to decode several DOFs (e.g., wrist and finger movements) simultaneously and proportionally (76, 77). This type of control offers continuous position control. Several studies have also shown that single-finger proportional control is feasible, with good results (78, 79).\n\nAs an alternative, nonbiomimetic EMG decoders have been developed that rely on the subject learning inverse maps to relate motor outputs to arbitrary control variables (80). Using an abstract decoding cursor control space, subjects can learn to modulate their EMG activity to reach different targets arranged in a center-out task in order to trigger various grasping movements (81). Dyson et al. (82) recently validated these results on amputee participants; they showed that after training, the difficulty of the tasks could be increased, improving the possibilities for robotic hand control.\n\nWith only a few electrodes placed on muscles of interest, the accurate positioning of the electrodes requires anatomical knowledge; indeed, the type of amputation (congenital or traumatic), the surgical procedure, and the time since amputation (83) could influence the muscle anatomy and make the placement of the electrode tedious and specific to individual subjects. Moreover, a small shift in electrode placement can disrupt the pattern recognition algorithm (84). T o tackle these issues, several authors have proposed HD-sEMG, which consists of a grid of closely spaced electrodes, as an alternative solution. The large number of electrodes allows information to be recorded from a large part of the subject's forearm.\n\nHD-sEMG signals offer high spatial resolution, and recorded signals can be interpreted as spatial images of EMG activity. Using this image representation of EMG data, HD-sEMG is robust to small electrode shifts (85). Boschmann &amp; Platzner (85) used a structural similarity index, borrowed from the computer vision field, on HD-sEMG images combined with a simple one-against-one nearest-neighbor classifier to decode wrist and hand motions. Similarly, Stango et al. (86) used a variogram of images (a measure of the degree of spatial correlation, used mainly in geostatistics) to classify wrist movements. Both groups showed that their methods, which use spatial information from the images, performed better or similarly to the classic feature extraction approach. Moreover, their strategies improved the robustness to electrode shift and electrode number. The use of several spatially close electrodes makes it possible to decompose the EMG signal into its constituent motor unit action potential (50, 87). Kapelner et al. (88) investigated this approach, decomposing EMG signals to extract motor unit activity from forearm muscles during wrist motions. Recently, Dai &amp; Hu (89) showed that an approach consisting of finger joint angle estimation, combining classification for finger selection with EMG decomposition into motor unit activity, outperforms a standard amplitude-based approach.\n\nWe observe a paradigm shift from feature engineering to feature learning using raw data as input for deep neural networks. Studies have shown that combining this deep learning approach with HD-sEMG offers better performance than hand-crafted features in both grasp classification\n\n(90) and simultaneous single-finger and wrist movement classification (91). Deep learning has also shown good results with a smaller number of electrodes for grasp classification (72) and regression of arm or wrist motions (92, 93).\n\nThis approach permits both high dexterity and robustness, with unprecedented performance. However,one of the major difficulties of the deep learning approach is that it requires an extensive data set for training. For example, the deep learning used for the ImageNet challenge in 2012 used 1.2 million images for training on 1,000 categories (94). In the context of hand gesture recognition, generating tens of thousands of examples for a subject is not a viable option.\n\nA possible solution could use domain adaptation [often called transfer learning in the EMG literature (95, 96)], by leveraging data acquired from several subjects to enhance and accelerate training for a new user. Indeed, the aim is to use information from a database of several source domains and adapt it to a target domain (the end user) with a small number of samples. Authors generally apply deep domain adaptation (domain adaptation combined with deep learning) by pretraining a deep neural network and fine-tuning it with a few repetitions of movements by a target subject. The main idea is that gathering the recordings of several participants can meet the necessary conditions to learn a general mapping of all users' sEMG signals.\n\nUsing this idea, C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al. (97) showed that their deep model was able to learn the features and significantly enhance the performance of deep networks on out-of-sample gestures. Using HD-sEMG and deep learning, Du et al. (98) also showed an unsupervised deep domain adaptation method that incrementally learns from data during a new session without explicit calibration of gestures. Consequently, deep learning offers a particularly attractive context from which to develop deep domain adaptation algorithms to leverage interuser data. This approach can increase decoding performance, improve robustness to electrode shift, and reduce the number of repetitions needed during training (99).\n\nAs seen in this section, the search for new EMG decoding algorithms that go beyond thresholdbased detection is an active field of research. Phinyomark &amp; Scheme (100) and Khamparia &amp; Singh (101) have reviewed recent research in EMG pattern recognition methods.\n\nMachine learning in the field of computer vision and object recognition has shown outstanding results using deep learning and is already used commercially by many companies. Some deep learning algorithms based on a pretrained network are now usable without any fine-tuning (e.g., self-driving cars). However, bio-signals are intrinsically different from images and need adaptation. More important, the amount of labeled EMG data available to effectively train deep networks might not be sufficient to capture the evolution of the signal over time (electrode displacement, skin impedance changes, etc.). Therefore, if model architectures and data processing are tailored for bio-signal applications and take into consideration signal evolution with time, deep learning can become a solution for more robust motor intention decoding.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses advanced decoding algorithms for high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) applied to robotic prosthetic hand (RPH) control, focusing on spatial image representations of EMG signals. It contrasts traditional low-DOF threshold control and hand-crafted feature pattern recognition with newer methods leveraging HD-sEMG grids that produce spatially rich EMG images. Two key spatial image-based metrics are highlighted: the structural similarity index (from computer vision) and variograms (from geostatistics), both used to exploit spatial correlations in HD-sEMG data to improve classification of wrist and hand motions. These methods improve robustness to electrode shifts and reduce dependency on precise electrode placement. The text also notes the paradigm shift towards deep learning that automatically learns features from raw HD-sEMG data, further enhancing classification performance and robustness, though requiring large datasets and domain adaptation for practical use. The key conceptual link is how spatial image-based representations capture richer, spatially correlated information from HD-sEMG signals, allowing more accurate and robust decoding than classical amplitude or feature-based approaches.\n\nThis analysis identifies:\n- The importance of spatial representations (structural similarity and variograms) in capturing EMG spatial correlations.\n- Their demonstrated improvements in robustness and classification performance.\n- The transition from engineered features to learned features in deep learning applied to HD-sEMG.\n- Challenges such as electrode placement variability and data requirements, and strategies like domain adaptation.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. The question should probe the candidate\u2019s understanding of how spatial image metrics fundamentally enhance classification beyond classical features, the implications for robustness and generalization, and the relationship to electrode placement and deep learning strategies.\n\nThe question will invite reflection on the theoretical and practical advantages of spatial image representations in HD-sEMG decoding, connecting signal processing, spatial statistics, and machine learning domains.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do spatial image representations of HD-sEMG signals, such as the structural similarity index and variograms, fundamentally enhance the robustness and classification performance of hand and wrist movement decoding compared to classical feature-based methods, particularly in relation to electrode shift and spatial correlation in the signal?\n\nA: By encoding temporal frequency components of EMG signals, they increase sensitivity to muscle fatigue variations, which improves classification.\n\nB: By capturing spatial correlations and patterns across densely spaced electrodes, they provide robustness to electrode placement variability and exploit rich spatial information unavailable to single-channel amplitude features.\n\nC: By reducing the dimensionality of EMG data through averaging across electrodes, they simplify the classification problem and minimize overfitting.\n\nD: By focusing solely on amplitude thresholds in antagonist muscles, they ensure intuitive and direct control of prosthetic hand movements with minimal training.\n\nExplanation: Spatial image representations like structural similarity indices and variograms analyze the spatial distribution and correlations of EMG activity across multiple closely spaced electrodes in HD-sEMG grids. This approach leverages spatial patterns that remain consistent despite small electrode shifts, unlike classical single-channel amplitude features that are sensitive to electrode placement. Consequently, these spatial metrics improve classification accuracy and robustness by effectively encoding richer spatial information inherent in muscle activation patterns.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

    "context": "## 4.2. Shared Control to Help Motor Decoding\nThe ultimate goal of RPH control is to be as close as possible to controlling a natural hand. Therefore, an ideal control needs to be intuitive and continuous over individual fingers and wrist movements. Increasing the number of DOFs and developing proportional control will increase dexterity for prosthesis users but will inevitably reduce the overall robustness of the decoder. Since reliability is one of the main factors for upper-limb prosthesis users (102), this is a significant issue for the commercialization of more dexterous control schemes.\n\nOne possible solution to improve decoding robustness is to add robotic automation of some portion of the motor command. Shared-control strategies between a subject and a smart robotic hand have been reported for automated preshaping and grasping (103), grip force adjustment\n\n(104), slip detection, and hand closing (105). In the context of single-finger proportional control, Zhuang et al. (79) proposed a shared-control strategy to increase grasp robustness (avoiding accidental drops), by maximizing the number of contacts between the RPH and an object while allowing the user to maintain full autonomy over decisions about grasping and releasing, grasp preshaping, and non-grasp-related motions. These strategies allow both freedom during singlefinger control and robustness during a grasp event (79) and can perform more dexterous movements that cannot be decoded based on EMG alone. However, they necessitate many DOAs (e.g., active control of each phalanx to reposition the fingers around an object), which is still a significant challenge in terms of motor miniaturization, power consumption, and cost.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses shared-control strategies in robotic prosthetic hand (RPH) operation, emphasizing the challenge of balancing dexterity with robustness in motor decoding. Increasing degrees of freedom (DOFs) and proportional control enhances dexterity but reduces decoder reliability, which is critical for user acceptance. Shared-control integrates user motor commands with robotic automation to improve robustness without sacrificing user autonomy. Examples include automated preshaping, grip force adjustment, slip detection, and grasp stabilization by maximizing contact points. The approach enables dexterous movements beyond EMG decoding capabilities alone but requires many degrees of actuation (DOAs), presenting technical challenges in miniaturization, power, and cost.\n\nThis topic is complex because it involves understanding neural control interfaces, robotics, biomechanics, and the trade-offs between autonomy and automation in assistive devices.

    "context": "## 2.2. Perspectives\nWhile rigid architectures are still the norm, there has been recent interest in the development of flexible systems that inherently permit safe robot-human interaction (29). Instead of using a rigid structure with mechanical joints, the compliant structures in soft designs enable them to bend continuously in any part. Since seminal work by Hirose &amp; Ma (30), there have been several attempts to develop soft underactuated hand prostheses (31) and soft body-powered devices (9). These architectures combine the advantages of simple actuation with the performance of an adaptable hand. Recent studies have proved that soft manipulators could match the performance of rigid systems in many applications (32). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether soft architectures are viable solutions for larger use.\n\nInnovative actuation systems such as McKibben pneumatic muscles, granular jamming (33), and electro-conjugate fluid (34), which are strongly tied to soft robotic devices, are another interesting direction. Soft RPHs have the advantage of exploiting the structure to embed and eventually improve sensorization, safety, and efficiency (e.g., 35). These systems are at the early stage and need massive integration before being deployed in portable devices.\n\nTable 1 Maturity levels of different technologies\n\n| Technology       | Most widespread                 | Mature, home use                                                                                | Cutting edge, laboratory use                                                                                            | Future directions                                                                                                         |\n\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n| Interface        | Body harness c                  | sEMG a iEMG (51) a Vibrotactile interface (178) b TENS b FINEs (136) b Osseointegration (138) c | HD-sEMG (179) a Regenerative electrodes (39) a TIMEs (6, 42) b LIFEs (43) b Sieve electrodes (180) b Utah Array (113) c | Noninvasive intraneural stimulation (ultrasound) b Soft neurotechnology (48) b                                            |\n\n| Motor decoding   | Body power Threshold-based sEMG | EMG-based pattern recognition (e.g., Ottobock Myo Plus, Coapt Gen2)                             | Simultaneous single-finger classification (75) Linear regression and shared control (79)                                | Advanced control using regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces (39) Deep learning for single-finger proportional control |\n\n| Sensory feedback | No feedback                     | Vibrotactile haptic feedback (129) Touch contact (138) Position (136)                           | Neuromorphic (62) Texture (61) Object stiffness (6) Multimodal (position and tactile) (64) Biomimetic stimulation (62)  | Temperature feedback Proprioception                                                                                       |\n\n| Sensorization    | No skin                         | Force sensors (measuring motor current) Sensorized fingertips (e.g., bebionic)                  | Asynchronously coded electronic skin (125)                                                                              | Soft embedded sensors (115) Bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve (122)                                  |\n\nAbbreviations: EMG, electromyography; FINE, flat interface nerve electrode; HD-sEMG, high-density surface electromyography; iEMG, implanted EMG; LIFE, longitudinal intrafascicular electrode; sEMG, surface electromyography; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIME; transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode.\n\na Motor interface.\n\nb Sensory interface.\n\nc Both motor and sensory interface.\n",

    "context": "## 2.1. Existing Robotic Prosthetic Hands\nNumerous commercially available RPH solutions use underactuated mechanisms ( Supplemental Table 1 ), including the Michelangelo prosthetic hand (Ottobock, Germany), the i-Limb Ultra (\u00d6ssur, Iceland), the bebionic hand (Ottobock), and the VINCENT evolution 3 (Vincent Systems, Germany). Despite remarkable advances, there is still arguably a trade-off between dexterity and weight in these solutions, with companies usually emphasizing one aspect or the other.\n\nMany research groups are currently working on innovative solutions to tackle the dexterity/ weight dilemma (19), such as the use of a monolithic 3D-printed soft material (20) or mechanical solutions to implement finger synergies via clutches (21). For example, Jing et al. (19) proposed an anthropomorphic RPH using only three motors that could achieve 13 grasp types while weighing only approximately 130 g.\n\nThe price of RPHs is an additional limiting factor for broader adoption by patients. With most advanced solutions costing $10,000-20,000, many researchers advocate for cheaper solutions, particularly for emerging countries (e.g., 22).\n\nOpen source RPHs are an exciting alternative to dramatically reduce the cost of development and distribution. One particularly interesting aspect of such hands is simplified maintenance and repairs (using, e.g., 3D printing) that do not rely on specific suppliers. For example, Open\n\nBionics (United Kingdom) commercializes solutions for transradial amputees (e.g., the medically certified Hero Arm) but also provides the source files for some of their designs, and e-NABLE ( https://enablingthefuture.org ) reports 8,000 recipients of their prosthetics, which were built by volunteers around the world. Open source RPHs also enable users to alter the design to meet their unique needs; for example, the Galileo Hand (23) allows easy customization of the types of movements and number of electromyography (EMG) electrodes.\n\nResearchers are also working on better mechanical solutions to improve RPH dexterity. An underactuated hand prosthesis designed by Abayasiri et al. (24) has finger abduction and adduction to enable it to grasp larger objects, and an adaptive prosthetic hand designed by Yong et al. (25) adds DOFs in the palm with movable metacarpals. The Karlsruhe Institute of T echnology (KIT) prosthetic hand (26) has an embedded camera and real-time object recognition, enabling the hand to be preshaped. Pneumatic artificial muscle (27) permits the development of light, compact solutions. Finally, biomimetic actuation is used for muscle-like actuators (15).\n\nIn addition to the hardware aspect, there are also innovations in RPH control and sensorization. Low-level controllers use information about the state of the device and eventually activate the actuation to meet the desired state imposed by the user's intentions. The choice of the state variable has a strong influence on how the device works. Position or speed can be read through encoders of each joint and controlled; these are straightforward approaches that have been used broadly in robotic applications. When the interaction of the hand with the external environment is of interest, more advanced control systems are implemented, such as torque or impedance control. Both approaches measure the force applied by the actuator, controlling it directly in the first case and simulating compliance in the second. Advanced control strategies enable complex manipulation and smoother gestures at the expense of a bulkier mechanical structure and a more complex control system. Therefore, enabling more sophisticated control requires integrated force and position sensors, which have been previously developed mainly to close the robotic control loop (28).\n\nIn summary, low-cost and light hands have flourished over the last few years. The race to simplify designs and reduce costs through 3D printing should not impact the dexterity of RPHs. For now, underactuated mechanisms are the best solution for RPHs and innovative designs based on synergy mechanisms or friction, the latter of which can help increase the number of DOAs without increasing the number of motors.\n",

    "context": "## 4.3. Decoding Motor Intention via Implanted Electrodes\nSurface electrodes cannot precisely record the signal from deep muscles; to overcome this issue, several groups have focused on iEMG electrodes. This technique is more invasive but allows one to record EMG signals (51) uncorrelated from the underlying musculature and avoids the daily placement of electrodes. iEMG is robust against electrode shift (e.g., socket rotation) and change in skin impedance and sweat. Several studies have demonstrated the performance of simultaneous wrist and hand motions (three DOFs) using six to eight iEMG electrodes; Smith &amp; Hargrove (51) showed that iEMG has better decoding performance than sEMG. High decoding performance is reported in real time (106), and in fully implanted setups, the results are stable for several days (107).\n\nOnthe other hand, Farrell &amp; Weir (52) compared the pattern recognition-based grasp classification performance of iEMG and sEMG on 12 movement classes with eight channels and did not find a statistical difference between electrode types. They concluded that the choice of electrode should be based not on classification accuracy but rather on signal consistency over time and robustness to electrode lift-off. Zia ur Rehman et al. (108) compared a standard linear discriminant analysis with a deep network for grasp classification. They performed a multiday analysis comparing six iEMG and six sEMG electrodes, and their results showed that deep learning had better decoding performance and was more stable over time.\n\nKamavuako et al. (109) investigated the effect of combining iEMG to target deep muscles with sEMG on myoelectric control. They showed that the combined solution improved offline and real-time control performance compared with sEMG alone.\n\nWith 32 iEMG electrodes, Dantas et al. (110) compared different decoding methods for the continuous control of five DOFs corresponding to the flexion and extension of each digit. Using a data set aggregation algorithm, they showed a normalized mean squared error as low as 0.033 with a deep convolutional neural network. They also investigated signal stability for 150 days after training, showing a small degradation during the first month (0.003 normalized mean squared error per day with a convolutional neural network), but that degradation stopped in the next four months.\n\nFor transradial amputees, an alternative to using EMG signals to control hand prostheses is decoding from peripheral nerve signals. Different grasp types can be decoded from peripheral nerve signals with high accuracy using different interfaces, both offline and in real time (54, 111113). Implanted peripheral nerve recordings are more invasive than sEMG but are more stable over time. Indeed, donning and doffing the prosthesis does not move these electrodes as much as it does sEMG electrodes. Recently, Cracchiolo et al. (53) decoded up to 11 class states using TIMEs on an amputee subject and showed that the active sites chosen on the first day could also be used in the following sessions, for up to seven days (80% accuracy, compared with 83% by selecting active sites every session). However, this modality is generally used to provide sensory\n\nfeedback (64, 114-116). Therefore the development of new approaches to record neural signals during peripheral stimulation [e.g., artifact removal (117)] is necessary.\n\nVu et al. (39) recently developed a regenerative peripheral nerve interface to increase signal specificity and long-term stability. They implanted transected peripheral nerves into a free muscle graft. After regeneration, revascularization, and reinnervation, the graft becomes a nerve bioamplifier that creates EMG signals. Using chronically implanted iEMG to record from these grafts, they performed five-class decoding in real time with up to 98.2% accuracy with two transradial amputees in a virtual hand environment. They also showed results from a Box and Block T est using an RPH that provided continuous control of two DOFs of thumb motions through their interface combined with a third DOF based on sEMG.\n",

    "context": "## 6. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT\nGiven the increasing complexity of RPHs that integrate both sensory and motor functionalities, it is important to have standardized tools to measure the efficacy of novel technologies (144). While designing custom experiments to evaluate a technology might be tempting, there is a crucial need for well-established assessment tools to enable comparisons of different approaches on a common basis.\n\nCaregivers should assess how a technology solves patients' impairments (their body structures or functions), activity limitations (e.g., by improving their ability to grasp), and participation\n\n\n## Biphasic:\ncharacterized by a two-phase, bidirectional wave with one positive phase and one negative phase\n\nNeuromorphic system: a software or hardware implementation that mimics the nervous system in terms of computation and transmission of information\n\nrestrictions (e.g., by allowing them to participate in a sport). In addition, the impairment should be viewed not only from a biological perspective but also in terms of its psychosocial consequences; an effective RPH should promote autonomy and support the reintegration of the individual into society. The measurement of patients' health-related quality of life has now become a norm during the rehabilitation process (145). For example, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Head (DASH) questionnaire (146) and its shorter, 11-item version, QuickDASH (147), provide self-administered measurements that focus on patients' symptoms and physical, social, and psychological aspects in populations with upper-extremity musculoskeletal conditions ( Table 3 ). More generally, subjects' perception of their quality of life can be measured with the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF) (148) or the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (149). The Orthotics and Prosthetics User's Survey (OPUS) (150) has also been used in upper-limb amputees (136). A recent study showed that long-term use of a sensorized prosthetic arm improved subjects' participation (e.g., skiing and fishing) (138); the authors performed semistructured interviews at patients' homes using a phenomenological approach to infer their experience with the prosthetic arm and to investigate the influence of a novel treatment within subjects' social groups (using an emic ethnographic approach) (151).\n\nAnother straightforward metric for evaluating the quality of a tool is patients' acceptance of the proposed protocol. Treatment adherence-measured by, for example, the number of sessions carried out by the patients per month, or the average session length-can help the experimenter develop tools that will be effectively used by the patients (151). In a study by Graczyk et al. (136) that compared the use of a prosthetic hand with and without tactile feedback, the subjects used a modified version of the OPUS Upper Extremity Functional Status module to report on a daily basis the difficulty of performing tasks such as brushing teeth or using a key in a lock.\n\nWhenconsidering RPHs,assessment of the motor (or sensorimotor) functions is clearly essential. As described above, somatosensory feedback is crucial to performing a dexterous motor task (152); therefore, functional tests for motor tasks also implicitly evaluate the sensory feedback. In other words, high performance in, for example, a pick-and-place task using a bidirectional RPH indicates both an accurate motor decoding and sensory feedback. Other assessments [e.g., the Virtual Egg T est (153)] target the somatosensory feedback more explicitly. Here, we describe both types of measurements.\n\nThe Box and Block T est (154) is a common evaluation of unilateral gross manual dexterity ( Figure 3 a ), where subjects must transport as many wooden blocks as possible from one compartment of a box to another within one minute. A modified version of this test with motion capture has been proposed (155) to evaluate eventual compensatory strategies of the shoulder or the trunk; a normative version using predefined positions of the blocks inside the box has also been proposed to facilitate kinematic analysis (156). The fine dexterity of fingers can be measured with the Nine Hole Peg T est, which involves the placing of small 1.3-cm-diameter dowels into nine holes (157). Variations of this test with motion tracking have also been proposed (158). The Clothespin Relocation T est ( Figure 3 b ) measures both grasping and pronation/supination functions (159).\n\nThe Action Research Arm T est ( Figure 3 c ) is one of the most widely used measurements for upper-extremity (arm and hand) functions (160). It assesses four basic movements: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movements of extension and flexion at the elbow and shoulder. Variously sized and shaped objects from daily living (a cup, a washer, etc.) are used for the test, which provides a broad overview of patients' improvement in the activity and impairment domains. Finally, the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure uses a set of abstract objects and activities of daily living with tasks specifically developed to assess the effectiveness of upper-limb prostheses (161).\n",

Sensory Feedback\nIn basic myoelectric or body-powered prostheses, feedback is delivered mainly by visually inspecting the movements of the prosthesis and by the physical interaction between the device and the user (126), as with hook prostheses. Clearly, the goal of a modern RPH is to deliver richer information more intuitively.\n\nSensory feedback strategies are characterized by their precision and the coherence between the evoked sensation and the desired one in terms of timing (synchronicity), position (somatotopy), and modality (i.e., touch, vibration, and temperature). Feedback techniques encode sensor values to stimulation parameters, which in turn are strongly tied to the chosen stimulation interface ( Table 2 ). Here, we focus mainly on electrical interfaces for feedback, but we also briefly discuss the mechanical interfaces.\n\nNoninvasive feedback strategies are attractive approaches since they do not necessitate surgical interventions ( Figure 2 a ). Starting with the Boston Arm, which Mann &amp; Reimers (127) used to demonstrate that position feedback was needed for precise reaching movements, these techniques have improved in both mechanical and electrical interfaces with the user. Indeed, the intact mechanoreceptors in the skin of the arm can be stimulated with small linear (128) or vibrating (129) motors that vary in their driving amplitude and frequency. On the other hand, mechanical stimulation brings an unavoidable delay of approximately 400 ms in the delivery of the sensation (130), and the integration and miniaturization of mechanoreceptors are challenging. The miniaturization of noninvasive feedback approaches is also challenging.\n",

Key concepts highlighted include the crucial characteristics of effective sensory feedback: timing (synchronicity), spatial alignment (somatotopy), and modality matching (e.g., touch, vibration, temperature). These parameters ensure that the evoked sensations closely replicate natural ones in a coherent manner, which is essential for intuitive prosthetic use.\n\nThe passage also touches on the methods and challenges of delivering such feedback, particularly through electrical interfaces and noninvasive mechanical stimulation. It notes that mechanical stimulation, while noninvasive, introduces significant delays (~400 ms) and difficulties in miniaturization, which can undermine the synchronicity and naturalness of feedback.\n\nImplicit in the text is the assumption that asynchronous or spatially mismatched feedback diminishes the functional and perceptual integration of prosthetic devices, leading to less effective user control and embodiment.

    "context": "## 3. INTERFACES WITH THE NEUROMUSCULAR SYSTEM\nDecades of work on robotic prosthetics have led to numerous invasive and noninvasive solutions for interfacing with the body (for a review, see 36) ( Table 1 ). Here, we describe existing technologies and outline the ones we consider the most promising for the future.\n\n\n## 3.1. Taxonomy of Existing Interfaces\nTo classify and evaluate the quality of an interface, selectivity-defined as the ability to record from a specific location within the nerve-is the most straightforward metric. Both spatial and temporal selectivity are important, naturally, as they enable better motor decoding and more localized sensory feedback. Electrode invasiveness, by contrast, is categorized into two large classes, surface electrodes and implanted electrodes, the latter of which includes extraneural (i.e., around the nerve) (37, 38), intraneural (i.e., through the nerve) (6), and regenerative approaches (where the nerve regrows inside the electrode) (39; for reviews, see 36, 40). Invasiveness is often seen as a trade-off to selectivity, with the observation that higher selectivity comes at the cost of greater invasiveness (41). While this relationship continues to be true to a large extent, two amendments are necessary: First, there are a multitude of other dimensions to consider, and second, recent\n\nresults are suggesting that the relationship might not be the same in the motor and the sensory domains. We detail both aspects here.\n\nBeyond the selectivity of an interface, it is crucial to consider its reach and level of discrimination. For example, transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) (42) and longitudinal intrafascicular electrodes (LIFEs) (43) can have a very similar selectivity, but TIMEs reach a more substantial proportion of the nerve and therefore can infer more information about the whole signal. Comparing muscle stimulation with different electrodes, Badia et al. (44) showed that a TIME could target three muscles, whereas they could not activate more than one muscle with a LIFE. Spatial discrimination of neural signals from nontarget signals is influenced not only by the electrode's invasiveness (how close it is to the source) but also by its geometry (e.g., a spherical point source targets a small volume), electrode material, and configuration (e.g., a cylindrical electrode better discriminates the axons perpendicular to the main axis) (45).\n\nSignal quality and stability are also important aspects that have been extensively studied. Work in this area has included interventions to improve the device-tissue interfaces [e.g., electrode coating (46) or a hollow glass cone that permits the ingrowth of cortical neurites in the electrodes (47)], electrode impedance, and filtering processes to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The recording stability depends on biocompatibility, the electrode's robustness (resistance to physical manipulation), and the stability of the contact between the interface and neural tissue. Significant efforts have been made to develop soft, implantable electrodes (48) in order to reduce insertion trauma and physical mismatches between neural tissues and implantable interfaces. Finally, properly anchoring the electrodes with the neural tissues is also essential to maintain a steady recording or stimulation site over time. This is particularly important in the sensory domain, where the stability of the elicited sensation is paramount for continuous use.\n\nFinally, practicalities such as the cost of the technology and the difficulty of the implant must be considered. As such, an implantation procedure based on a known surgical procedure (49) has a better chance to be accepted and adopted by surgeons. The use of existing devices, materials, and mature technologies is also a way to reduce costs and risks. An example of such a strategy is the use of Utah Arrays, which use well-established electrodes for brain recording, to interface with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nFor motor decoding, surface EMG (sEMG) approaches are by far the most widely used technique to date. Recent implementations using a large number of electrodes [termed high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) (50)] have shown unprecedented results in terms of accuracy and decoding robustness (for details, see Section 4). Implanted EMG (iEMG) has shown higher performance and stability than sEMG on the continuous control of three DOFs (51). However, studies have found no statistical difference in different electrodes' ability to differentiate among 12 types of grasps (52). Neural interfaces with the peripheral nerves have also shown promising results on grasp classification with TIMEs (53) and proportional control with a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (54). However, the development of real-time control and sensory feedback stimulation is still at an early stage (53, 54) and will need further investigation.\n\nIn the sensory domain, there is no current consensus for noninvasive approaches. T actile feedback using vibrotactile (55, 56), mechanotactile (57), or sensory substitution [e.g., audio (58)] has been proposed. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a viable noninvasive approach to induce close to natural sensation with amputee patients (59, 60). However, as detailed elsewhere in this review, current solutions using implanted electrodes (particularly intraneural interfaces) have shown levels of sensory recovery far superior to those of noninvasive approaches. This is true from a functional point of view [e.g., the possibility to encode texture (61) or shapes and stiffness (6)], phenomenologically [patients perceive the feedback as close to natural (62)], and in terms of cognitive load (63).\n",

    "context": "## Neuroprosthesis:\na device that connects to the nervous system and either replaces missing parts of it or improves it\n\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\nDecades of research on robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs) have led to a paradoxical situation: On the one hand, the development of novel RPHs is among the most exciting fields of robotics (1), but on the other hand, the vast majority of amputee patients still use technologies that have changed little in almost half a century. However, this apparent discrepancy might seem less surprising when considering the immense challenge of developing a prosthetic that can mimic the functions of a hand. Indeed, the hand has one of the largest sensory representations in the brain, and grasping is among the most complex coordination tasks (2); the hand has both the highest density of mechanoreceptors in the human body (see the sidebar titled Skin Mechanoreceptors) and the largest number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); and the hand permits people to both experience the surrounding world and shape it.\n\nThe challenges are multiple and intricate, and they can be overcome only by combining advanced mechatronic solutions for dexterous and highly sensorized robotic hands with new approaches for robust and effective interfaces with users' nervous systems to allow seamless naturalartificial integration. As such, several viable solutions can emerge from this multidimensional optimization problem.\n\nTremendous efforts have been made in the past 20 years on the quest for an RPH that is easy to wear, comfortable, and intuitive to control. The design of such a device can be considered a compromise among dexterity, robustness, and usability (3). In the past 5 years, another aspect has been proposed by researchers as an essential milestone: sensorization. Indeed, feedback systems can increase both the acceptability and the performance of the new generation of RPHs (4-6).\n\nThis review summarizes the main achievements in this field. In particular, after providing an overview of the existing neuroprostheses and their characteristics, we focus on four central aspects: ( a ) stable interfaces that enable a new connection with the nervous system to record neural signals and stimulate neural structures, ( b ) algorithmic strategies for decoding motor intentions, ( c ) RPH sensorization plus encoding strategies to convey somatosensory feedback, and ( d ) assessment methods to measure the efficacy of a given strategy or technology. Throughout the review, we keep a patient-centered perspective and ask ourselves, Does a novel approach significantly improve the subjects' quality of life? Is it easy to learn and natural to use? And does it improve their independence? On a technical aspect, our goal is to provide a critical view of the most advanced technologies and a perspective on future implementations of RPHs.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context focuses on the challenges and advancements in robotic prosthetic hands (RPHs), emphasizing the critical role of sensorization and somatosensory feedback in enhancing their acceptability and performance. The central ideas highlight the complexity of replicating hand functions due to its rich sensory representation, high degrees of freedom, and intricate motor coordination. The text stresses that integrating advanced sensorized robotic hands with robust neural interfaces is essential for natural and seamless user control. The recent emergence of sensorization as a milestone underscores its impact on user experience, especially in terms of device intuitiveness, comfort, and performance. The review also frames these advances within a patient-centered perspective, prioritizing quality of life, ease of learning, natural use, and independence.\n\nImplicitly, the text assumes that without effective sensorization and somatosensory feedback, RPHs remain limited in usability and user acceptance, despite mechanical advancements. It suggests that feedback mechanisms directly influence neuroprosthetic integration by enabling users to \"experience\" and \"shape\" their environment, which is fundamental for functional dexterity. The mention of encoding strategies for conveying somatosensory feedback implies complex algorithmic challenges in translating sensor data into meaningful neural stimuli. The question will probe the expert's understanding of why sensorization and somatosensory feedback are pivotal beyond mechanical dexterity, including neural integration, user experience, and overall device acceptance.\n\nDifficulty is rated at 9/10 because it requires synthesizing neurophysiological, engineering, and user-centered design perspectives. The question aims to encourage reflection on how sensorization transforms neuroprosthetic hands from mere mechanical tools into integrated extensions of the body that restore sensory-motor functions and improve life quality. It also invites discussion on the technical and clinical implications of feedback systems in neuroprostheses.\n\nThe question will be conceptual and analytical, focusing on the functional importance and impact of sensorization and somatosensory feedback on neuroprosthetic hand performance and acceptability.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How does the integration of sensorization and somatosensory feedback fundamentally transform the functional performance and user acceptability of neuroprosthetic hands beyond traditional mechanical dexterity?\n\nA: By enabling direct neural stimulation that enhances the user's perception of touch and proprioception, sensorization allows neuroprosthetic hands to provide naturalistic feedback, improving intuitive control and embodiment.\n\nB: By increasing the mechanical robustness and degrees of freedom of the prosthetic hand, sensorization primarily improves the device's physical durability and range of motion.\n\nC: Sensorization mainly serves to reduce the size and weight of neuroprosthetic hands, thereby making them more comfortable to wear without affecting user control or sensory experience.\n\nD: The integration of sensorization replaces the need for neural interfaces by fully automating hand movements through pre-programmed grasping patterns, thus simplifying control.\n\nExplanation: Sensorization and somatosensory feedback provide neural-level sensory information that enables users to perceive touch and position naturally, which enhances intuitive control, embodiment, and overall acceptability; this goes beyond mechanical dexterity alone, which focuses on movement but lacks sensory integration.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",
