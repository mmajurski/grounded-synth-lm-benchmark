To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to enhance static benchmarking and mitigate the impact of data contamination.\n\n\n##### 3.3.1 Canary String\nCanary strings are deliberately crafted, unique tokens embedded within a dataset to serve as markers for data contamination. When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al.

However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

Central to this is the formulation of a dynamic benchmark as a pair consisting of a dataset and a transformation function that modifies the dataset at each timestamp to prevent data contamination. The dataset is represented as a triple (inputs, outputs, scoring function), and the transformation function T(\u22c5) generates a sequence of datasets indexed by time, allowing continuous and adaptive evaluation.\n\nA critical nuance is the scenario where the initial seed dataset is empty, meaning the dynamic benchmark must be constructed from scratch. This implies that the benchmarking process must generate or collect evaluation data dynamically without any pre-existing samples. This raises complex challenges around how to ensure benchmark validity, relevance, and fairness without initial data anchors. The ability to create a benchmark entirely dynamically involves assumptions about data generation, contamination avoidance, and iterative evaluation strategies.\n\nImplicit assumptions include that the transformation functions can generate meaningful data or select relevant examples over time, and that the evaluation metrics remain consistent despite evolving data.

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n",

This is compounded by issues such as lack of transparency and assumptions in contamination detection. The text also contrasts static benchmarks with emerging dynamic benchmarks, which aim to mitigate contamination but introduce challenges such as balancing correctness, scalability, and complexity control. The lack of standardized criteria for dynamic benchmark evaluation is identified as a significant gap.

Label protection, on the other hand, involves hiding the true answers (labels) of test data, commonly used in well-known benchmarks, to prevent models from memorizing or being exposed to answers during training, thus preserving evaluation integrity.\n\nThe nuanced relationship here is that both methods aim to prevent data leakage but do so through different mechanisms\u2014encryption protects the data itself from access, while label protection controls access to the answers.

Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring that benchmarks provide an accurate and reliable measure of an LLM\u2019s true ability to handle novel and unseen data.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context focuses on the concept of static benchmarking as a method for evaluating language model performance across multiple dimensions, including commonsense reasoning, factual knowledge retrieval, and toxicity detection, among others.

The text emphasizes the breadth of tasks covered by these benchmarks and their role as standardized evaluation tools. \n\nImplicitly, static benchmarks reveal both strengths and weaknesses of language models by providing a fixed, repeatable set of challenges. This allows for systematic identification of areas where models excel or struggle, such as reasoning or safety-related tasks. However, the static nature also imposes limitations: benchmarks may become outdated or fail to capture evolving language use or nuanced contexts, which affects the interpretation of model competence in real-world applications.\n\nThe complexity of the topic is high (rated 8/10) because it involves understanding formal evaluation frameworks, their theoretical underpinnings, and practical implications for assessing diverse and complex model capabilities. A probing question would challenge experts to critically analyze how static benchmarks both illuminate and potentially obscure true model abilities, especially in subtle tasks like commonsense reasoning or toxicity detection, where context and nuance matter.\n\nThe question should encourage reflection on the trade-offs inherent in static benchmarking: the balance between standardization and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of language understanding.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n",

The passage also contrasts static benchmarks with dynamic benchmarks as a mitigation strategy. Implicit in this is the critical function contamination detectors serve not only in identifying contamination but also in guiding the development of benchmarks that can adapt or remain reliable despite model training data overlap.\n\nThe nuanced theme here involves understanding how contamination detectors operate as risk quantification tools, the technical challenges in detecting contamination given the evolving data landscape, and their impact on maintaining benchmarking integrity.

In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the challenge of data contamination in large language model (LLM) training and evaluation due to the lack of transparency about training datasets. It highlights that unlike traditional models, LLMs are trained on vast, heterogeneous corpora, often scraped from the internet, which increases the likelihood that evaluation data overlaps with training data. This overlap can be further complicated by post-training fine-tuning on datasets similar to evaluation tasks. Detection methods to identify contamination exist but are limited by the enormous scale and complexity of training data. Furthermore, the proprietary nature of many LLM training datasets adds an ethical and methodological barrier to accurately assessing model performance claims, as external researchers cannot verify whether evaluation benchmarks are truly unseen by the model. This opacity raises concerns about fairness and reliability in benchmarking, as performance gains may be inflated due to data leakage rather than genuine generalization.

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

This latter method is exemplified by prominent benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval, where test labels are withheld to prevent models from memorizing answers and compromising evaluation integrity.\n\nThe key nuanced theme is the trade-off between securing data accessibility (encryption) versus securing answer exposure (label protection), and how label protection uniquely preserves the evaluation's integrity by blocking direct answer learning. The context implicitly assumes that model training data contamination with test answers is a critical issue that can invalidate benchmarks. It also suggests that label protection is a practical and widely used solution in major language understanding and coding benchmarks.\n\nThe complexity is high (rated 8/10) because it involves understanding advanced data privacy techniques, the implications of data leakage on model evaluation, and the distinct operational mechanisms of encryption versus label protection.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n",

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

To this end, we propose the following evaluation criteria to assess the quality of a dynamic benchmarking algorithm.\n\n\n##### 4.2.1 Correctness\nThe first criterion for evaluating the quality of dynamic benchmarking is Correctness. If the correctness of the generated dataset cannot be guaranteed, the benchmark may provide a false sense of reliability when applied to benchmarking LLMs, leading to misleading evaluations.\n\nWe quantify the correctness of dynamic benchmarks as:\n\nwhere \ud835\udcb3isubscript\ud835\udcb3\ud835\udc56\\mathcal{X}\\_{i}caligraphic\\_X start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and \ud835\udcb4isubscript\ud835\udcb4\ud835\udc56\\mathcal{Y}\\_{i}caligraphic\\_Y start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT represent the input and output of the it\u2062hsuperscript\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210ei^{th}italic\\_i start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_t italic\\_h end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT transformation, respectively.

For example, the function \ud835\udca2\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udca2\u22c5\\mathcal{G}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_G ( \u22c5 ) could be a domain-specific an annotator.\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the expected alignment between the transformed dataset\u2019s outputs and their corresponding ground truth values, measured using the scoring function \ud835\udcae\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udcae\u22c5\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_S ( \u22c5 ).

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context focuses on the importance of \"Correctness\" as a fundamental evaluation criterion for dynamic benchmarking algorithms used to assess large language models (LLMs). The central idea is that without guaranteed correctness, the benchmarking process risks producing misleading or unreliable evaluations of LLM capabilities. The text defines correctness in a formalized manner: it is the expected alignment between outputs generated by a transformation function applied to inputs (the dynamic benchmark dataset) and the ground truth outputs as determined by an oracle function. The oracle serves as an objective, domain-specific annotator or verifier that provides the \"true\" outputs for comparison. The scoring function quantifies this alignment, and a higher score means better correctness, thus a more reliable benchmark.\n\nKey nuanced themes include:\n- The necessity of correctness for trustworthiness in benchmarking.\n- The role of an oracle function as a ground truth provider.\n- The mathematical abstraction of correctness as an expectation over scoring alignment.\n- The implication that without correctness, benchmarks may give false confidence in LLM performance.\n\nImplicit assumptions:\n- The oracle is assumed to be accurate and authoritative.\n- Correctness is foundational and likely prerequisite before other criteria (such as diversity or difficulty) are meaningful.\n- The benchmarking process is dynamic and involves transformations that could introduce errors or deviations from truth.\n\nPotential applications:\n- Designing or evaluating new dynamic benchmarking algorithms.\n- Understanding limitations of benchmarks lacking correctness guarantees.\n- Informing improvements in benchmarking practices to ensure reliable LLM evaluation.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

It should challenge experts to explain why correctness is foundational and what risks arise if it is not ensured, requiring synthesis of conceptual, formal, and practical aspects. The options will include subtle distinctions about the oracle\u2019s role, the scoring function, and implications for benchmark reliability.\n\nThis approach will push domain experts to demonstrate nuanced understanding beyond mere definitions, reflecting on theoretical and applied dimensions of correctness in dynamic benchmarking for LLMs.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of dynamic benchmarking algorithms for large language models, why is the correctness criterion considered foundational, and how does the incorporation of an oracle function and a scoring function collectively ensure the reliability of the benchmark evaluation?\n\nA: Because correctness guarantees that the generated dataset outputs exactly match the original inputs, the oracle function serves to reconstruct inputs, and the scoring function measures input similarity, ensuring the benchmark evaluates data fidelity.\n\nB: Because correctness ensures that the benchmark outputs align with ground truth values as verified by the oracle, while the scoring function quantifies this alignment, thereby preventing misleading evaluations by providing an objective measure of dataset reliability.\n\nC: Because correctness focuses on maximizing the diversity of outputs, the oracle function generates varied data points, and the scoring function evaluates the novelty of outputs, ensuring the benchmark challenges the language model effectively.\n\nD: Because correctness validates the speed of dataset generation, the oracle function assesses computational efficiency, and the scoring function measures runtime performance to ensure scalable benchmarking.\n\nExplanation: Correctness is foundational because it guarantees that the dynamic benchmark outputs correspond accurately to ground truth, preventing false confidence in model evaluations.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a concise yet technical explanation of diversity metrics in transformed datasets, specifically distinguishing between external diversity and internal diversity. External diversity assesses the variation between each transformed dataset and the original seed dataset, while internal diversity measures variation among different transformed datasets themselves. The mathematical notation uses expectation over N datasets and a diversity function \u0398(\u00b7) that quantifies differences, with examples such as N-gram or BLEU scores to measure similarity or diversity.\n\nKey points:\n- Clear formal definitions of external and internal diversity.\n- \u0398(\u00b7) can be any metric that measures diversity or difference between datasets.\n- External diversity involves comparison to a fixed seed dataset.\n- Internal diversity involves pairwise comparison between transformed datasets, excluding self-comparisons.\n- Examples suggest metrics typically used in natural language generation or other domains where datasets are collections of discrete elements.\n\nImplicitly, estimating these metrics requires multiple transformation trials to produce multiple datasets (at least N > 1), and a reliable \u0398 function that meaningfully captures diversity.\n\nTo empirically estimate these metrics in practice:\n- For external diversity: generate multiple transformed datasets from the seed, compute \u0398 between each transformed set and the seed, then average.\n- For internal diversity: compute \u0398 between every pair of distinct transformed datasets, then average.\n\nValidation of estimates would likely involve:\n- Ensuring \u0398 function correlates with human or domain expert judgments of diversity.\n- Checking consistency across multiple runs or subsets.\n- Possibly using reference metrics or ground truth diversity benchmarks.\n\nDifficulty rating: 8/10.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials. Repeat Trials quantifies the expected number of transformation trials required to fully regenerate an existing transformed dataset Ti\u2062(\ud835\udc9f)subscript\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc9fT\\_{i}(\\mathcal{D})italic\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( caligraphic\\_D ), providing insight into the benchmark\u2019s ability to produce novel variations.\n\nThese metrics help assess whether a dynamic benchmark remains effective in evaluating LLM capabilities, even when exposed to potential training data contamination.\n",

The central idea is the challenge of maintaining benchmark transparency while avoiding contamination when benchmarks are publicly available and possibly used in training. Collision is defined as the degree of overlap between different transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, which could limit the generation of novel test cases and thus reduce the benchmark\u2019s effectiveness. Two metrics are introduced: Collision Rate, which quantifies the percentage overlap between two independently transformed datasets, and Repeat Trials, which indicates how many transformation attempts are needed to recreate an existing transformed dataset, reflecting the benchmark\u2019s capacity for novel transformations.\n\nThis concept implicitly assumes the importance of dataset diversity and transformation independence to maintain benchmark robustness and prevent misleading evaluation results due to contamination. The metrics serve to quantify and analyze this overlap, providing a means to assess whether a dynamic benchmark can still fairly evaluate LLM capabilities despite potential contamination risks.\n\nThe difficulty level is high (around 8-9) because it requires understanding advanced benchmarking concepts, data transformation, contamination risks, and metric design to quantify overlap and diversity in datasets.\n\nA challenging question should probe deep understanding of why collision matters, how the Collision Rate is calculated, and its implications for the validity and reliability of dynamic benchmarks in evaluating LLMs. It could also explore the relationship between Collision Rate and Repeat Trials metrics to critically assess benchmark robustness.\n\nThe question should encourage reflection on how overlap affects benchmark utility and the broader implications for benchmarking LLMs in transparent but contamination-prone environments.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of dynamic benchmarking for large language models, how does the Collision Rate metric precisely quantify overlap between independently transformed benchmark datasets, and why is this quantification critical for ensuring the benchmark\u2019s reliability in the presence of potential training data contamination?\n\nA: Collision Rate measures the proportion of identical data samples shared between two transformed datasets, which is critical because high overlap indicates reduced novelty in test cases, undermining the benchmark\u2019s ability to reliably evaluate model capabilities after contamination.  \nB: Collision Rate calculates the total number of unique transformations applied to the benchmark, ensuring that the dataset is diverse enough to prevent any contamination during training.  \nC: Collision Rate assesses the frequency of repeated transformation trials needed to produce a new dataset, thus directly measuring the benchmark\u2019s resilience to contamination by counting unique trial attempts.  \nD: Collision Rate evaluates the percentage of benchmark data excluded from the training set, guaranteeing no overlap exists and thereby fully eliminating contamination risks.\n\nExplanation: Collision Rate specifically quantifies the percentage overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, highlighting the extent to which data contamination could occur by reusing similar test samples.

C2LEVA is noted as a framework that uniquely integrates all three methods to build a bilingual, contamination-free evaluation benchmark.\n\nKey nuanced points include:\n- The relationship between dataset size and contamination risk, emphasizing the mathematical proportionality.\n- Limitations of traditional static benchmarks due to transparency and contamination detection challenges.\n- The trade-offs dynamic benchmarks face, such as balancing correctness and scalability, and the need for complexity control.\n- The lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks, with a call for future standardization.\n\nThe rationale behind combining multiple contamination-free methods (as C2LEVA does) seems to be to leverage complementary strengths of each method to maximize contamination prevention, improve reliability, and ensure bilingual coverage.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10 \u2014 The question must probe understanding of contamination risks, the complementary nature of different methods, and implications for benchmark integrity, requiring synthesis of technical and theoretical considerations about benchmarking frameworks.\n\nThe planned question will ask why integrating multiple contamination-free methods (like in C2LEVA) is essential to enhance benchmark integrity, inviting reflection on contamination dynamics, limitations of singular methods, and the technical benefits of hybrid approaches.\n\nThis question encourages critical engagement with contamination theory, benchmark design trade-offs, and practical implications for LLM evaluation.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Considering the increasing risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarks as training corpora scale, why does combining multiple contamination-free construction methods\u2014such as temporal cutoff, LLM-based generation, and graph-based perturbation\u2014in frameworks like C2LEVA critically enhance the integrity and reliability of benchmark evaluations?\n\nA: Because integrating multiple methods allows for simultaneous mitigation of diverse contamination pathways, compensates for individual method limitations, and ensures robustness across different data domains and languages.\n\nB: Because using multiple methods primarily reduces the computational cost of generating benchmark samples by distributing workload across different techniques.\n\nC: Because the combination mainly facilitates faster annotation by human evaluators due to varied sample generation styles improving annotator engagement.\n\nD: Because applying multiple methods guarantees that benchmarks remain static and unchanging, preventing any updates that might introduce contamination.\n\nExplanation: Combining multiple contamination-free methods addresses distinct contamination risks inherent in each approach, creating a more comprehensive and robust defense against overlap with training data.

These benchmarks cover a broad range of tasks including math, language, coding, reasoning, knowledge, safety, instruction following, and reading comprehension.

It emphasizes that static benchmarks serve as standardized tools to measure diverse capabilities such as math, language, coding, reasoning, knowledge, safety, instruction following, and reading comprehension.

The text highlights the breadth of tasks these benchmarks cover, illustrating their role in assessing distinct dimensions of model performance in a controlled, reproducible manner.\n\nImplicit in this formulation is the assumption that static benchmarks are fixed (do not change dynamically during evaluation), providing a stable ground truth against which LLMs can be objectively measured. This also implies certain limitations, such as potentially not capturing adaptive or interactive capabilities of LLMs. The scoring function\u2019s design and accuracy critically affect the validity of the evaluation, as it must meaningfully quantify output quality across varied tasks.\n\nThe difficulty level for a question about this content is high (rated 8/10) because it requires a deep understanding of the conceptual framework of static benchmarks, their multi-dimensional evaluation scope, and the formalization of their problem structure.

To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to enhance static benchmarking and mitigate the impact of data contamination.\n\n\n##### 3.3.1 Canary String\nCanary strings are deliberately crafted, unique tokens embedded within a dataset to serve as markers for data contamination. When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.
