This strategy is designed to mitigate data contamination\u2014where test data may have inadvertently appeared in the model's training data. Several domain-specific benchmark efforts are described: LiveBench (math competitions), AntiLeak-Bench (recently emerged knowledge), AcademicEval (academic writing on new arXiv papers), LiveCodeBench (coding competition problems), LiveAoPSBench (math problems from a specific forum), and Forecastbench (forecasting questions from prediction markets). The core idea is that domain specificity (e.g., using data from math competitions, coding platforms, academic papers, or prediction markets) can play a crucial role in the robustness and reliability of temporal cutoff-based benchmarks.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit is the assumption that domain-specific data sources offer unique, frequently updated, and non-overlapping datasets, making it difficult for LLMs to have been exposed to them during training. There's also a subtle distinction in the types of domains: competitive environments (math, coding), academic publishing, and real-time prediction markets, each with their own rates and patterns of new data generation, and potential for overlap or leakage. The underlying theory is that the more \"live\" and specialized the data source, the more robust the benchmark will be to contamination, thus providing a more reliable measure of model performance on genuinely novel information.\n\n3.

Two primary types of contamination are described: (a) exact contamination, where test examples are duplicated verbatim in the training set, and (b) syntactic contamination, where a transformed version of a test example (via syntactic changes that preserve meaning) exists in the training data. The text specifies syntactic transformations (punctuation normalization, whitespace, synonym substitution, morphological variation, paraphrasing) and highlights the importance of lexical meaning preservation.\n\n2.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses the concept of \"collision\" in the realm of dynamic benchmarking, particularly regarding Large Language Models (LLMs). The central concern is that if dynamic benchmarks are publicly available, they might unintentionally contaminate LLM training data, undermining their utility for objective evaluation. To address this, the notion of collision is introduced, which quantifies the overlap between independently generated transformations of the same dataset. Two metrics are defined: Collision Rate (the percentage overlap between two transformed datasets) and Repeat Trials (the expected number of transformation attempts needed to regenerate a specific dataset instance). \n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe text implies that a high Collision Rate suggests poor novelty in benchmark transformations, increasing the risk that benchmarks can be memorized by LLMs, thus compromising the assessment. Conversely, a low Collision Rate indicates that transformations are more diverse and less likely to overlap, preserving benchmark integrity.

These benchmarks cover a broad range of tasks including math, language, coding, reasoning, knowledge, safety, instruction following, and reading comprehension.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context elaborates on static benchmarking for evaluating LLMs. It introduces static benchmarks as consisting of three components: input prompts (\ud835\udcb3), expected outputs (\ud835\udcb4), and a scoring function (\ud835\udcae(.)) that evaluates the LLM\u2019s outputs by comparing them to \ud835\udcb4. The scoring function is central for quantifying how well a model output aligns with the expected output, making its design fundamental to reliable benchmarking.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe scoring function (\ud835\udcae(.)) implicitly assumes the possibility of establishing a metric or criteria that can reliably and meaningfully measure the \"quality\" of LLM outputs. Its design must account for the nuances of different tasks (e.g., math vs. language), the possibility of multiple valid outputs, and the subjectivity or objectivity of certain assessments. The effectiveness of a benchmark is thus highly sensitive to the appropriateness and robustness of \ud835\udcae(.).\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. A challenging question should demand knowledge of evaluation theory, the implications of scoring function design, and the subtle trade-offs in benchmarking LLMs.\n\n4.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context centers on the formalization and motivation for dynamic benchmarking in evaluating large language models (LLMs), contrasting it with the limitations of static benchmarks. It highlights that static benchmarks can be compromised due to data contamination and that dynamic benchmarks, defined via a transformation function T(\u00b7) applied over time to a dataset D, attempt to address this. There is mention of a table (Table 3) that evaluates existing dynamic benchmarks against summarized quality criteria, though the table itself is not available. Symbolic representations (\u25cf for support, \u25d0 for partial, \u25cb for none) are used to indicate benchmark support for each criterion.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe implicit assumption is that dynamic benchmarks must be judged by specific, perhaps multidimensional, criteria, which are not explicitly enumerated here but are referenced as summarized in the table. The context alludes to the need for transparency, faithfulness, and mitigation of contamination in evaluation. It is implied that the criteria likely relate to the ability of a benchmark to provide fair, uncontaminated, and adaptable evaluation over time. Since the actual criteria are not listed, a domain expert must infer what high-quality dynamic benchmarking should entail from the surrounding discussion.\n\n3.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context addresses the constraints that label protection imposes on transparency, independent verification, and reproducibility in machine learning evaluation. Label protection requires that researchers depend on centralized evaluation systems, which limits the ability to perform detailed error analyses and replicate results independently. The text also details methods for post-hoc detection of data contamination, such as identifying overlaps between training and test data, typically via n-gram or embedding-based similarity, and behavioral analyses under various input conditions.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe discussion implicitly assumes that transparency and independent verification are core principles for scientific rigor in machine learning but acknowledges that protecting labels to prevent leakage creates a tradeoff. The reliance on centralized systems affects not only transparency but also the ability to reproduce and verify results externally. The post-hoc detection section underscores the complexity of ensuring uncontaminated evaluation, highlighting the limitations of exact matching and the need for more sophisticated metrics. These methods, however, are only partially effective and further complicated by label protection, which may obscure data characteristics necessary for robust detection.\n\n3.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses limitations of current contamination detection in machine learning datasets, specifically the lack of transparency due to label protection and reliance on centralized evaluation. The main technical focus is on post-hoc detection of data contamination\u2014identifying overlap between training and test sets. Standard n-gram matching (token or word level) is noted to often yield false negatives, motivating the adoption of embedding-based similarity measures and improved mapping metrics for more robust detection.

The central theme is that label protection and centralized evaluation hinder transparency, independent verification, detailed error analysis, and reproducibility, while post-hoc detection methods attempt to mitigate contamination.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nA key implicit assumption is that label protection, while perhaps ensuring data privacy or integrity, creates a tradeoff by limiting access to ground-truth labels, thus impeding error analysis. Centralized evaluation systems act as bottlenecks: they provide performance metrics but limit the granularity of error analysis, making it hard for researchers to independently verify or investigate model failures.

When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al.

Central ideas include the relationship between dataset size and statistical errors, the optimal goal of producing larger datasets at lower costs, and a formal definition of scalability as the expectation over all transformation scenarios of the ratio of transformed dataset size to the cost of transformation. Important relationships are highlighted between dataset size, transformation costs (which can be monetary, time, or manual effort), and statistical reliability.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in the discussion is the assumption that larger datasets generally improve statistical validity in benchmarking, but the process of generating such datasets is constrained by various costs. The scalability metric is thus a nuanced measure balancing output volume against resource expenditure, and its computation as an expectation over the transformation space introduces additional complexity, suggesting that both the diversity of transformations and their resource implications are relevant.

To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking.\n\nIn this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks.

To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to enhance static benchmarking and mitigate the impact of data contamination.\n\n\n##### 3.3.1 Canary String\nCanary strings are deliberately crafted, unique tokens embedded within a dataset to serve as markers for data contamination. When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\n###### Limitations\nThe effectiveness of canary strings depends on model trainers being aware of and responsive to these markers.\n\nIf a developer aims to leak benchmarking data to boost scores, this method will not work.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context introduces the problem of data contamination in large language model (LLM) benchmarks, where models may inadvertently train on evaluation data, leading to inflated and unreliable performance metrics. Canary strings are described as unique tokens inserted into datasets to function as contamination markers. If a model outputs these tokens, it suggests memorization rather than generalization. The example of BIG-Bench is given, and a key limitation is that this approach only works if model trainers proactively look for and filter these canaries. It is ineffective if a developer intentionally leaks benchmark data to inflate scores.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe passage touches on implicit assumptions: canary strings are unique and thus unlikely to be generated unless memorized; identification relies on honest detection and reporting; and malicious actors can circumvent this mechanism. Subtle details include the ethical and procedural limitations of the method. The mechanism's utility is as a detection tool rather than a preventive measure.\n\n3.

The question should probe not just the basic definition, but the operational mechanism, limitations, and subtleties\u2014especially around detection, memorization, and adversarial scenarios.\n\n4. Intentional Question Planning:\nThe question should require the expert to differentiate canary strings from other contamination detection methods, understand their precise operational function, and critically evaluate their limitations, especially in adversarial contexts.

The principal limitation is that this method depends on the vigilance and integrity of those evaluating the model; if trainers ignore or intentionally misuse the mechanism, it fails to prevent or detect contamination.

Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al.

(2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al.

Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al.

Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design.

To ensure correctness, the transformation process must be interpretable. Interpretable transformations reduce the need for extensive manual validation, lowering costs. Rule-based or manually crafted transformations are inherently interpretable, while LLM-assisted transformations depend on the model\u2019s transparency and traceability. In such cases, additional mechanisms like explainability tools, or human-in-the-loop validation may be needed to ensure reliability and correctness.\n\n\n#### 4.3 Existing Work\nBuilding on the task formats of static benchmarks, dynamic benchmarks have been introduced to assess LLM capabilities while minimizing data contamination and ensuring fairness.\n\nTable\u00a02 summarizes recent dynamic benchmarks for LLM evaluation.\n\nDynamic benchmarks can be categorized into four types based on their construction process: temporal cutoff, rule-based generation, LLM-based generation, and hybrid approaches.\n\nTemporal cutoff follows a data collection process similar to static benchmarks, with the key difference being that data is gathered from newly released information.\n\nRule-based and LLM-based generation approaches create novel evaluation data points using predefined rules or by leveraging the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.\n\nFinally, hybrid approaches combine the idea of these different approaches.\n",

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses the challenges and requirements of interpretability in the dynamic benchmarking of large language models (LLMs). It highlights the difficulties in manual verification due to the volume and transformation of data, advocating for interpretable transformation processes. The text also explores the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarks, categorizing dynamic benchmarking approaches (temporal cutoff, rule-based, LLM-based, and hybrid) and their purposes, notably minimizing data contamination and promoting fairness.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the context assumes that static benchmarks are more susceptible to data contamination due to overlap with training data, which could compromise fairness in evaluation. The transition to dynamic benchmarks is motivated by the need to create novel, uncontaminated data. However, this introduces challenges in interpretability and verification, especially when using advanced generative techniques. There is a tension between automation (efficiency and novelty) and the need for transparency (interpretability and fairness).\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty rating: 9/10.

In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string. There is ongoing debate about whether such syntactic transformations constitute true data contamination, as it is challenging to distinguish between an LLM\u2019s ability to recall memorized information and its reasoning capability during inference. In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring that benchmarks provide an accurate and reliable measure of an LLM\u2019s true ability to handle novel and unseen data.\n",

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

Critically, while dynamic benchmarks are seen as a solution to static benchmark contamination, they bring their own challenges\u2014particularly the lack of standardized evaluation criteria, issues of scalability, correctness, and complexity control.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**:  \nImplicit is the recognition that as LLM training scales, data leakage and contamination become almost unavoidable without dynamic benchmarks.

External diversity refers to the variation between a transformed dataset and its corresponding seed dataset, while internal diversity quantifies the differences between multiple transformed datasets produced in different transformation trials.

High external diversity may indicate that the transformation is introducing substantial novelty relative to the original data, while high internal diversity suggests the method is not deterministic and produces a broad spectrum of outputs.

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

It details how static benchmarks, though widely used, are susceptible to contamination as LLMs may inadvertently train on benchmark data, leading to inflated performance metrics. Various mitigation strategies (encryption, post-hoc detection) and emerging dynamic benchmarking methods (dataset updates, data regeneration) are mentioned. A critical insight is the explicit recognition that, despite the proliferation of dynamic benchmarking approaches, there is an absence of systematic surveys or frameworks in the literature that comprehensively summarize, categorize, or evaluate these methods. Moreover, existing reviews focus on post-hoc contamination and fail to address dynamic strategies or establish evaluation criteria for dynamic benchmarks themselves.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**:  \nImplicit in the text is the challenge posed by the rapid evolution of LLMs and their data sources, which complicates benchmarking reliability. The need for evaluation criteria signals that, without a standard framework, dynamic benchmarking methods may lack rigor, comparability, or adoption.

Each benchmark within these domains targets specific capabilities, such as code generation/debugging (HumanEval, MBPP, SWE-Bench), dynamic problem solving (Codeforces, Aider), instruction comprehension and execution (IFEval, InfoBench, C-Eval), and a wide range of reasoning abilities (PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC, OpenBookQA, CommonsenseQA, C-SimpleQA). There is a clear distinction between benchmarks that focus on technical/programmatic competencies, those measuring procedural following, and those probing intuitive/logical reasoning, with some attention to language (e.g., Chinese-specific sets).\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in the listing is the assumption that these benchmarks, while diverse, may not capture the full spectrum of complex, real-world language model abilities. For instance, some benchmarks are language-specific, others focus on synthesis/debugging, and some require integration of background knowledge. However, the context does not discuss cross-domain generalization, compositional abilities, or real-world applicability beyond simulation.

Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n",

The limitations note the survey's high-level focus, the evolving nature of benchmarking, and the preliminary nature of proposed dynamic benchmarking criteria.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: Implicitly, static benchmarking is easier to standardize, but its static nature makes it more susceptible to contamination, especially as training data expands and overlaps with benchmarks. Dynamic approaches could mitigate contamination by generating or sampling new benchmarks, but introduce problems around result consistency and the ability for others to reproduce findings.

The text outlines several benchmarks (LiveBench, AntiLeak-Bench, AcademicEval, LiveCodeBench, LiveAoPSBench, Forecastbench) that incorporate fresh, temporally relevant data to ensure the evaluation is robust against models simply memorizing previously available information. The central idea is the tension between reliable, uncontaminated evaluation and the logistical/technical challenges of keeping benchmarks current.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**  \nImplicit in this discussion are assumptions about the nature of LLM training (i.e., static datasets with fixed knowledge cutoffs), the risk of data leakage contaminating evaluation results, and the necessity of temporal relevance for benchmark validity. Underlying theories involve the measurement of generalization versus memorization, and potential applications include more accurate, trustworthy assessment of LLM capabilities in changing domains (e.g., news, recent academic work, coding challenges).

Data contamination refers to the inadvertent inclusion of benchmark or evaluation data within the training corpus, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics. The text notes a shift from static to dynamic benchmarking as a mitigation strategy. Static benchmarks, which remain unchanged, can be easily leaked into training data, whereas dynamic benchmarks evolve to minimize this risk. However, the analysis reveals that while methods to enhance static benchmarks exist, they have limitations, and there is a notable absence of standardized criteria for dynamic benchmarks.

If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications. For example, DyVal\u00a0(Zhu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes applying graph complexity to evaluate the complexity of reasoning problems.\n\nFormally, given a complexity measurement function \u03a8\u2062(\u22c5)\u03a8\u22c5\\Psi(\\cdot)roman\\_\u03a8 ( \u22c5 ), the stability can be formulated as:\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the variance in complexity across different trials, where high variance indicates that the dynamic benchmarking method is not stable.\n",

DyVal is cited as an example, using graph complexity for reasoning problems. The text then introduces a formalism: using a complexity measurement function \u03a8(\u00b7), and relates the stability of a dynamic benchmarking method to the variance of complexity across different trials\u2014high variance implies instability.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in the discussion is the need for consistent, generalizable complexity metrics for benchmarking. The mention of variance in complexity as a measure of stability suggests a statistical approach to evaluating benchmarking methods.

Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in the discussion is the assumption that overlapping (colliding) data points between transformations reduce the benchmark's effectiveness due to decreased novelty and increased risk of contamination.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses the challenges dynamic benchmarks face in evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities, particularly when benchmarks are public and risk being incorporated into LLM training data\u2014an issue known as data contamination. The central theme is the introduction of \"collision\" as a concept and associated metrics to assess the robustness of dynamic benchmarks under such contamination. Collision measures the overlap between different benchmark transformations; high collision implies less novelty and greater risk that LLMs have effectively \"seen\" test cases via training data. The two main metrics are Collision Rate (the percentage overlap between two transformations) and Repeat Trials (the expected number of trials to regenerate an existing transformed dataset).\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe context implicitly assumes that dynamic benchmarks are only effective if they can continue producing novel test cases, even after partial or full exposure of previous test sets to LLM training. Collision metrics thus become a proxy for the \"novelty reserve\" of a benchmark. A low collision rate and high repeat trials indicate resilience to contamination, suggesting the benchmark can still generate unseen, challenging examples. Conversely, high collision or low repeat trials suggest diminished effectiveness\u2014the benchmark is likely to re-generate contaminated, previously seen data, undermining its integrity.\n\n3.

If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications. For example, DyVal\u00a0(Zhu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes applying graph complexity to evaluate the complexity of reasoning problems.\n\nFormally, given a complexity measurement function \u03a8\u2062(\u22c5)\u03a8\u22c5\\Psi(\\cdot)roman\\_\u03a8 ( \u22c5 ), the stability can be formulated as:\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the variance in complexity across different trials, where high variance indicates that the dynamic benchmarking method is not stable.\n",

The central idea is that performance drops may be due to increased complexity rather than just data contamination, making it critical to isolate and quantify complexity changes. It highlights the challenge of measuring complexity rigorously, noting that most complexity metrics are domain-specific and lack generalizability. DyVal is mentioned as an approach leveraging graph complexity for reasoning problems. The notion of 'stability' is introduced, formalized as the variance in complexity across dynamic benchmark trials; high variance undermines stable benchmarking.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: Implicitly, the text assumes that performance evaluation is only meaningful if complexity is controlled or at least measured accurately. The challenge of generalizable complexity metrics suggests that benchmarking across domains (e.g., reasoning vs. language tasks) is non-trivial. The importance of stability (low variance in complexity) in dynamic benchmarks is highlighted, as instability can confound conclusions about LLM performance.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: Difficulty rating: 9/10. The topic is inherently technical and involves nuanced understanding of machine learning evaluation, dataset construction, and statistical measurement.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n",

The survey highlights that static methods, while consistent, are increasingly susceptible to contamination as training datasets expand. Dynamic approaches, though promising, face issues with reliability and reproducibility. The text explicitly states that future research should focus on standardizing dynamic evaluation and developing practical mitigation tools.

Concept Exploration:\nThe context implicitly explores a tension between providing a broad, conceptual understanding (which aids in framing, comparing, and evaluating approaches) and the need for technical details, which enable practitioners to apply, adapt, or reproduce methods in practice. The text suggests that while a high-level overview can guide strategic decision-making or inform future research directions, it may fall short for hands-on application or operationalization.

Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses the limitations of post-hoc detection methods and, more centrally, the motivation for dynamic benchmarking as a response to the limitations of static benchmarking in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). It highlights that static benchmarks, due to their fixed nature, may suffer from issues such as data contamination (where models have seen evaluation data during training), and face challenges in providing transparent, faithful evaluation because of restricted access to training data and varying model behaviors. The introduction of dynamic benchmarking is presented as a solution: benchmarks that are not static, but instead are transformed over time via a function T(\u00b7), generating new evaluation datasets at each timestamp t, thereby actively mitigating contamination and adapting to evolving evaluation needs.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicitly, the motivation for dynamic benchmarking is to overcome the static nature of traditional benchmarks, which become stale and vulnerable to contamination as LLMs evolve and as models may have had access to benchmark data during their training. The use of a transformation function T(\u00b7) reflects an adaptive approach, making benchmarks less predictable and more robust against data leakage. The mention of the seed dataset being empty and dynamic benchmarks being created from scratch suggests a further layer of flexibility and novelty in testing. The approach is thus rooted in the theory that robust, faithful evaluation requires dynamic adaptation to both model capabilities and data access realities.\n\n3.

The contamination detector\u2019s effectiveness is critical for ITD's workflow; it must reliably identify contaminated samples so the rewriting process can target the right data. The preservation of sample difficulty during LLM-driven rewriting is a nuanced requirement: rewriting must not inadvertently simplify or complicate the benchmark items, which could compromise the validity of subsequent evaluations.

(2023) show that even advanced decontamination methods can be defeated by minor text variations, emphasizing the need for robust encryption. Similarly, TRUCE (Chandran et\u00a0al., 2024) leverages confidential computing and secure multi-party computation to enable private benchmarking, ensuring that test data and model parameters remain confidential.\n\n\n###### Limitation\nWhile these methods effectively protect against data leakage, they depend on strong key management, they introduce extra computational overheads. These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment.

It primarily focuses on encryption techniques, including public key encryption, confidential computing, and secure multi-party computation (SMPC), and briefly compares them with label protection strategies. Key points include the use of public key encryption to block unauthorized access and crawling, the role of confidential computing and SMPC (e.g., TRUCE) in private benchmarking, and the challenges of decontamination (where minor text changes can bypass detection). Limitations such as the necessity for robust key management, susceptibility to key exposure, and computational overheads are also highlighted.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in the discussion is the trade-off between security and practicality: while encryption and related approaches provide strong confidentiality, they introduce new risks (key management, computational costs) and depend on the integrity of cryptographic primitives. The text also implies that even advanced decontamination is insufficient against clever attacks, suggesting encryption as a more reliable alternative. Label protection is contrasted as a lighter-weight solution focused on hiding answers rather than full data encryption.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 9/10.

Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) propose encrypting test data with a public key and a \u201cNo Derivatives\u201d license to block automated crawling and reuse. Yang et\u00a0al. (2023) show that even advanced decontamination methods can be defeated by minor text variations, emphasizing the need for robust encryption. Similarly, TRUCE (Chandran et\u00a0al., 2024) leverages confidential computing and secure multi-party computation to enable private benchmarking, ensuring that test data and model parameters remain confidential.\n\n\n###### Limitation\nWhile these methods effectively protect against data leakage, they depend on strong key management, they introduce extra computational overheads. These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment. This approach is common in benchmarks such as GLUE Wang (2018), SuperGLUE Wang et\u00a0al. (2019), and OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Chen et\u00a0al.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. Thoughtful Content Examination:\nThe context discusses strategies for protecting evaluation datasets in machine learning benchmarks, focusing on two major areas: encryption of evaluation data and label protection. Encryption, as described, involves securing evaluation data with cryptographic methods such as public-key encryption and confidential computing to prevent unauthorized access and accidental inclusion in training datasets. Limitations include dependencies on key management, computational overhead, and the risk of encryption compromise. Label protection, on the other hand, refers to the practice of withholding true test set labels from public access, a method adopted by prominent benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and HumanEval. This strategy is designed to maintain evaluation integrity by preventing answer leakage, which could otherwise lead to data contamination and unreliable benchmarking.\n\n2. Concept Exploration:\nThe text assumes that exposure to test labels or data can compromise the reliability of benchmark evaluations due to potential model contamination. It highlights the challenge that even decontamination techniques may fail if data is slightly altered, underscoring the necessity for robust protection. The underlying theory is that benchmark credibility relies on the strict separation of evaluation data from training data and model developers. The practical application is demonstrated by major benchmarks adopting label protection as a core protocol.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty is rated at 9/10. While the basics of label protection are straightforward, the nuanced implications for benchmark integrity, the contrast with encryption, and the subtle vulnerabilities involved require expert-level comprehension. A challenging question would require the test-taker to reason about the comparative strengths and limitations of these strategies, and their nuanced role in maintaining evaluation integrity.\n\n4.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**\n   - The context discusses the critical need to account for complexity in dynamic benchmarks for LLMs. It highlights that performance drops may be due to increased complexity rather than data contamination. The text identifies that measuring dataset complexity is inherently difficult, and existing metrics are often tailored to specific domains, lacking generalizability. The example of DyVal using graph complexity for reasoning tasks underlines the specificity of certain metrics.\n2. **Concept Exploration**\n   - There is an implicit assumption that complexity is a multi-faceted construct, not easily captured by a single universal metric. The mention of \"variance in complexity\" introduces the idea of stability in benchmarking, suggesting that inconsistency in complexity measurement can undermine the reliability of dynamic benchmarks. The underlying challenge is the absence of a domain-agnostic metric, which limits cross-domain benchmarking and comparison.\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**\n   - Difficulty: 9/10. The question should probe a deep understanding of why complexity metrics fail to generalize, the consequences for benchmarking, and perhaps encourage consideration of theoretical or practical ramifications.\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**\n   - To ensure the question inspires meaningful reflection, it should require the expert to distinguish subtle but critical limitations of generalizing complexity metrics, potentially drawing on the difference between domain-specific characteristics and the requirements for stable, fair benchmarking across domains.

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

First, static benchmarks become less effective as training corpora grow.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n",

Concept Exploration:\nImplicit in the discussion is the assumption that static benchmarks cannot keep pace with the rapid growth and opacity of LLM training data. Label protection relates to the transparency of benchmarks, as undisclosed or hidden labels can hinder reproducibility and trust in the results.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context highlights the challenge of detecting contamination (overlap) in LLM training datasets due to legal and privacy restrictions that often prevent full access to training data. This directly impairs post-hoc detection methods, which typically rely on such access. Furthermore, model-based heuristics (like memorization or perplexity) are unreliable across models/tasks. The context then introduces dynamic benchmarking, which attempts to address contamination by continually transforming evaluation data via a function T(\u00b7), thereby obviating the need to know the training set contents. The dynamic benchmark is formalized mathematically, showing that at each timestamp t, the evaluation set is a transformation of the original data, potentially sidestepping the overlap issue.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: Implicitly, the context assumes that legal/privacy constraints will persist, necessitating solutions that do not require direct training data access. It suggests that dynamic benchmarking, by constantly refreshing evaluation data, reduces the risk of contamination\u2014thus, the reliability of evaluation is less dependent on the ability to check for overlaps.

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

Specifically, it points out that (a) legal and privacy constraints may limit full access to the training data, which makes overlap detection (i.e., finding contaminated instances) difficult, and (b) the behavioral assumptions that contaminated data will result in higher memorization or lower perplexity may not generalize across models and tasks.

Concept Exploration:\nA key implicit assumption is that post-hot detection methods rely on observable model behaviors or direct data overlap, but both are hindered in practice by data inaccessibility and by non-universal behavioral signals. The text further implies that dynamic benchmarking may circumvent some contamination issues by constantly evolving the evaluation dataset, thus reducing the likelihood that the model has seen evaluation data during training.\n\nThere's an underlying tension: post-hot detection is reactive (detecting after-the-fact contamination), while dynamic benchmarking is proactive (preventing contamination by design). The limitations of post-hot detection suggest that even with advanced behavioral analysis, the inability to access full datasets or rely on model behaviors limits detection reliability.\n\n3. Strategic Complexity Calibration:\nDifficulty: 9/10. The question should demand not only knowledge of post-hot detection methods but also a nuanced understanding of why their assumptions break down and how these limitations relate to the need for dynamic benchmarking.\n\n4. Intentional Question Planning:\nThe question will probe the expert's ability to synthesize why post-hot detection is fundamentally limited in LLM settings and what underlying factors (legal, privacy, model behavior) make these limitations particularly acute.

Although retrieval-based detection methods\u00a0Team et\u00a0al. (2024); Achiam et\u00a0al.

This overlap undermines the integrity of model assessment. Pre-training on vast, indiscriminate web data increases the likelihood that evaluation examples are included, either directly or in close paraphrase. Post-training fine-tuning (on human-annotated or synthetic data) can also mimic evaluation tasks, compounding the risk.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

The narrative points out that tracing training data is challenging, making contamination detection difficult.

Notably, it identifies a gap in the literature: while there are reviews on post-hoc contamination detection, no prior systematic survey exists for dynamic benchmarking methods or for criteria to evaluate such benchmarks. The authors claim to address this gap by proposing evaluation criteria for dynamic benchmarks and note that current dynamic benchmarks do not yet fully satisfy these criteria.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**  \nThe text implicitly assumes that reliable evaluation of LLMs requires both the minimization of data contamination and the establishment of robust, standardized criteria for benchmarks themselves. There is an undercurrent of urgency regarding the need for transparent, adaptable, and contamination-resistant evaluation methods, and the context suggests that the field lacks a consensus or standardization in how dynamic benchmarks should be assessed for effectiveness or reliability.

Static benchmarks are seen as inadequate due to issues of transparency and faithfulness, especially in the context of data contamination. Dynamic benchmarks, in contrast, involve a transformation function \\( T(\\cdot) \\) applied to a seed dataset \\( \\mathcal{D} \\) to generate a new evaluation dataset at each timestamp \\( t \\), denoted \\( \\mathcal{D}_t = T_t(\\mathcal{D}) \\). Importantly, the text highlights the scenario where the seed dataset \\( \\mathcal{D} \\) is empty, necessitating the construction of the dynamic benchmarking dataset \"from scratch.\" This introduces unique methodological and practical challenges.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**  \nThe key implicit assumption is that dynamic benchmarking can function even in the absence of any initial data, but this requires a principled approach to dataset generation. Important underlying themes include the necessity for the transformation function to generate valid, representative, and unbiased data without relying on prior examples. The construction \"from scratch\" raises questions about ensuring representativeness, avoiding bias, and maintaining evaluation faithfulness. Furthermore, the process must avoid overlap with any model training data to prevent contamination, which is especially challenging when no seed data is available to guide the generation process.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**  \nThis topic is highly technical, requiring understanding of data generation theory, benchmarking methodology, and the constraints of LLM evaluation.
