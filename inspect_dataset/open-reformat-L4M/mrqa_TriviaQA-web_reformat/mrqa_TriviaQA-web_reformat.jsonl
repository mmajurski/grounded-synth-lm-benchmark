    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen English counties and cover 9.3% of England, with no national park in the central counties. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land. The Lake District National Park at  is the largest National Park in England and second largest in the United Kingdom after Scotland's Cairngorms National Park. Snowdonia National Park, at ,",

That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. [PAR] Image via Fred Espenak [PAR] Deneb is one of the most distant stars you will see with your eye alone. That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The exact distance to Deneb is unclear, with estimates ranging from about 1,425 light-years to perhaps as much as 7,000 light-years. Whatever its exact distance, when you gaze at Deneb, know that you are gazing across thousands of light-years of space. [PAR] The best estimates for Deneb\u2019s distance likely are those obtained by the Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission in the 1990s. A simple calculation from initial Hipparcos data gives the figure of 3,230 light-years, whereas the refined data yield just over 1,400 light-years. At any of these estimates distances, Deneb is one of the farthest stars the unaided human eye can see. It is so far, that the light that reaches the Earth today started on its journey well more than 1,000 years ago. [PAR] Deneb (bottom half of frame) is 200 times bigger than the sun. Image via AstroBob [PAR] In order for us to see it at its enormous distance, Deneb must also be tremendously bright and energetic. Among the 20 brightest stars, only Rigel in Orion surpasses Deneb in intrinsic brightness. Deneb is an A2Ia star, which says that it is white hot (A2) and a supergiant star (Ia). Prof. James Kaler, using the figure of 2,600 light years as the distance, estimated a diameter 200 times greater than our sun, and about a quarter of a million times brighter in visible light. Considering its spectral classification (A2), Deneb must have a surface temperature between about 8500 to 9000 kelvins (roughly 14,800 to 15,700 degrees F). [PAR] This is the famous Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, which shows the luminosities of stars.  See Deneb at the top of the diagram?  It is one of the most luminous stars known. [PAR] Deneb is not the biggest star in the Milky Way. Betelgeuse and Antares , among others, are larger. But Deneb may well be the most energetic (based on the amount of electromagnetic radiation it produces) of the A-type stars. The famed North American nebula, a large cloud of glowing gas in the shape of the continent, likely is glowing in a process similar to fluorescence, energized by the radiation of Deneb. [PAR] Stellar luminosity: The true brightnesses of stars [PAR] How to see it [PAR] White Deneb is the 20th brightest star in the sky. It is one of the most remote stars visible to the eye alone. You can gaze at this faraway star starting in late spring, when Deneb rises over the northeastern horizon by mid-evening. A month later, Deneb is already in the sky by the time it gets dark. In standard time, the midnight culmination date is about August 1. Using Daylight Time, the midnight culmination is about August 15. The word \u2018culmination\u2019 indicates the star\u2019s highest point in the sky. [PAR] Deneb is part of several famous star patterns, which overlap each other. It\u2019s the brightest of the stars composing the constellation Cygnus the Swan, where it marks the Swan\u2019s Tail. When you hear \u2018deneb\u2019 in a star name, it always means \u2018tail.\u2019 Simultaneously, Deneb marks the head of an asterism (a readily recognizable grouping of stars that is not an official constellation), known as the Northern Cross. Plus it is one of the three stars known as the Summer Triangle . The other two stars are Vega and Altair . Deneb is the northernmost and dimmest of the three Triangle stars, but its association with the other bright stars makes it easy to identify. [PAR] Deneb is circumpolar as seen from locations of",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Harry PotterHarry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and non-magical people (Muggles). [PAR] Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 30 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.  The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. , the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release. [PAR] The series was originally published in English by two major publishers, Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. A play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, based on a story by Rowling, premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre, and its script was published by Little, Brown as the eighth book in the series.  The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which has become the second highest-grossing film series of all time . The franchise has also generated much tie-in merchandise, making the Harry Potter brand worth in excess of $15\u00a0billion.  [PAR] A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death.  Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness. [PAR] The success of the books and films has ensured that the Harry Potter franchise continues to expand, with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premi\u00e8red in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a trilogy of spin-off films premi\u00e8ring in November 2016, among many other developments. Most recently, themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.

The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation, that lies ahead, in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.

The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice.

Founded by Canadian environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace states its goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity\"  and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants.   Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  and is a founding member  of the INGO Accountability Charter; an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations. [PAR] Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world.   Greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge,    and influenced both the private and the public sector.   Greenpeace has also been a source of controversy;  its motives and methods (some of the latter being illegal) have received criticism,  including an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The organization's direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists,   such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat[http://www.biofortified.org/2013/06/gmo-crops-vandalized-in-oregon/ GMO crops vandalized in Oregon], Karl Haro von Mogel, Biology Fortified, 24 June 2013. and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site in Peru.  [PAR] History [PAR] Origins [PAR] In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000  people blocked a major U.S.\u2013Canadian border crossing in British Columbia, carrying signs reading \"Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes\".  The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb. [PAR] While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opposers were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. As members of the Sierra Club Canada, they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization. From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, \"bearing witness\", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence. Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club. The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay St. became the HQ.  As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, Greenpeace, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's \"quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance\". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.  Within half a year Greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in Kitsilano.

Dickens and his illustrator Hablot Browne        (phiz) traveled incognito to Yorkshire on a fact-finding mission in        January 1838. There they encountered William Shaw, headmaster of Bowes Academy,        in whose school several boys had died or went blind from mistreatment and        neglect. [PAR] Visiting a cemetery in the area Dickens found the graves of many of the        students of these schools and one in particular Dickens said \"put Smike        into my head\". Smike was the abused inmate of Dotheboys Hall, the fictional        school he based on Shaw's Bowes Academy in Nicholas Nickleby.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Equator, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of CapricornThe Equator, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] By Matt Rosenberg [PAR] Updated August 31, 2016. [PAR] Three of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer.. [PAR] Prime Meridian [PAR] While the equator divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres , it is the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude and the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian (near the International Date Line ) at 180 degrees longitude that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres . The Eastern Hemisphere consists of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia while the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America . Some geographers place the boundaries between the hemispheres at 20\u00b0 West and 160\u00b0 East so as to not run through Europe and Africa. Unlike the equator and the Tropic of Cancer and",

The descendant of Viking raiders, he had been Duke of Normandy since 1035. After a long struggle to establish his power, by 1060 his hold on Normandy was secure, and he launched the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son. [PAR] William was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine. [PAR] In the 1050s and early 1060s William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, who was named the next king by Edward on the latter's deathbed in January 1066. William argued that Edward had previously promised the throne to him, and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066, decisively defeating and killing Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but by 1075 William's hold on England was mostly secure, allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent. [PAR] William's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, a survey listing all the landholders in England along with their holdings. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire, but instead continued to administer each part separately. William's lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to his eldest son, Robert, and his second surviving son, William, received England. [PAR] Background  [PAR] Norsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement surrendering the county of Rouen to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy.Collins Early Medieval Europe pp. 376\u2013377 Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 42\u201343 In an effort to improve matters, King \u00c6thelred the Unready took Emma of Normandy, sister of Duke Richard II, as his second wife in 1002.Williams \u00c6thelred the Unready pp. 54\u201355 [PAR] Danish raids on England continued,",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Napoleon Bonaparte - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.comNapoleon Bonaparte - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com [PAR] Google [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Education and Early Military Career [PAR] Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio, on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon\u2019s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 1799, during Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt, a French soldier named Pierre Francois Bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the Rosetta Stone. This artifact provided the key to cracking the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years. [PAR] As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. [PAR] In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. [PAR] In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general. [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Rise to Power [PAR] Since 1792, France\u2019s revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various European nations. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria, one of his country\u2019s primary rivals, in a series of battles in Italy. In 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French. [PAR] The following year, the Directory, the five-person group that had governed France since 1795, offered to let Napoleon lead an invasion of England. Napoleon determined that France\u2019s naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior British Royal Navy. Instead, he proposed an invasion of Egypt in an effort to wipe out British trade routes with India. Napoleon\u2019s troops scored a victory against Egypt\u2019s military rulers, the Mamluks, at the Battle of the Pyramids in July 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the British at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. In early 1799, Napoleon\u2019s army launched an invasion of Ottoman-ruled Syria, which ended with the failed siege of Acre, located in modern-day Israel. That summer, with the political situation in France marked by uncertainty, the ever-ambitious and cunning Napoleon opted to abandon his army in Egypt and return to France.

Each letter in Scrabble has its own value, while certain points on a Scrabble board are worth more points than others. Finally, there are a few special circumstances where Scrabble scoring differs than in other points of the game. [PAR] Scrabble Letter Tiles \u2013 Point Values [PAR] Below is a table showing the point values of each tile in Scrabble. I\u2019ll include a table to show how many of each letter exists in a standard Scrabble game, as well. When you play one of these letter tiles on the Scrabble board, you get the point value indicated on the letter tile. [PAR] Scrabble Point Distribution [PAR] A \u2013 E \u2013 I \u2013 O \u2013 - U \u2013 L \u2013 N \u2013 R \u2013 S \u2013 T = 1 point [PAR] D \u2013 G = 2 points [PAR] B \u2013 C \u2013 M \u2013 P = 3 points [PAR] F \u2013 H \u2013 W \u2013 Y \u2013 V = 4 points [PAR] K = 5 points [PAR] J \u2013 X  = 8 points [PAR] Q \u2013 Z = 10 points [PAR] The following table shows how many of each letters there are in a standard game of Scrabble. In all, there are 100 tiles to play in any given Scrabble game. [PAR] Scrabble Letter Distribution [PAR] 1: J \u2013 K \u2013 X \u2013 Q \u2013 Z [PAR] 2: B \u2013 C \u2013 F \u2013 H \u2013 M \u2013 P \u2013 W \u2013 Y \u2013 V \u2013 Blank Tiles [PAR] 3: G [PAR] 4: D \u2013 L \u2013 S \u2013 U [PAR] 6: N \u2013 R \u2013 T [PAR] 10: E [PAR] Double and Triple Scores [PAR] When any of the letters of a word you place on the board covers a double or triple score, apply that modifier to your word score. If it\u2019s a double or triple letter score, only modify the score for the letter on that tile. If it\u2019s a double or triple word score, add up the score for all the tiles and then multiply the amount by the modifier. [PAR] If you happen to cross two or more modifiers with your word, apply all of them. If you cross a triple letter score and a double word score, then multiple the triple score letter by x3 and then multiple the whole word score by x2. If you happen to cross two word multipliers, then remember to multiple the word score by both values. In this way, scores can reach large numbers. [PAR] There is a limiting factor to the scores made by these tiles, though. That\u2019s because, once used, these tiles can\u2019t be reused for the purposes of multipliers. [PAR] Reusing Double and Triple Scores [PAR] After a double-word or triple-word score has been used and figured, that space will not be worth a double- or triple-word score again in the game. The same goes for double-letter and triple-letter scores. [PAR] For example, imagine that a letter tile saying double-word score, like the one you play off of at the beginning of the game, is \u201cactivated\u201d at the beginning of the game. Whoever plays off that tile first gets a double-word score. But the next player who builds a word off that same letter does not get a double-word score. This rule is there for several purposes, but it keeps people from simply beating opponents by playing an -s or -ed or -ing at the end of words on the board. You can still do so, but you won\u2019t score as many points (or more) if the original word played involved double- or triple-word scoring. [PAR] 50 Point Bonus [PAR] If at any time, you use all 7 tiles in your rack one on play, you get an automatic 50 point bonus. This does not apply in the endgame scenario when you have less than 7 letters on your rack, of course. [PAR] Final Scores in Scrabble [PAR] Who \u201cgoes out\u201d also has a big affect on the score.",

He studied the literature of socialism , notably Karl Marx and Vladimir I. Lenin, and of nationalism , especially Marcus Garvey , the black American leader of the 1920s. Eventually, Nkrumah came to describe himself as a \u201cnondenominational Christian and a Marxist socialist.\u201d He also immersed himself in political work, reorganizing and becoming president of the African Students\u2019 Organization of the United States and Canada. He left the United States in May 1945 and went to England, where he organized the 5th Pan-African Congress in Manchester. [PAR] Meanwhile, in the Gold Coast, J.B.

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village.

The series is a satirical depiction of a working class lifestyle epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and many aspects of the human condition. It's the 20th Century Fox debut in animation. [PAR] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390). [PAR] Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the series has broadcast  episodes. It will begin airing its 28th season in September 2016. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American scripted primetime television series. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. On May 4, 2015, the series was officially renewed for seasons twenty-seven (2015\u201316) and twenty-eight (2016\u201317), consisting of 22 episodes each.   [PAR] The Simpsons has received widespread critical acclaim, especially for the \"Golden Age\" of approximately its first ten seasons. Time magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,  and The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\".   On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms. Despite this, the show has also been criticized for what many perceive as a decline in quality over the years. [PAR] Premise [PAR] Characters [PAR] The Simpsons are a family who live in a fictional \"Middle American\" town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.  The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\".  Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. [PAR] The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV.

He gained a reputation as a swaggering militarist through his speeches and ill-advised newspaper interviews. While Wilhelm did not actively seek war, and tried to hold back his generals from mobilizing the German army in the summer of 1914, his verbal outbursts and his open enjoyment of the title of Supreme War Lord helped bolster the case of those who blamed him for the conflict. His role in the conduct of the war as well as his responsibility for its outbreak is still controversial. Some historians maintain that Wilhelm was controlled by his generals, while others argue that he retained considerable political power. In late 1918, he was forced to abdicate. He spent the rest of his life in exile in the Netherlands, where he died at age 82. [PAR] Google [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s Early Years [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was born in Potsdam, Germany, on January 27, 1859, the son of Prince Frederick Wilhelm of Prussia (1831-88) and Princess Victoria (1840-1901), the oldest daughter of Queen Victoria of England (1819-1901). The future monarch was the queen\u2019s firstborn grandchild and was genuinely fond of her; in fact, he was holding her in his arms when she died. His ties to Britain through its royal family would play an important part in his later political maneuvering. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Kaiser Wilhelm II was reportedly amused when he heard his cousin King George V (1865-1936) had changed the name of the British royal family from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor in 1917 as a result of anti-German sentiment in Britain during World War I. [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s childhood was shaped by two events, one medical and one political. His birth had been traumatic; in the course of a complicated delivery, the doctor permanently damaged Wilhelm\u2019s left arm. In addition to its smaller size, the arm was useless for such ordinary tasks as cutting certain foods with a knife at mealtime. [PAR] The political event that shaped Wilhelm was the formation of the German Empire under the leadership of Prussia in 1871. Wilhelm was now second in line after his father to become an emperor as well as king of Prussia. Twelve years old at the time, Wilhelm was filled with nationalistic enthusiasm. His later determination to win a \u201cplace in the sun\u201d for Germany had its roots in his childhood. [PAR] An intelligent young man who possessed a lifelong interest in science and technology, Wilhelm was educated at the University of Bonn. His quick mind, however, was combined with an even quicker temper and an impulsive, high-strung personality. He had dysfunctional relationships with both parents, particularly his English mother. Historians still debate the effects of the kaiser\u2019s complicated psychological makeup on his political decisions. [PAR] In 1881, Wilhelm married Princess Augusta Victoria (1858-1921) of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple would go on to have seven children. [PAR] Emperor and King: 1888 [PAR] Wilhelm\u2019s father became Kaiser Frederick III of Germany in March 1888. Already ill with terminal throat cancer, he died after a reign of only several months. Wilhelm succeeded his father on June 15, 1888, at the age of 29. Within two years of his coronation, Wilhelm broke with Otto von Bismarck (1815-98), the \u201cIron Chancellor\u201d who had dominated German politics since the 1860s. The kaiser embarked on his so-called New Course, a period of personal rule in which he appointed chancellors who were upper-level civil servants rather than statesmen. Bismarck bitterly predicted that Wilhelm would lead Germany to ruin. [PAR] Wilhelm damaged his political position in a number of ways. He meddled in German foreign policy on the basis of his emotions, resulting in incoherence and inconsistency in German relations with other nations. He also made a number of public",

[PAR] Pink Marble: A piece of pink marble about four inches (ten centimeters) across. The pink color is most likely derived from iron. Image by NASA. [PAR] What is Marble? [PAR] Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism.  It is composed primarily of the mineral calcite (CaCO3) and usually contains other minerals, such as clay minerals, micas, quartz , pyrite , iron oxides, and graphite . Under the conditions of metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone recrystallizes to form a rock that is a mass of interlocking calcite crystals. A related rock, dolomitic marble, is produced when dolostone is subjected to heat and pressure. [PAR] \u00a0 Photo Gallery: \u00a0 The Many Uses of Marble [PAR] Ruby in Marble: Marble is often the host rock for corundum, spinel, and other gem minerals. This specimen is a piece of white marble with a large red ruby crystal from Afghanistan. Specimen is about 1 1/4 inches across (about 3 centimeters). Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] How Does Marble Form? [PAR] Most marble forms at convergent plate boundaries where large areas of Earth's crust are exposed to regional metamorphism.  Some marble also forms by contact metamorphism when a hot magma body heats adjacent limestone or dolostone. [PAR] Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris.   During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes.  In the early stages of the  limestone-to-marble transformation, the calcite crystals in the rock are very small.  In a freshly-broken hand  specimen, they might only be recognized as a sugary sparkle of light reflecting from their tiny cleavage faces when the rock is played in the light. [PAR] As metamorphism progresses, the crystals grow larger and become easily recognizable as interlocking crystals of calcite.   Recrystallization obscures the original fossils and sedimentary structures of the limestone. It also occurs without forming  foliation, which normally is found in rocks that are altered by the directed pressure of a convergent plate boundary. [PAR] Recrystallization is what marks the separation between limestone and marble.  Marble that has been exposed to low levels of metamorphism will have very small calcite crystals.  The crystals become larger as the level of metamorphism progresses. Clay minerals within the marble will alter to micas and more complex silicate structures as the level of metamorphism increases. [PAR] Marble Dimension Stone: Marble cut into blocks and slabs of specific size is known as \"dimension stone.\"  Photo \u00a9 iStockphoto / Thomas Lehmann. [PAR] Physical Properties and Uses of Marble [PAR] Marble occurs in large deposits that can be hundreds of feet thick and geographically extensive.  This allows it to be  economically mined on a large scale, with some mines and quarries producing millions of tons per year. [PAR] Most marble is made into either crushed stone or dimension stone. Crushed stone is used as an aggregate in highways, railroad beds, building foundations, and other types of construction. Dimension stone is produced by sawing marble into  pieces of specific dimensions.   These are used in monuments, buildings, sculptures, paving and other projects.  We have an article about  \" the uses of marble \" that includes photos and descriptions of marble in many types of uses. [PAR] Gray Marble: This specimen has calcite cleavage faces up to several millimeters in size that are reflecting light.  The specimen is about two inches (five centimeters) across. [PAR] Calcium carbonate medicines: Marble is composed of calcium carbonate. That makes it very effective at neutralizing acids.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] William ShakespeareWilliam Shakespeare (;  26 April 1564 (baptised)\u00a0\u2013 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.; ; . He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.  [PAR] Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.  [PAR] Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.  His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. [PAR] Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as \"not of an age, but for all time\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 1168  [PAR] In the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular, and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world. [PAR] Life [PAR] Early life [PAR] William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.  He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26\u00a0April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23\u00a0April, Saint George's Day.  This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, because Shakespeare died on 23\u00a0April 1616.  He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.  [PAR] Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,  a free school chartered in 1553,  about a quarter-mile (400\u00a0m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,  and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.  [PAR] At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27\u00a0November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that",

Peleg tells them of the new captain, Ahab, and immediately describes him as a grand and ungodly man. Before leaving for their voyage, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a stranger named Elijah who predicts disaster on their journey. Before leaving on the Pequod, Elijah again predicts disaster. [PAR] Ishmael and Queequeg board the Pequod, where Captain Ahab is still unseen, secluded in his own cabin. Peleg and Bildad consult with Starbuck , the first mate. He is a Quaker and a Nantucket native who is quite practical. The second mate is Stubb , a Cape Cod native with a more jovial and carefree attitude. The third is Flask , a Martha's Vineyard native with a pugnacious attitude. Melville introduces the rest of the crew, including the Indian harpooner Tashtego , the African harpooner Daggoo . [PAR] Several days into the voyage, Ahab finally appears as a man seemingly made of bronze who stands on an ivory leg fashioned from whalebone. He eventually gets into a violent argument with Stubb when the second mate makes a joke at Ahab's expense, and kicks him. This leads Stubb to dream of kicking Ahab's ivory leg off, but Flask claims that the kick from Ahab is a sign of honor. [PAR] At last, Ahab tells the crew of the Pequod to look for a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow: Moby Dick, the legendary whale that took Ahab's leg. Starbuck tells Ahab that his obsession with Moby Dick is madness, but Ahab claims that all things are masks and there is some unknown reasoning behind that mask that man must strike through. For Ahab, Moby Dick is that mask. Ahab himself seems to recognize his own madness. Starbuck begins to worry that the ship is overmatched by the mad captain and knows that he will see an impious end to Ahab. [PAR] While Queequeg and Ishmael weave a sword-mat for lashing to their boat, the Pequod soon comes upon a whale and Ahab orders his crew to their boats. Ahab orders his special crew, which Ishmael compares to \"phantoms,\" to their boats. The crew attacks a whale and Queequeg does strike it, but this is insufficient to kill it. Among the \"phantoms\" in the boat is Fedallah , a sinister Parsee. [PAR] After passing the Cape of Good Hope, the Pequod comes across the Goney (Albatross), another ship on its voyage. Ahab asks whether they have seen Moby Dick as the ships pass one another, but Ahab cannot hear his answer. The mere passing of the ships is unorthodox behavior, for ships will generally have a 'gam,",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is an English Christmas carol that enumerates in the manner of a cumulative song a series of increasingly grand gifts given on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days after Christmas). The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin. \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68. The tunes of collected versions vary. The standard tune now associated with it is derived from a 1909 arrangement of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin, who first introduced the now familiar prolongation of the verse \"five gold rings\". [PAR] Lyrics  [PAR] \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses. There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by \"my true love\" on one of the twelve days of Christmas. [PAR] There are many variations in the lyrics. The lyrics given here are from Austin's 1909 publication that first established the current form of the carol.   The first three verses run, in full, as follows: [PAR] Subsequent verses follow the same pattern, each adding one new gift and repeating all the earlier gifts, so that each verse is one line longer than its predecessor: [PAR] 4 Calling Birds  [PAR] 5 Gold Rings  [PAR] 6 Geese a-Laying [PAR] 7 Swans a-Swimming [PAR] 8 Maids a-Milking [PAR] 9 Ladies Dancing [PAR] 10 Lords a-Leaping [PAR] 11 Pipers Piping [PAR] 12 Drummers Drumming [PAR] Variations of the lyrics  [PAR] The earliest known version of the lyrics was published under the title \"The Twelve Days of Christmas sung at King Pepin's Ball\", as part of a 1780 children's book, Mirth without Mischief.  Subsequent versions have shown considerable variation: [PAR] * In the earliest versions, the word \"On\" is not present at the beginning of each verse\u2014for example, the first verse begins simply \"The first day of Christmas\".  \"On\" was added in Austin's 1909 version, and became very popular thereafter. [PAR] * In the early versions \"my true love sent\" me the gifts. However, a 20th-century variant has \"my true love gave to me\"; this wording has become particularly common in North America.  [PAR] * The 1780 version has \"four colly birds\"\u2014\"colly\" being a regional English expression for \"black\".   This wording must have been opaque to many even in the 19th century: \"canary birds\", \"colour'd birds\", \"curley birds\", and \"corley birds\" are found in its place.  Frederic Austin's 1909 version, which introduced the now-standard melody, also altered the fourth day's gift to four \"calling\" birds, and this variant has become the most popular, although \"colly\" is still found. [PAR] * The \"five gold rings\" may become \"five golden rings\", especially in North America. In the standard melody, this change enables singers to fit one syllable per musical note.  [PAR] * The gifts associated with the final four days are often reordered.  For example, the pipers may be on the ninth day rather than the eleventh.

It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell & Co. [PAR] Treasure Island is traditionally considered a coming-of-age story, and is noted for its atmosphere, characters, and action. It is also noted as a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality\u2014as seen in Long John Silver\u2014unusual for children's literature. It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels. Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements as treasure maps marked with an \"X\", schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.Cordingly, David (1995) Under the Black Flag: the romance and reality of life among the pirates; p.  7 [PAR] Plot summary [PAR] ; PART I\u2014\"THE OLD BUCCANEER\" [PAR] An old sailor, calling himself \"the captain\"\u2014real name \"Billy\" Bones\u2014comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow Inn on the west English coast during the mid-1700s, paying the innkeeper's son, Jim Hawkins, a few pennies to keep a lookout for a one-legged \"seafaring man.\" A seaman with intact legs shows up, frightening Billy\u2014who drinks far too much rum\u2014into a stroke, and Billy tells Jim that his former shipmates covet the contents of his sea chest. After a visit from yet another man, Billy has another stroke and dies; Jim and his mother (his father has also died just a few days before) unlock the sea chest, finding some money, a journal, and a map. The local physician, Dr. Livesey, deduces that the map is of an island where a deceased pirate\u2014Captain Flint\u2014buried a vast treasure.

And just before the island is sighted, Jim\u2014concealed in an apple barrel\u2014overhears Silver talking with two other crewmen. They are all former \"gentlemen o'fortune\" (pirates) in Flint's crew and have planned a mutiny.

This also helps them  remember that 1 half note is worth 2 beats (in 4/4 timing, which is  what they are usually working in when learning this). [PAR] Quarter Note (Crotchet) [PAR] The quarter note has become the  de facto standard 1 beat music note.  This has happened as the 4/4 time signature is the most popular (with  3/4 and 2/4 following close behind) and quarter notes have a duration of  1 in these time signatures. It is also roughly in the middle of the  most used notes in the Rhythm Tree ,  making the quarter note the ideal candidate for ensuring whole notes  don't become too long to count, and shorter, popular notes such as  eighth and sixteenth notes aren't impossible to count in terms of them  being fractions of a note. The quarter note changes from the half note  as it is filled in, as opposed to empty. [PAR] Eighth Note (Quaver) [PAR] The eighth note is worth \u00bd of a Quarter note. It may also be considered  as a one beat note in 3/8 and similar timings, the 8 on the bottom of  the time signature giving the clue that you are counting in eighth  notes. This is the first note in the rhythm tree to have a flag.  The flag is the name for the 'tail' added to the eighth note. Eighth  notes may be a single as shown on the left, or joined together with beams. [PAR] It is common to see eighth notes joined into sets of 2 to make one beat.  Eighth notes may also be grouped in 3s, 4s, 5s, or even 6s depending on  the time signature. Remember, however, that no matter how many eighth  notes are joined, each one is worth half a quarter note. [PAR] Sixteenth note (Semiquaver) [PAR] The",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo address this task, let's first analyze the given context and the question-answer pair provided.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context discusses various music note values and their durations, starting from the Double Whole Note (Breve) down to the Sixteenth note (Semiquaver). It explains how each note's duration is determined and how they relate to each other through the \"rhythm tree.\"\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The text delves into the specifics of different notes, their historical context, and how their durations are interrelated. It highlights that the Whole note is the longest note in general use today and explains the durations of Half, Quarter, Eighth, and Sixteenth notes relative to it.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The original question asks for the name given to 1/16th of the whole note. The answer provided is \"semiquaver.\" To calibrate complexity, we need to ensure the question is challenging yet answerable by a domain expert. Given that \"semiquaver\" is another term for a Sixteenth note, the question is relatively straightforward for someone familiar with music theory.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: To enhance the question's depth, we could rephrase it to encourage deeper understanding or critical engagement. For instance, asking about the relationship between different note values or the historical context of note values could invite more reflection.\n\nGiven the context and the original question-answer pair, let's rephrase and rewrite them according to the guidelines.\n\nThe original question is: \"In music, what is the name given to 1/16th of the whole note?\"\nThe original answer is: \"semiquaver\"\n\nTo rephrase, we consider the information given in the context about Sixteenth notes being equivalent to 1/16th of a Whole note.\n\nRephrased Question: \"What is the term used in music notation for a note that has a duration of one-sixteenth of a Whole note?\"\n\nThis rephrased question is semantically equivalent to the original but is more detailed and specific, making it clearer and more challenging.\n\nThe Correct Answer remains \"semiquaver.\"\n\nLet's verify that the rephrased question and answer adhere to the output format and guidelines.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the term used in music notation for a note that has a duration of one-sixteenth of a Whole note?\nExplanation: The term \"semiquaver\" is used because, in music notation, a Sixteenth note is equivalent to one-sixteenth of a Whole note, and \"semiquaver\" is the traditional term for a Sixteenth note.\nCorrect Answer: semiquaver\n</output_format>\n\nThis output is formatted as per the guidelines and maintains semantic equivalence with the original question and answer.

That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. [PAR] Image via Fred Espenak [PAR] Deneb is one of the most distant stars you will see with your eye alone. That\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The exact distance to Deneb is unclear, with estimates ranging from about 1,425 light-years to perhaps as much as 7,000 light-years. Whatever its exact distance, when you gaze at Deneb, know that you are gazing across thousands of light-years of space. [PAR] The best estimates for Deneb\u2019s distance likely are those obtained by the Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission in the 1990s. A simple calculation from initial Hipparcos data gives the figure of 3,230 light-years, whereas the refined data yield just over 1,400 light-years. At any of these estimates distances, Deneb is one of the farthest stars the unaided human eye can see. It is so far, that the light that reaches the Earth today started on its journey well more than 1,000 years ago. [PAR] Deneb (bottom half of frame) is 200 times bigger than the sun. Image via AstroBob [PAR] In order for us to see it at its enormous distance, Deneb must also be tremendously bright and energetic. Among the 20 brightest stars, only Rigel in Orion surpasses Deneb in intrinsic brightness. Deneb is an A2Ia star, which says that it is white hot (A2) and a supergiant star (Ia). Prof. James Kaler, using the figure of 2,600 light years as the distance, estimated a diameter 200 times greater than our sun, and about a quarter of a million times brighter in visible light. Considering its spectral classification (A2), Deneb must have a surface temperature between about 8500 to 9000 kelvins (roughly 14,800 to 15,700 degrees F). [PAR] This is the famous Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, which shows the luminosities of stars.  See Deneb at the top of the diagram?  It is one of the most luminous stars known. [PAR] Deneb is not the biggest star in the Milky Way. Betelgeuse and Antares , among others, are larger. But Deneb may well be the most energetic (based on the amount of electromagnetic radiation it produces) of the A-type stars. The famed North American nebula, a large cloud of glowing gas in the shape of the continent, likely is glowing in a process similar to fluorescence, energized by the radiation of Deneb. [PAR] Stellar luminosity: The true brightnesses of stars [PAR] How to see it [PAR] White Deneb is the 20th brightest star in the sky. It is one of the most remote stars visible to the eye alone. You can gaze at this faraway star starting in late spring, when Deneb rises over the northeastern horizon by mid-evening. A month later, Deneb is already in the sky by the time it gets dark. In standard time, the midnight culmination date is about August 1. Using Daylight Time, the midnight culmination is about August 15. The word \u2018culmination\u2019 indicates the star\u2019s highest point in the sky. [PAR] Deneb is part of several famous star patterns, which overlap each other. It\u2019s the brightest of the stars composing the constellation Cygnus the Swan, where it marks the Swan\u2019s Tail. When you hear \u2018deneb\u2019 in a star name, it always means \u2018tail.\u2019 Simultaneously, Deneb marks the head of an asterism (a readily recognizable grouping of stars that is not an official constellation), known as the Northern Cross.

The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931\u00a0BC, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. [PAR] According to the Talmud, Solomon is one of the 48 prophets.  In the Qur'an, he is considered a major prophet, and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman, son of David.  Solomon (Arabic \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 Sulaym\u0101n) was, according to the Qur'an, a king of ancient Israel as well as the son of David. The Qur'an recognizes Solomon as a prophet and a divinely-appointed monarch. Islamic tradition generally holds that Solomon was the third king of Israel and was a just and wise ruler for the nation.  [PAR] The Hebrew Bible credits him as the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem. It portrays him as great in wisdom, wealth, and power beyond any of the previous kings of the country, but ultimately as a human king who sinned. His sins included idolatry and turning away from Yahweh, and led to the kingdom's being torn in two during the reign of his son Rehoboam.  Solomon is the subject of many other later references and legends, most notably in the 1st-century apocryphal work known as the Testament of Solomon. In later years, in mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.  [PAR] Biblical account [PAR] Childhood [PAR] Solomon was born in Jerusalem,  the second born child to David and his wife Bathsheba, widow of Uriah the Hittite. The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah's lifetime, had died before Solomon was conceived as a punishment by Yahweh on account of the death of Uriah by David's order. Solomon had three named full brothers through Bathsheba, Nathan, Shammua, and Shobab,  besides six known older half-brothers through as many mothers.  [PAR] Succession and administration [PAR] According to the First Book of Kings, when David was old, \"he could not get warm.\"  \"So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.\" [PAR] While David was in this state, court factions were maneuvering for power. David's heir apparent, Adonijah, acted to have himself declared king, but was outmaneuvered by Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan, who convinced David to proclaim Solomon king according to his earlier promise, despite Solomon being younger than his brothers. [PAR] Solomon, as instructed by David, began his reign with an extensive purge, including his father's chief general, Joab, among others, and further consolidated his position by appointing friends throughout the administration, including in religious positions as well as in civic and military posts. [PAR] Solomon greatly expanded his military strength, especially the cavalry and chariot arms. He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts. [PAR] Trade relationships were a focus of his administration.

Amongst these were seven of the above colours, the purpose of which was to provide a guide to selecting appropriate shades.

In 1949 it published the Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration , which is discussed in another post.

The screenplay itself departed from the book in a number of details (e.g. Frank Burns became a major instead of a captain, and was identified with Major Hobson, the zealously religious officer that Pierce and bunk mate Trapper John McIntyre got removed from their tent and, subsequently, the camp), but on the whole, the main characters and mood were left intact. [PAR] Perhaps the biggest change in Hawkeye's characterization from the book, to the big screen and finally to the small screen comes in his marital status. The Hawkeye of the book is married to Evelyn Pierce with children (according to the sequels) and faithful while in Korea (as far as the reader is concerned). He offers several doctors love advice, \"Jeeter\" Carroll for example, extolling the virtues of extramarital sex but never partaking himself. The film version of Hawkeye is still married, but gives himself more moral leeway, arguing that he is far from home, no one is ever going to know, and it will reduce stress for both involved. [PAR] Finally, the film's Hawkeye was transformed into the womanizing and single Hawkeye of the TV series. In the pilot, however, Hawkeye told Lieutenant Dish that he was engaged and in a later first-season episode he broke up with several women, when he believed the war had ended",

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus. He caused Agamemnon to dream of victory by aggressively moving his army forward. Agamemnon tried this and was met by Hector, the brother of Paris. A fight between Paris and Menelaus was suggested. The two faced each other in the",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] History of Massachusetts: The Salem Witch TrialsHistory of the Salem Witch Trials \u2013 History of Massachusetts Blog [PAR] \u00a0\u00a0 70 Comments on History of the Salem Witch Trials [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials of 1692 were a dark time in American history. More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 were killed during the hysteria. [PAR] Ever since those dark days ended, the trials have become synonymous with mass hysteria and scapegoating. The following are some facts about the Salem Witch Trials: [PAR] What Were the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials were a series of witchcraft cases brought before local magistrates in a settlement called Salem which was a part of the Massachusetts Bay colony in the 17th century. [PAR] When Exactly Did the Salem Witch Trials Take Place? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials officially began in February of 1692, when the afflicted girls accused the first three victims, Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchcraft and ended in May of 1693, when the remaining victims were released from jail. [PAR] What Caused the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials was a classic example of scapegoating. Fear combined with a \u201ctrigger,\u201d a traumatic or stressful event, is what often leads to scapegoating. Fear of the Devil, and witches who did his bidding, was very real in Salem at the time. [PAR] In Massachusetts during the 17th century , people often feared that the Devil was constantly trying to find ways to infiltrate and destroy Christians and their communities. [PAR] As a devout and strongly religious community living in near isolation in the mysterious New World, the community of Salem had a heightened sense of fear of the Devil and then experienced a \u201ctrigger\u201d when Tituba, one of the accused witches, confessed that she and others were in fact witches working for the Devil. [PAR] This induced panic and hysteria and quickly sparked a massive witch hunt. The fact is, although there were many other contributing factors, Tituba\u2019s confession is the main reason why the Salem Witch Trials happened. [PAR] The Massachusetts Bay colonists had accused and convicted people of witchcraft before, starting with Margaret Jones in 1648, but nobody in the colony had ever confessed to being a witch before or ominously stated that there were other witches out there. Tituba\u2019s simple confession reinforced all of the colonist\u2019s underlying fears. [PAR] \u201cThe Witch, No. 1,\u201d lithograph by Joseph E. Baker, published by George H. Walker & Co, circa 1892 [PAR] In addition to this constant sense of fear, Salem residents were also under a great deal of stress during this period due to a number of factors. [PAR] One major factor was that in 1684, King Charles II revoked the Massachusetts Bay Colony\u2019s royal charter, a legal document granting the colonists permission to colonize the area. [PAR] The charter was revoked because the colonists had violated several of the charter\u2019s rules, which included basing laws on religious beliefs and discriminating against Anglicans. [PAR] Charles II died shortly after and James II replaced him and merged the Massachusetts Bay Colony into the Dominion of New England which instituted a royally-appointed government with many strict new laws. In 1689, after the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, the Massachusetts Bay colonists overthrew the unpopular Dominion of New England. [PAR] In 1691, the new King and Queen of England, Mary and William of Orange, issued a new, more anti-religious charter, instead of reissuing the old charter, and also combined the Massachusetts Bay Colony , Plymouth Colony and several other colonies into one. The new charter and regime basically continued the policies of the Dominion of New England. [PAR] The puritans, who had left England due to religious persecution, feared their religion was under attack again and worried they were losing control of their colony. The political instability and threat to their religion created a feeling of uneasiness and discontent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [PAR] Other factors included a recent small pox epidemic in the colony, growing rivalries between families within the colony, a constant threat of attack from nearby Native-American tribes, and a recent influx of refugees trying to escape King William\u2019s war with France in Canada and upstate New York.

The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.\u00a0 Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.\u00a0 The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.\u00a0 The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley\" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.\u00a0 He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real. But he did have fun playing in the clouds. He made Sir Basil suffer when he shot his tail off, as he pretended to be dead. Poor Sir Basil didn't know what to do, so as usual shouted for Lady Rosemary, who saw Parsley was faking it. His best friend is Dill the dog and both of them seem to get themselves into trouble. But once in a while Parsley does come up with a good idea, such as the time he persuaded Pashana Bedhi to use his snake charming skills to float Sage and his nest back in the tree. \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley with a tail for doing jobs of every kind but I mustn't treat it roughly or too harshly for it's such a useful thing to have behind\" His songs are: \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I am always very glad to see you wave but please don't shout or speak to me too harshly because I'm not particularly brave\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I really don't like climbing things at all so please don't shout or speak to me too harshly I am sure you wouldn't want to see me fall\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I'm supposed to pull this rope and ring the bell though I try to pull it gently never harshly I'm afraid that I'm not doing very well\" \"For today I",

As with their parents, Devil\u2019s Coach Horse larvae are carnivorous feeding on a variety of other invertebrates; possess powerful jaws to catch and consume their prey; and can even adopt the threatened display of a raised tail and open jaws. The larva goes through three successive growth stages (instars). The third and final larval stage is reached after approximately 150 days when it is between 20 \u2013 26mm in length. It is at this stage that pupation begins and an adult beetle emerges about 35 days later. It emerges fully formed but needs to stay inactive for a few hours to allow its wings to dry out before they can be folded beneath the wing case (elytra). [PAR] If the weather",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] EastEndersEastEnders is a British soap opera; the first episode was broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 19 February 1985. EastEnders storylines examine the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in the fictional London Borough of Walford in the East End of London. The series primarily centres on the residents of Albert Square, a Victorian square of terraced houses, and its neighbouring streets, namely Bridge Street, Turpin Road and George Street. The area encompasses a pub, street market, night club, community centre, funeral parlour, caf\u00e9, wine bar, various other small businesses, a park and allotments. [PAR] The series was initially screened as two half-hour instalments per week. Since 2001, episodes are broadcast each weekday, apart from Wednesday, on BBC One. A same-day repeat was shown on BBC Three, from 2004 until 15 February 2016, after which W took over the showing. An omnibus edition was broadcast on a Sunday, from 1985 until its discontinuation, in 2015, but, as with the repeat screening, this was picked up by W in 2016. [PAR] It is one of the UK's highest-rated programmes, often appearing near or at the top of the week's BARB ratings. Within eight months of its launch, it reached the number-one spot in the ratings, and has consistently remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent.  Created by producer Julia Smith and script editor Tony Holland, EastEnders has remained a significant programme in terms of the BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many controversial and taboo issues in British culture and social life previously unseen on United Kingdom mainstream television.  [PAR] , EastEnders has won nine BAFTA Awards and the Inside Soap Award for Best Soap for 14 years running (from 1997 to 2012),  as well as twelve National Television Awards for Most Popular Serial Drama  and 11 awards for Best Soap at the British Soap Awards. It has also won 13 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards for Best Soap, six TRIC Awards for Soap of The Year, four Royal Television Society Awards for Best Continuing Drama and has been inducted into the Rose d'Or Hall of Fame.  [PAR] Setting  [PAR] The central focus of EastEnders is the fictional Victorian square Albert Square in the fictional London Borough of Walford. In the show's narrative, Albert Square is a 19th-century street, named after Prince Albert (1819\u201361), the husband of Queen Victoria (1819\u20131901, reigned 1837\u20131901). Thus, central to Albert Square is The Queen Victoria Public House.  [PAR] Fans have tried to establish the location Walford would have within London if it were real. Walford East is a fictional tube station for Walford, and a tube map that was first seen on air in 1996 showed Walford East between Bow Road and West Ham, in the actual location of Bromley-by-Bow on the District and Hammersmith & City lines.  [PAR] Walford has the postal district of E20. The postcode district was selected as if it were part of the actual E postcode area which covers much of east London although the next unused postcode district in the area was, and still is (), E19.  The E stands for Eastern.HMSO, The Inner London Letter Post, (1980) In 1917 the current postal districts in London were assigned alphabetically according to the name of the main sorting office for each district. If Walford had been assigned in this scheme it would have been given E17, which is the current postcode district for Walthamstow. In March 2011, Royal Mail allocated the E20 postal district to the 2012 Olympic Park. The postal district in EastEnders was entirely fictional up to that point, as London East postal districts stopped at E18 at that time. The show's creators opted for E20 instead of E19 as it was thought to sound better.  In September 2011 the postal code for Albert Square was revealed in an episode as E20 6PQ.

Though the origins of curling are unclear, most people regard Scotland as curling\u2019s birthplace. Today, curling is played around the world, largely thanks to its introduction into the Olympics in 1988. Because curling can seem complicated if you don\u2019t know a lot about it, these articles help to explain the basics, from curling terminology and the roles of each position on a team, to how scoring and other elements of the game work, and why curling is such a great sport to play. [PAR] Curling Match Terminology [PAR] Curling, probably more than any other sport, has its own unique terminology (like hurry hard and burning a rock, among others). Here are the key curling words and phrases you need to know to blend in at your next bonspiel: [PAR] Blank end: An end where no points are scored. [PAR] Bonspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete. [PAR] Burning a rock: A rules infraction that happens when a player touches a stone as it\u2019s traveling down the sheet. [PAR] Button: The very center of the target rings or house. [PAR] Cashspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete for money. [PAR] Delivery: The action of throwing a stone to the other end of the playing surface. [PAR] Eight-ender: A perfect end where every one of the team\u2019s stones scores a point. [PAR] End: The way a curling game is divided. An end is like an inning in a baseball game. A curling game has either eight or ten ends. [PAR] Gripper: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you keep your footing on the ice. See slider. [PAR] Hammer: The last rock of the end. [PAR] Hack: The foothold in the ice you use to push off from when you deliver the stone. [PAR] House: Also known as the rings, this is the name of the giant bull\u2019s eye at either end of the sheet of ice. It consists of a set of concentric circles, called the 12-foot, 8-foot, 4-foot, and the Button. [PAR] Hurry hard: A directive given to sweepers by the skip or third, to begin sweeping. [PAR] Rink: A curling team; also the name of a curling facility [PAR] Rock: Also known as a stone, the granite playing utensil that a curler delivers. Regular-sized rocks weigh approximately 44 pounds. [PAR] Sheet: The frozen playing surface on which the game is played. [PAR] Slider: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you move or slide along the ice. [PAR] Tee line: The line on the playing surface that runs through the middle of the house. [PAR] Weight: The amount of force used to deliver a stone. [PAR] The Members of a Curling Team [PAR] In curling, the team you play on is called a rink. The rink is made up of four players: the lead, the second, the third (also called the vice, vice-skip, or mate), and the skip. Each player has specific duties: [PAR] Lead: The lead throws the first two rocks of the end and then sweeps the next six. The lead must be very good at throwing guards and a strong sweeper. [PAR] Second: The second throws the third and fourth stones of the end and should be strong at playing takeouts. The second sweeps the first two stones and then the final four of the end. The second and the lead need to be in sync when sweeping together. [PAR] Third: The third (or mate or vice), who throws the fifth and sixth rocks of the end, must be good at all shots, but especially draws. It is the third\u2019s job to set up the shots that will be thrown by the skip, and to help the skip discuss the strategy of the final two stones of the end. The third also posts the score at the conclusion of the end",

[PAR] In 1936, Prokofiev returned to settle permanently in the Soviet Union.\u00a0 One of his first compositions after his return was Peter and the Wolf, written in just two weeks in April of 1936 for a children's theater in Moscow.\u00a0 Prokofiev invented the story and wrote the narration himself, drawing on memories of his own childhood.\u00a0 He constructed the music as a child's introduction to the orchestra, with each character in the story represented by a different instrument or group of instruments: Peter by the strings, the bird by the flute, the duck by the oboe, the cat by the clarinet, the wolf by the horn section, and so on. [PAR] Peter and the Wolf was an immediate success and has been loved by children all over the world.\u00a0 The music is sophisticated enough to be enjoyed by adults, even through repeated hearings.\u00a0 And its moral \u0097 you can't be a hero if you don't take risks \u0097 delights children as it must have cheered the composer.

To this the duck replied \"What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?\" and dived into the pond.

[PAR] History [PAR] Homer was relying on a Christmas bonus to buy presents, but didn't get it. He was relying on this bonus because the jar of Christmas money that Marge accumulates for the family's Christmas treats was disposed of to pay for the removal of a tattoo that Bart got on his arm. Homer took the small amount of Christmas money he made working as Santa Claus at the Springfield Mall and bet it at the dog track. He had inside information on what dog was going to win, but instead bet on the \"long shot,\" Santa's Little Helper, believing his name to be a sign. Santa's Little Helper finished last (apparently, it was the latest in a long string of last-place finishes), and his frustrated owner abandoned him. Homer and Bart brought him home, and everyone was so happy with him that it was a merry Christmas after all. [1] [PAR] Snowball II , Maggie and Santa's Little Helper together for a picture [PAR] Sometimes, Santa's Little Helper can be seen chewing on the newspaper and other objects in the Simpson's household (sometimes ignored or tolerated by the family), tearing up the furniture, digging holes in the backyard and eating food from the living room table. It is stated that Homer and Santa's Little Helper's birthdays are on the same day. [2] [PAR] With a few exceptions, Santa's Little Helper doesn't make any sound that resembles a bark. However, he does have an ability to think just like a person. Once, he made a sound similar to \"chewy\", and Homer writes it down in his review, amazed that the dog spoke English. [3] He is also shown to have ridden a circus ball on his hind legs and speak the phrase 'We love... you!' in an attempt to be given some attention from the Simpson family. [4] In addition, he was mascot of Duff Beer , and was known as Suds McDuff (a reference to a similar, real life mascot Spuds MacKenzie). [5] [PAR] Santa's Little Helper licking Bart [PAR] Santa's Little Helper's life with the Simpsons is not always easy. Due to his disobedience and destructive behavior nearly caused the Simpson family to give him away, but he passed an obedience class, thus he could stay. [6] Santa's Little Helper almost passed away from gastric torsion (referred to in the show as a \"twisting of the stomach\") because Homer initially couldn't afford $750 for the required operation. [7] He also broke two legs when Bart's treehouse was demolished by Mr. Burns ' slanted oil well drill (The latter of which caused Bart Simpson to hate Mr. Burns immensely). [8] Santa's Little Helper is sometimes a bad dog. [PAR] At one time, Santa's Little Helper was shortly abandoned by Bart for Laddie , a purebred and very well-trained dog he bought from a mail-order catalog together with various other expensive gifts and gadgets. To do that, Bart used a credit card he applied for under the name of his dog, yet the credit card company misread the form and issued a card to Mr. \"Santos L. Halper\". Laddie learned many tricks that Santa's Little Helper was completely unable to perform (most notably a back flip, CPR and using a toilet). The Simpson family nearly forgot about their old pet, and Bart eventually gave him away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tried to get Santa's Little Helper back. When he finally found him, Santa's Little Helper was serving as a guide dog for a blind man named Mr. Mitchell, but eventually chose to return to his former owner, Bart.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] NATO phonetic alphabetThe International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet and also known as the ICAO radiotelephonic, phonetic or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet. Although often called \"phonetic alphabets\", spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel. [PAR] The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot,  Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu. [PAR] International adoption [PAR] After the phonetic alphabet was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  (see history below) it was adopted by many other international and national organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). [PAR] It is a subset of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which originally included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound signals by whistle, siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases.  The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...).  In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages. [PAR] NATO [PAR] A common name for this spelling alphabet, \"NATO phonetic alphabet,\" exists because it appears in Allied Tactical Publication ATP-1, Volume II: Allied Maritime Signal and Maneuvering Book used by all allied navies of NATO, which adopted a modified form of the International Code of Signals. Because the latter allows messages to be spelled via flags or Morse code, it naturally named the code words used to spell out messages by voice its \"phonetic alphabet\". The name NATO phonetic alphabet became widespread because the signals used to facilitate the naval communications and tactics of NATO have become global.  [PAR] However, ATP-1 is marked NATO Confidential (or the lower NATO Restricted) so it is not available publicly. Nevertheless, a NATO unclassified version of the document is provided to foreign, even hostile, militaries, even though they are not allowed to make it available publicly. The spelling alphabet is now also defined in other unclassified international military documents.  [PAR] The NATO alphabet appeared in some United States Air Force Europe publications during the Cold War. A particular example was the Ramstein Air Base, Telephone Directory published between 1969 and 1973 (currently out of print). The American and NATO versions had differences and the translation was provided as a convenience. Differences included Alfa, Bravo and Able, Baker for the first two letters. [PAR] History [PAR] The ICAO developed this system in the 1950s in order to account for discrepancies that might arise in communications as a result of multiple alphabet naming systems coexisting in different places and organizations.  [PAR] In the official   version of the alphabet, the non-English spellings Alfa and Juliett are used. Alfa is spelled with an f as it is in most European languages because the English and French spelling alpha would not be pronounced properly by native speakers of some other languages \u2013 who may not know that ph should be pronounced as f.\u00a0 Juliett is spelled with a tt",
    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo address this task, I first analyze the given context and the question-answer pair provided.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context discusses the NATO phonetic alphabet, its usage, and history. It explains that the NATO phonetic alphabet is used for clear communication over radio and telephone, assigning specific code words to the letters of the English alphabet. The question asks for a term that can be a NATO phonetic alphabet letter, a landform at the mouth of a river, or a plumbing fixture company. The answer given is \"delta.\"\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The NATO phonetic alphabet assigns the word \"Delta\" to the letter \"D\". In geography, a delta is a landform that forms at the mouth of a river. Additionally, \"Delta\" is a well-known brand associated with plumbing fixtures. Thus, \"Delta\" fits all three descriptions provided in the question.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The difficulty level of this question is moderate to high because it requires the test-taker to understand the multiple uses of the term \"Delta\" and connect them to the NATO phonetic alphabet, a geographical term, and a brand name. I would rate this question an 8 out of 10 in terms of complexity.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: The question invites deeper understanding by requiring the test-taker to think about the multiple meanings of \"Delta\" and how they relate to different contexts. It encourages reflection on the versatility of terms and their applications across different domains.\n\nThe rationale behind including this question is to test the domain expert's ability to recognize and apply the knowledge of the NATO phonetic alphabet in a broader context, connecting it with other uses of the same term.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What term is used as a code word for the letter \"D\" in the NATO phonetic alphabet, also refers to a specific type of landform that occurs at the mouth of a river, and is the name of a well-known company that manufactures plumbing fixtures?\nExplanation: The term \"Delta\" is the code word for \"D\" in the NATO phonetic alphabet. In geography, a delta is a landform that forms at the mouth of a river.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] David CameronDavid William Donald Cameron (; born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016. He was the Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016, and has been Member of Parliament for Witney since 2001. Cameron identifies as a One-Nation Conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. [PAR] Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.  It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage. [PAR] Internationally, his government militarily intervened in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured a majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as Prime Minister leading a Conservative government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he chose to resign to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.  [PAR] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for reining in the United Kingdom's national debt. Conversely, he has been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of political opportunism and social elitism. Cameron appeared on the Forbes List of The World's Most Powerful People from 2010.  [PAR] Family [PAR] Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010), a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur,  Mount (born 1934), a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.  Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962. The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".  [PAR] Cameron was born in Marylebone, London,  and raised in Peasemore, Berkshire.  He has a brother, Alexander Cameron, QC (born 1963), a barrister,  and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).  [PAR] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;  Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,  who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.  [PAR] Cameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh, and English.\"  He has also referenced the German Jewish ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the Yiddish author Elia Levita.   [PAR] Education [PAR] From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its old boys. Owing to good grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early.",

The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and many aspects of the human condition. It's the 20th Century Fox debut in animation. [PAR] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390). [PAR] Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the series has broadcast  episodes. It will begin airing its 28th season in September 2016. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American scripted primetime television series. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. On May 4, 2015, the series was officially renewed for seasons twenty-seven (2015\u201316) and twenty-eight (2016\u201317), consisting of 22 episodes each.   [PAR] The Simpsons has received widespread critical acclaim, especially for the \"Golden Age\" of approximately its first ten seasons. Time magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,  and The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\".   On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms. Despite this, the show has also been criticized for what many perceive as a decline in quality over the years. [PAR] Premise [PAR] Characters [PAR] The Simpsons are a family who live in a fictional \"Middle American\" town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.  The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\".  Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. [PAR] The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV.  [PAR] Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a floating timeline in which episodes generally take place in the year",

He decided the only thing to do was destroy them all  and start over! But there was one man, Noah, who was obedient to God and found God's  favor. [PAR] Noah Builds an Ark [PAR] God told Noah to bring a pair of every    living animal into the ark to keep them alive during the flood. [PAR] God told Noah to build a big boat, called an ark, and He told Noah exactly how to do it. The ark was to be 450 ft. (137 m) long, 75 ft. (23 m) wide and 45  ft. (14 m) high. It was to have three decks, be divided into rooms and have a door  in the side. [PAR] Noah was to find one male and one female of every kind of animal  and bird and take them into the ark. He also had to take food for all those animals.  It took Noah 120 years to build the ark and find all the animals to put in it, but  Noah obeyed God and did just as he was told. [PAR] The Great Flood [PAR] Noah was 600 years old by the time everything was ready. God told Noah to go into  the ark with his wife, his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives.  Then it started to rain. It rained without stop for forty days and nights! The water  got so deep that even the mountains were covered. Every living creature on earth  died in the flood. But the ark floated on top of the flood waters and the people  and animals in the ark were safe. [PAR] Noah knew the dove had found dry land    when it returned to him carrying an olive branch. [PAR] Eventually, the water started to go down again, and the ark came to rest in the  mountains of Ararat. After being on the ark about 11 months, Noah sent out a dove  to see if it would find land, but it found no place to rest and returned to the  ark. Seven days later, Noah sent the dove out again. This time it flew back carrying  an olive leaf, and Noah knew it had found land. After a full year on the ark, God  said to Noah, [PAR] Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives. Bring   out every kind of living creature that is with you \u2013 the birds, the animals,   and all the creatures that move along the ground \u2013 so they can multiply   on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it. (NIV, Genesis 8:16-17) [PAR] God Makes a Promise to Noah [PAR] After leaving the ark, Noah built an altar and worshipped God. God was pleased with  Noah, and He promised never again to destroy the earth with a flood. Then God placed  a rainbow in the sky as a sign of that promise. The descendants of Noah and his  sons filled the whole earth with people again. [PAR] Lessons [PAR] Except for Noah and his family, all the people of the world were going about their  evil and wicked ways. The earth was filled with violence. Mankind had lost sight  of God and the way He wanted them to live together in harmony. God rewarded Noah  for his righteousness, but He decided there was no choice but to destroy the wicked  people of the earth. [PAR] Similarly, those of us who love God and obey His commandments  will be rewarded with eternal life, but God will not let that life be corrupted  by evil people.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] MinnesotaMinnesota (; locally ) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The name comes from the Dakota word for \"clear blue water\".  Owing to its large number of lakes, the state is informally known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    [PAR] Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. [PAR] Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non-native inhabitants. A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland. Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many first working in iron mines. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, Somalia, and Latin America has broadened the state's historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota has America's largest Somali population.  Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: Mnisota. The root mni (also spelled mini or minne) means \"water\" and \"t\u014d\" (\"ta\") means \"blue\".  Mnisota can be translated as clear blue water or clouded blue water depending on pronunciation.   Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it mnisota. Many places in the state have similar names, such as Minnehaha Falls (\"laughing water\" (waterfall)), Minneiska (\"white water\"), Minneota (\"much water\"), Minnetonka (\"big water\"), Minnetrista (\"crooked water\"), and Minneapolis, a combination of mni and polis, the Greek word for \"city\".  [PAR] Geography [PAR] Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state is part of the U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north.

About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the primordial ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota.  The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ColorColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, blue, yellow, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates. [PAR] Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance. [PAR] The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light). [PAR] Physics of color  [PAR] Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\". [PAR] Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called metamers of the color in question. [PAR] Spectral colors  [PAR] The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum \u2013 named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671 \u2013 include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see refractive index). [PAR] The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list \u2013 the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to perceive colors in the same way ). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today we call cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported at the time.  [PAR] The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive-green. [PAR] Color of objects  [PAR] The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contribute to the color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the",

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] MinnesotaMinnesota (; locally ) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The name comes from the Dakota word for \"clear blue water\".  Owing to its large number of lakes, the state is informally known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    [PAR] Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. [PAR] Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non-native inhabitants. A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland. Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many first working in iron mines. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, Somalia, and Latin America has broadened the state's historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota has America's largest Somali population.  Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: Mnisota. The root mni (also spelled mini or minne) means \"water\" and \"t\u014d\" (\"ta\") means \"blue\".  Mnisota can be translated as clear blue water or clouded blue water depending on pronunciation.   Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it mnisota. Many places in the state have similar names, such as Minnehaha Falls (\"laughing water\" (waterfall)), Minneiska (\"white water\"), Minneota (\"much water\"), Minnetonka (\"big water\"), Minnetrista (\"crooked water\"), and Minneapolis, a combination of mni and polis, the Greek word for \"city\".  [PAR] Geography [PAR] Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state is part of the U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north. With ,  or approximately 2.25 percent of the United States,  Minnesota is the 12th-largest state.  [PAR] Geology [PAR] Minnesota contains some of the oldest rocks found on earth, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the primordial ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota.  The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.

    "orig_answer": "sixpence",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit). However, in Italy Mario Monti declared Italian Lira banknotes unredeemable for euros some months before the regular expiration of the 10-year term, and this is also true when the banknotes were lost before and then are found after",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The SimpsonsThe Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.    The series is a satirical depiction of a working class lifestyle epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and many aspects of the human condition. It's the 20th Century Fox debut in animation. [PAR] The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390). [PAR] Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the series has broadcast  episodes. It will begin airing its 28th season in September 2016. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American scripted primetime television series. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. On May 4, 2015, the series was officially renewed for seasons twenty-seven (2015\u201316) and twenty-eight (2016\u201317), consisting of 22 episodes each.   [PAR] The Simpsons has received widespread critical acclaim, especially for the \"Golden Age\" of approximately its first ten seasons. Time magazine named it the 20th century's best television series,  and The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\".   On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms. Despite this, the show has also been criticized for what many perceive as a decline in quality over the years. [PAR] Premise [PAR] Characters [PAR] The Simpsons are a family who live in a fictional \"Middle American\" town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.  The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\".  Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. [PAR] The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV.  [PAR] Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a floating timeline in which episodes generally take place in the year",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Henry III of EnglandHenry III (1 October 1207\u00a0\u2013 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death.  The son of King John and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church. [PAR] Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles. He married Eleanor of Provence, with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his piety, holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor, whom he adopted as his patron saint. He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England, ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the Statute of Jewry, attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he invaded Poitou in 1242, leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256, but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily, despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on crusade to the Levant, but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony. [PAR] By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX of France recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued. [PAR] In 1263 one of the more radical barons, Simon de Montfort, seized power, resulting in the Second Barons' War. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, Edward, escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised. [PAR] Background and childhood [PAR] Henry was born in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207.  He was the",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is an English Christmas carol that enumerates in the manner of a cumulative song a series of increasingly grand gifts given on each of the twelve days of Christmas (the twelve days after Christmas). The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin. \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 68. The tunes of collected versions vary. The standard tune now associated with it is derived from a 1909 arrangement of a traditional folk melody by English composer Frederic Austin, who first introduced the now familiar prolongation of the verse \"five gold rings\". [PAR] Lyrics  [PAR] \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses. There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by \"my true love\" on one of the twelve days of Christmas. [PAR] There are many variations in the lyrics. The lyrics given here are from Austin's 1909 publication that first established the current form of the carol.   The first three verses run, in full, as follows: [PAR] Subsequent verses follow the same pattern, each adding one new gift and repeating all the earlier gifts, so that each verse is one line longer than its predecessor: [PAR] 4 Calling Birds  [PAR] 5 Gold Rings  [PAR] 6 Geese a-Laying [PAR] 7 Swans a-Swimming [PAR] 8 Maids a-Milking [PAR] 9 Ladies Dancing [PAR] 10 Lords a-Leaping [PAR] 11 Pipers Piping [PAR] 12 Drummers Drumming [PAR] Variations of the lyrics  [PAR] The earliest known version of the lyrics was published under the title \"The Twelve Days of Christmas sung at King Pepin's Ball\", as part of a 1780 children's book, Mirth without Mischief.  Subsequent versions have shown considerable variation: [PAR] * In the earliest versions, the word \"On\" is not present at the beginning of each verse\u2014for example, the first verse begins simply \"The first day of Christmas\".  \"On\" was added in Austin's 1909 version, and became very popular thereafter. [PAR] * In the early versions \"my true love sent\" me the gifts. However, a 20th-century variant has \"my true love gave to me\"; this wording has become particularly common in North America.  [PAR] * The 1780 version has \"four colly birds\"\u2014\"colly\" being a regional English expression for \"black\".   This wording must have been opaque to many even in the 19th century: \"canary birds\", \"colour'd birds\", \"curley birds\", and \"corley birds\" are found in its place.  Frederic Austin's 1909 version, which introduced the now-standard melody, also altered the fourth day's gift to four \"calling\" birds, and this variant has become the most popular, although \"colly\" is still found. [PAR] * The \"five gold rings\" may become \"five golden rings\", especially in North America. In the standard melody, this change enables singers to fit one syllable per musical note.  [PAR] * The gifts associated with the final four days are often reordered.  For example, the pipers may be on the ninth day rather than the eleventh.

Whether these two petitions will come to fruition remains to be seen\u2014the final names are not likely to be announced until later in the spring\u2014but as IUPAC rules demand all new elements be named after either a mythological concept or character, a mineral, a place, a property of the element itself, or a scientist [ PDF ], it seems unlikely we\u2019ll be seeing lemmium on the walls of chemistry classes any time soon. The stories behind 20 other chemical element names are explained here.\u00a0 [PAR] 1. LITHIUM (3) [PAR] Despite being the least dense metal, lithium takes its name from the Greek word for \u201cstone,\u201d lithos, because it was discovered in a rock (as opposed to the other alkali metals potassium and sodium, which were discovered in plants and animals).\u00a0 [PAR] 2. CARBON (6) [PAR] The name carbon comes from the Latin word carbo, meaning \u201ccoal\u201d or \u201ccharcoal.\u201d A small carbo, incidentally, was a carbunculus, which is the origin of carbuncle.\u00a0 [PAR] 3. NEON (10) [PAR] Neon takes its name from neos, the Greek word for \u201cnew\u201d (it was \u201cnewly\u201d discovered in 1898). [PAR] 4. PHOSPHORUS (15) [PAR] Phosphorus literally means \u201clight-bearer\u201d or \u201clight-bringing,\u201d as the first compound of the element glowed in the dark. A century before it became the name of element 15 in the late 1600s, Phosphorus was an alternative name for the planet Venus, whose appearance in the sky was once believed to strengthen the light and heat of the Sun. [PAR] 5. VANADIUM (23) [PAR] One of the transition metals, pure vanadium is a harsh steel-grey color, but four of its oxidation states produce a rainbow of solutions, colored purple, green, blue, and yellow . Because he was so impressed with how beautiful and varied these solutions were, the Swedish chemist Nils Sefstr\u00f6m chose to name vanadium after Vanad\u00eds, an alternate name for the Norse goddess of beauty, Freya. Vanadium\u2019s next door neighbor, chromium (24), also produces a variety of colored compounds and so takes its name from the Greek word for \u201ccolor,\u201d chroma.\u00a0 [PAR] 6. COBALT (27) [PAR] Cobalt is often naturally found alongside or in minerals combined with arsenic, and when smelted, cobalt ore can emit noxious arsenic-laden fumes. Long before the poisonous qualities of minerals like these could be explained by science, copper\u00a0miners in central Europe had no better explanation than to presume these toxic effects were supernatural, and were caused by devious underground goblins called kobolds who lived inside the rock\u2014and it's from the German word kobold that cobalt gets its name.\u00a0 [PAR] 7. COPPER (29) [PAR] The chemical symbol for copper is Cu, which derives from the metal\u2019s Latin name, cuprum.

Lincoln is situated in a gap in the Lincoln Cliff 141 mi north of London, at an elevation of  above sea level by the River Witham, stretching up to 75 m above sea level in the uphill area around the cathedral. [PAR] History [PAR] Earliest history: Lincoln [PAR] The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in 1972) that have been dated to the 1st century BC. This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the River Witham at the foot of a large hill (on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle). [PAR] The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brythonic language of Iron Age Britain's Celtic inhabitants as Lindon \"The Pool\",  presumably referring to the Brayford Pool (compare the etymology of the name Dublin, from the Gaelic dubh linn \"black pool\"). The extent of this original settlement is unknown as its remains are now buried deep beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins, and modern Lincoln. [PAR] Roman history: Lindum Colonia [PAR] The Romans conquered this part of Britain in AD 48 and shortly afterwards built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake formed by the widening of the River Witham (the modern day Brayford Pool) and at the northern end of the Fosse Way Roman road (A46). The Celtic name Lindon was subsequently Latinised to Lindum and given the title Colonia when it was converted into a settlement for army veterans.  [PAR] The conversion to a colonia was made when the legion moved on to York (Eboracum) in AD 71. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after its founder Domitian, was established within the walls of the hilltop fortress with the addition of an extension of about equal area, down the hillside to the waterside below. [PAR] It became a major flourishing settlement, accessible from the sea both through the River Trent and through the River Witham. On the basis of the patently corrupt list of British bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles, the city is now often considered to have been the capital of the province of Flavia Caesariensis which was formed during the late-3rd century Diocletian Reforms. Subsequently, however, the town and its waterways fell into decline. By the close of the 5th century the city was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a Praefectus Civitatis, for Saint Paulinus visited a man of this office in Lincoln in AD 629. [PAR] AD 410\u20131066 [PAR] During this period the Latin name Lindum Colonia was shortened in Old English to become first Lindocolina, then Lincylene.  [PAR] After the first destructive Viking raids, the city once again rose to some importance, with overseas trading connections. In Viking times Lincoln was a trading centre that issued coins from its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to the mint at York.  After the establishment of Dane Law in 886, Lincoln became one of The Five Boroughs in the East Midlands. Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that this area, deserted since Roman times, received new timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system in about 900.  Lincoln experienced an unprecedented explosion in its economy with the settlement of the Danes. Like York, the Upper City seems to have been given over to purely administrative functions up to 850 or so, while the Lower",

Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area and the largest North American country. Canada extends from the Pacific to the Atlantic and north to the Arctic Ocean. The United States-Canadian border is the longest land border in the world. [PAR] Canada's most recent census was conducted in 2016, but the official results will not be released until early 2017. Prior to 2016, the last census was completed in Canada on May 10 2011. Preliminary figures released on 8 February 2012 showed that the officially recorded population of Canada was 33,476,688. Canada is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, with much of its land inhospitable. The country's population density is under 4 people per square kilometer, which ranks 228th in the world. [PAR] Rapid Population Growth [PAR] As you can see from the chart below, Canada's population has tripled since the 1940s, growing from 11 million at the time of the second world war to over 36 million today. [PAR] Population growth has been fairly consistent over the past fifty years and shows no sign of slowing. Between the last census in 2006 and 2011, the number of people in Canada increased by an impressive 5.9%. Current estimates show that the population has increased an addition 7.5% since 2011. [PAR] Canada's growth is fueled largely by immigration. In fact, relative to its size, Canada is the largest importer of human capital in the Group of Eight, attracting even more immigrants per capita than the USA. Natural population growth, by contrast, accounts for only around one-tenth of Canada's overall population increase each year. Worldwide, Canada is 9th in crude net migration rate. [PAR] Given the large geographical area of Canada and its relative affluence, it is likely that its population will continue to grow rapidly for decades to come, leading some to speculate as to what a Canada of 100 million people might look like, and whether increased population combined with unrivaled access to natural resources would make Canada a global superpower. [PAR] Canada's Population by Province and Territory [PAR] The census results also show the population of each Canadian province and territory. More than half of Canadians live in just two provinces; Ontario, where one in three Canadians live, and Quebec where almost a quarter of Canadians live. The combined population of Canada's three territories (Northwest, Yukon and Nunavut) is less than the population of Canada's smallest province (Prince Edward Island). [PAR] Province/Territory [PAR] 0.1% [PAR] Largest Cities in Canada [PAR] The largest city in Canada by population is Toronto, home to 2,615,060 people at the time of the 2011 census, and an estimated 2.8 million in 2016. The wider Toronto metropolitan area is over twice as populous, containing around 6 million people in total. [PAR] Canada's second largest city is Montreal in Quebec, where 1,649,519 people live, followed in third place by Calgary in Alberta with 1,096,833. Calgary is growing at almost twice the Canadian average, so if current trends continue it will no doubt overtake Montreal in the future. Ottawa is Canada's fourth largest city \u2013 883,391 people live in the capital city. [PAR] The fastest growing large city between 2006 and 2011 was Brampton, Ontario. In the 5 year period, the city grew by nearly 21% en route to surpassing 500,000 residents. Montreal is the slowest growing major city in Canada, with growth of just 1.8% from 2006 to 2011. By comparison, Canada itself grew by 5.9% during the 5 year period.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo address the given task, let's first analyze the provided context, question, and answer.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context provides information about Canada's population in 2016, its growth, and distribution across provinces and territories. It mentions that Canada has three territories: Northwest, Yukon, and Nunavut.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The question asks for Canada's largest, newest, and least populated territory. The context does not directly provide a comparison of the territories based on these criteria, but it does mention the three territories.\n\n3. **Identifying Relevant Information**: Upon closer inspection, we find that while the context lists the three territories (Northwest, Yukon, and Nunavut), it does not explicitly state their relative sizes, ages, or populations. However, it is known from general knowledge that Nunavut is the largest and newest territory, created in 1999 from part of the Northwest Territories.\n\n4. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The original question requires the test-taker to have some knowledge about the Canadian territories. The difficulty level is moderate because it assumes some familiarity with Canadian geography and history.\n\n5. **Intentional Question Planning**: The question invites a deeper understanding of Canadian geography and administrative divisions.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Tower BridgeTower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built in 1886\u20131894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets. [PAR] The bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. [PAR] The bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway. The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge. [PAR] History [PAR] Inception [PAR] In the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the East End of London led to a requirement for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London. [PAR] A Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect (who was also one of the judges),  was approved. [PAR] Jones' engineer, Sir John Wolfe Barry, devised the idea of a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. [PAR] Construction [PAR] Construction started in 1887 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.  \u2013 and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction. [PAR] Two massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete, were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance. [PAR] Jones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project. Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa\u00e7ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London. The total cost of construction was \u00a31,184,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ).

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ColorColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, blue, yellow, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates. [PAR] Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance. [PAR] The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light). [PAR] Physics of color  [PAR] Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\". [PAR] Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called metamers of the color in question. [PAR] Spectral colors  [PAR] The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum \u2013 named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671 \u2013 include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors.

A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet.

In the film, she is re-imagined as a sultry but moral cartoon actress and singer at a Los Angeles supper club called the Ink and Paint Club . [PAR] Contents [PAR] Background [PAR] Physical Description [PAR] Jessica is a tall, voluptuous woman with a curvy and slender hourglass figure with a narrow waist, huge and broad hips. She has fair skin and long, luxurious red hair with sidebangs that usually cover her right eye. Her green eyes are heavy-lidded and seductive with long dark lashes and accented by shimmering lavender eyeshadow. Her nose is fairly small, especially in relation to her full, red pouting lips.

[PAR] Elizabeth was born in London to the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and was the elder of their two daughters. She was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with whom she has four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward. [PAR] Elizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and reciprocal visits to and from the Pope. She has seen major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. She has also reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of her realms. She is the world's oldest reigning monarch as well as Britain's longest-lived. In 2015, she surpassed the reign of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in world history.

[PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.

Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality:  of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for machine-made paper, while quires of 24 sheets are often used for handmade or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets. ) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, depending on the type of paper.  [PAR] Nomenclature [PAR] The current word \"quire\" derives from OE \"quair\" or \"guaer\", from OF \"quayer\", \"cayer\", (cf. modern Fr. cahier), from L. quaternum, \"by fours\", \"fourfold\". Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the association of \"quaire\" with \"four\" was quickly lost. [PAR] History [PAR] In the Middle Ages, a quire (also called a \"gathering\") was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term \"quaternion\" (or sometimes quaternum) designates such a quire. A quire made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a \"bifolium\" (plural \"bifolia\"); a \"binion\" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a \"quinion\" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian term for quire, quinterno di carta. [PAR] Formerly, when paper was packed at the paper mill, the top and bottom quires were made up of slightly damaged sheets (\"outsides\") to protect the good quires (\"insides\"). These outside quires were known as \"cassie quires\" (from Fr. cass\u00e9e, \"broken\"), or \"cording quires\" and had only 20 sheets to the quire.  The printer William Caslon in a book published in 1770 mentions both 24- and 25-sheet quires; he also details printer's wastage, and the sorting and recycling of damaged cassie quires.  An 1826 French manual on typography complained that cording quires (usually containing some salvageable paper) from the Netherlands barely contained a single good sheet.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo address the task, let's first analyze the given context, question, and answer.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context discusses various measures of paper quantity, including the term \"quire.\" It explains that a quire is a measure of paper quantity, typically consisting of 25 sheets of the same size and quality, which is 1/20 of a ream of 500 sheets. The context also delves into the history and nomenclature of the term \"quire,\" its usage in different contexts such as writing paper, 'short' paper, and printing measurements.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The concept of a quire is explored in depth, including its historical usage, variations in the number of sheets it contains (e.g., 24 sheets for 'short' quire), and its etymology. The context highlights that the term \"quire\" has evolved over time and has been used differently in various contexts, including bookmaking and paper production.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The original question \"What is measured in quires?\" is straightforward and can be considered easy (difficulty level: 2). To increase the complexity, we need to rephrase the question to encourage deeper understanding or reflection.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: To create a more challenging and thought-provoking question, we could rephrase it to focus on a specific aspect of the context that requires deeper understanding or analysis. For example, exploring the historical context or the variations in the definition of a quire.\n\nGiven the context and the original question and answer, let's rephrase them to meet the guidelines.\n\nThe original question is: \"What is measured in quires?\"\nThe original answer is: \"paper\"\n\nTo rephrase the question and maintain semantic equivalence while increasing complexity, we could ask:\n\n\"Historically, what type of material was initially quantified in quires before the widespread use of paper, and how does this relate to the modern understanding of a quire in the context of paper measurement?\"\n\nHowever, to adhere strictly to the guidelines and ensure the question is answerable by a domain expert without the context paragraph, a more suitable rephrased question could be:\n\n\"What material, aside from paper, has been historically quantified using the unit 'quire', reflecting the term's origins and evolution in bookmaking and document preparation?\"\n\nThis rephrased question still doesn't fit perfectly as it slightly deviates from the original answer.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)The Speaker of the House of Commons is the presiding officer of the House of Commons, the United Kingdom's lower chamber of Parliament. The office is currently held by John Bercow, who was initially elected on 22 June 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin. He was returned as an MP in the 2010 general election and was re-elected as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2010. He was again returned as an MP in the 2015 general election and was re-elected, unopposed, as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2015.  [PAR] The Speaker presides over the House's debates, determining which members may speak. The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries, the Speaker remains strictly non-partisan, and renounces all affiliation with his or her former political party when taking office as well as when leaving the office. The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to Speaker Denison's rule). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions, and remains a constituency Member of Parliament (MP). The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker's House at the Palace of Westminster.  [PAR] History [PAR] The office of Speaker is almost as old as Parliament itself. The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258, when Peter de Montfort presided over the Parliament held in Oxford. Early presiding officers were known by the title parlour or prolocutor. The continuous history of the office of Speaker is held to date from 1376  when Sir Peter de la Mare spoke for the commons in the \"Good Parliament\" as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of the Crown and the most unpopular members of the king's household. Edward III was frail and in seclusion, his prestigious eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, terminally ill. It was left to the next son, a furious John of Gaunt, to fight back. He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics. In the next, \"Bad Parliament\", in 1377, a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt's steward, Thomas Hungerford, as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors' misdoings of the previous year. Gaunt evidently wanted a 'mirror-image' as his form of counter-coup and this notion, born in crisis, of one 'speaker', who quickly also became 'chairman' and organiser of the Commons' business, was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376-7. [PAR] On 6 October 1399, Sir John Cheyne of Beckford (Gloucester) was elected speaker. The powerful Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne's reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years. [PAR] Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament, with at least one contested election known, in 1420 (Roger Hunt prevailing by a majority of just four votes), in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted, indicating that the famous 'defence of the Commons' privilege' should not be seen in isolation as the principal thread in the office's evolution. Whilst the idea of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons' role, the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house's business and responses to the Crown's agenda, much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted. Thus, Whig ideas of the Commons growing in authority as against royal power",

The rider leading a classification at the end of a stage is required to wear  the corresponding jersey during the next stage. [PAR] Jerseys  are awarded in a ceremony immediately following the stage. Where a single rider leads in the competition for more than one jersey, they  wear the most prestigious jersey to which they are entitled, and the  second-placed rider in each of the other classifications becomes entitled to  wear the corresponding jersey. [PAR] Yellow Jersey [PAR] The yellow jersey, known in French as the maillot jaune, is worn by the overall time  leader, and is the most prized jersey. It is awarded by calculating the total combined race  time up to that point for each rider. The yellow jersey was first awarded in 1919 to make the race leader stand out. The color yellow was chosen because the pages of the race sponsor's magazine,  L'Auto, were yellow. [PAR] Green Jersey [PAR] The green jersey, known in French as the maillot vert, is awarded to the cyclist with the highest number of sprint points. Points for this jersey are gained by the riders who  finish first, second, etc., at the end of each stage. The number of points for each place and the number  of riders rewarded varies depending on the type of stage as the flatter stages are more likely to result in a sprint finish. Flat stages give the  winner 35 points down to 1 point for the 25th rider; medium mountain stages  give the winner 25 points down to 1 point for the 20th rider; high mountain  stages give the winner 20 points down to 1 point for the 15th rider. Points are also awarded for  individual time trial stages: 15 for the winner down to 1 for the 10th rider. Additional points are available at intermediate sprint contests, usually  occurring 2 or 3 times in each stage at pre-determined locations; currently 6,  4 and 2 points are available to the first 3 riders at each sprint. [PAR] Polka Dot  Jersey [PAR] The  winner of the King of the Mountain wears a white jersey with red  dots (known as the maillot \u00e0 pois rouges in French), which is commonly referred to as the \"polka dot jersey\". Although the best climber was first recognized in 1933 as the \"King of the Mountain\", the distinctive  polka dot jersey was not introduced until 1975. The colors were decided by the then  sponsor, Poulain Chocolate, to match a popular product. At the top of each climb in the Tour,  there are points awarded for the riders who are first over the top. The climbs are  divided into categories, from 1  to 4  based on  their difficulty with 1 being the most difficult, measured as a function of their steepness and length. A fifth  category, called Hors categorie (outside category) is formed by  mountains even more difficult than those of the number 1 category. In 2004, the  scoring system was changed so that the first rider over a fourth category  climb was awarded 3 points while the first to complete a hors category  climb would win 20 points. Further points over a fourth category climb are only  for the top three places while on a hors category climb the top ten riders are  rewarded. Also, beginning in 2004, the points scored on the final climb of  the day were doubled if such a climb was at least a second category climb.

For example, \u2018aleph\u2019 means \u2018ox\u2019, \u2018bet\u2019 means \u2018house\u2019 and \u2018gimmel\u2019 means \u2018throw stick\u2019.3 Early Greek letters are very similar and sometimes identical to the West Semitic letters.4 The letter sequence between the Semitic and Greek alphabets is identical. (Naveh 1982)\" and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. [PAR] In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era. [PAR] Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the 5th century BC and today. Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics. The traditional orthography, which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek, has many diacritics, such as accent marks for pitch accent (\"polytonic\"), the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial sound, and the iota subscript for the final historical sound. In standard Modern Greek spelling, orthography has been simplified to the monotonic system, which uses only two diacritics: the acute accent and diaeresis. [PAR] Letters  [PAR] Sound values  [PAR] In both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable. Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic. For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages.  [PAR] Among consonant letters, all letters that denoted voiced plosive consonants (/b, d, g/) and aspirated plosives (/p\u02b0, t\u02b0, k\u02b0/) in Ancient Greek stand for corresponding fricative sounds in Modern Greek. The correspondences are as follows: [PAR] Among the vowel symbols, Modern Greek sound values reflect the radical simplification of the vowel system of post-classical Greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into a much smaller number. This leads to several groups of vowel letters denoting identical sounds today. Modern Greek orthography remains true to the historical spellings in most of these cases. As a consequence, the spellings of words in Modern Greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable. [PAR] The following vowel letters and digraphs are involved in the mergers: [PAR] Modern Greek speakers typically use the same, modern, sound-symbol mappings in reading Greek of all historical stages. In other countries, students of Ancient Greek may use a variety of conventional approximations of the historical sound system in pronouncing Ancient Greek. [PAR] Digraphs and letter combinations  [PAR] Several letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components. Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized",

Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job.

A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation.

Amongst these were seven of the above colours, the purpose of which was to provide a guide to selecting appropriate shades.

In 1949 it published the Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration , which is discussed in another post.

To maintain semantic equivalence, the rephrased answer should also convey that \"argent\" represents the colour silver in heraldry.\n\n## Step 6: Generate the rewritten question and answer pair according to the guidelines\nThe question can be rephrased as: \"What colour is represented by the heraldic term 'argent' in the context of coats of arms and heraldic devices?\" This maintains the original query's intent while providing more context.\n\n## Step 7: Provide the correct answer and explanation in the required output format\nThe correct answer remains \"silver\". An appropriate explanation could be: \"In heraldry, 'argent' is a tincture that represents the colour silver. This is evident from the description of heraldic devices, such as Jane Seymour's Heraldic Panther, which is described as silver.\"\n\n## Step 8: Format the output as per the instructions\nThe output should be in the format: \n<output_format>\nQuestion: [Rephrased Question]\nExplanation: [Brief explanation of why the answer is correct]\nCorrect Answer: [Short answer]\n</output_format>\n\n## Step 9: Conduct the document analysis\n<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses heraldic colours and their meanings, providing historical background and examples. The question about \"argent\" is directly related to this context. The relevant information is found in the description of Jane Seymour's Heraldic Panther, indicating \"Argent\" is silver. The complexity of the question is moderate, as it requires understanding of heraldic terms. The question is purposeful as it tests knowledge of heraldic tinctures.\n</document_analysis>\n\n## Step 10: Finalize the output\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What colour is represented by the heraldic term 'argent' in the context of coats of arms and heraldic devices?\nExplanation: In heraldry, 'argent' represents the colour silver, as seen in descriptions of heraldic devices like Jane Seymour's Heraldic Panther.\nCorrect Answer: silver\n</output_format>\n\nThe final answer is: \n<output_format>\nQuestion: What colour is represented by the heraldic term 'argent' in the context of coats of arms and heraldic devices?\nExplanation: In heraldry, 'argent' represents the colour silver, as seen in descriptions of heraldic devices like Jane Seymour's Heraldic Panther.\nCorrect Answer: silver\n</output_format>",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Shipping ForecastThe Shipping Forecast is a BBC Radio broadcast of weather reports and forecasts for the seas around the coasts of the British Isles.  It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day. The broadcast finishes at approximately 0058. [PAR] * 0520 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from coastal stations at 0525, and an inshore waters forecast at 0527. [PAR] * 1201 \u2013 normally transmitted on LW only. [PAR] * 1754 \u2013 transmitted only on LW on weekdays, as an opt-out from the PM programme, but at weekends transmitted on both FM and LW. [PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.  [PAR] Region names [PAR] The 31 sea areas covering the waters around the British Isles are as defined by the map shown here: [PAR] * Viking [PAR] * North Utsire [PAR] * South Utsire [PAR] * Forties [PAR] * Cromarty [PAR] * Forth [PAR] * Tyne [PAR] * Dogger [PAR] * Fisher [PAR] * German Bight [PAR] * Humber [PAR] * Thames [PAR] * Dover [PAR] * Wight [PAR] * Portland [PAR] * Plymouth [PAR] * Biscay [PAR] * Trafalgar [PAR] * FitzRoy [PAR] * Sole [PAR] * Lundy [PAR] * Fastnet [PAR] * Irish Sea [PAR] * Shannon [PAR] * Rockall [PAR] * Malin [PAR] * Hebrides [PAR] * Bailey [PAR] * Fair Isle [PAR] * Faeroes [PAR] * Southeast Iceland [PAR] The areas were already roughly as listed above by 1949. Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe question asks for the Shipping Forecast Area where the Orkney Islands are located. The context provides a list of the 31 sea areas covering the waters around the British Isles. However, it does not directly state the area for the Orkney Islands. To answer this, one needs to infer or know the geographical location of the Orkney Islands relative to the listed sea areas. The Orkney Islands are located off the north coast of Scotland. Looking at the list of sea areas provided in the context (Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger, Fisher, German Bight, Humber, Thames, Dover, Wight, Portland, Plymouth, Biscay, Trafalgar, FitzRoy, Sole, Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea, Shannon, Rockall, Malin, Hebrides, Bailey, Fair Isle, Faeroes, Southeast Iceland), we can deduce that the Orkney Islands are likely to be near areas such as Cromarty, Fair Isle, or Viking, as these are in the northern part of the British Isles. The correct answer provided is \"Fair Isle.\" Fair Isle is indeed one of the sea areas and is located between the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands, making it a plausible area for the Orkney Islands to be associated with, although the Orkney Islands are more directly associated with the \"Cromarty\" area or potentially \"Wikisng\" or \"Fair Isle\" depending on the exact context of the question.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] GreenpeaceGreenpeace is a non-governmental  environmental  organization with offices in over 40 countries and with an international coordinating body in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Founded by Canadian environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace states its goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity\"  and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants.   Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  and is a founding member  of the INGO Accountability Charter; an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations. [PAR] Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world.   Greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge,    and influenced both the private and the public sector.   Greenpeace has also been a source of controversy;  its motives and methods (some of the latter being illegal) have received criticism,  including an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The organization's direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists,   such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat[http://www.biofortified.org/2013/06/gmo-crops-vandalized-in-oregon/ GMO crops vandalized in Oregon], Karl Haro von Mogel, Biology Fortified, 24 June 2013. and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site in Peru.  [PAR] History [PAR] Origins [PAR] In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000  people blocked a major U.S.\u2013Canadian border crossing in British Columbia, carrying signs reading \"Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes\".  The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb. [PAR] While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opposers were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. As members of the Sierra Club Canada, they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization. From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, \"bearing witness\", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence. Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club. The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay St. became the HQ.  As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, Greenpeace, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's \"quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance\". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.  Within half a year Greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in Kitsilano.  [PAR] Irving Stowe arranged a benefit concert (supported by Joan Baez) that took place on October 16, 1970 at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver. The concert created the financial basis for the first Greenpeace campaign.  Amchitka, the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace was",

[PAR] They are the elements Fluorine, ( atomic number 9 ),\u00a0 Chlorine, ( atomic number 17 ), Bromine ( atomic number 35 ), Iodine ( atomic number 53 ), Astatine\u00a0 ( atomic number 85 ), and a newly discovered element not yet given a name, that has an atomic number of 117, ( Discovered in 2010). [PAR] However both Astatine and Element No. 117 are too radioactive to be made in quantities that can be weighed. They are man made elements that have very short half lives;\u00a0 so decay into other elements before one has the chance to make any of their compounds. So in most laboratories Halogen chemistry is essentially about the study of Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine & Iodine. [PAR] The word Halogen was coined in 1842 by the Swedish Chemist Berzelius ( 1779 - 1848 ). It is a made up Swedish word which literally means \"Salt producer\" in Swedish. A name in keeping with the reactive nature of these elements. Lots of Halogen salts are known. Eg. Sodium chloride. Potassium fluoride. Sodium Bromide. [PAR] \u00a0These elements are all members of the same group, because all of their atoms have the same number of electrons in their outermost shell or orbit. Group 17 elements all have 7 electrons in their outermost orbit. [PAR] \u200b [PAR] \u200bThe Periodic Table highlighting Group 17. [PAR] Fluorine [PAR] As mentioned previously fluorine has an atomic number of 9. This means that an atom of fluorine will have in addition to 9 protons in the nucleus of its atom, it will have a total of 9 electrons orbiting its nucleus. An individual\u00a0 proton always has a charge of +1 and an individual electron always has a charge of -1. [PAR] We have 9 protons in an atom of fluorine each having a charge of +1, plus 9 electrons in that same atom orbiting the nucleus of that atom. [PAR] ( +1 X 9 ) + (-1 X 9 ) = 0. [PAR] \u00a0So the atom is electrically neutral. [PAR] This is true for all neutral atoms of fluorine. [PAR] The 9 electrons are arranged in 2 shells or orbit.\u00a0 2 of the 9 electrons orbit in the 1st shell or orbit. The remaining 7 electrons orbit in a larger shell. [PAR] The 7 electrons in the outermost orbit of all Halogens are the electrons that participate in chemical reactions. During chemical reactions the number of electrons in the outermost orbit can go up or down. Up to a max of 8, and down to 0 ( in theory ). Compare with\u00a0 Na+1 or with Li+1 [PAR] \u200b [PAR] Written Feb 7, 2016 [PAR] The halogens are the family of chemical elements that includes fluorine (atomic symbol F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). The halogens make up Group VIIA of the Periodic Table of the elements. Elemental halogens are diatomic molecules. However, due to their high reactivity, the halogens are never found in nature in native form. The family name means \"salt-forming,\" from the Greek for salt, \"hals\", and for generating \"genes\". The salinity of the oceans on Earth is due in large part to such halogen salts (halides) as sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium iodide (KI). [PAR] Halogens display physical and chemical properties typical of nonmetals. They have relatively low melting and boiling points that increase steadily down the group. Near room temperature, the halogens span all of the physical states: Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. All of the elements are colored, with the color becoming more intense moving down the group. Fluorine gas is pale yellow, and chlorine gas is a yellowish green. Liquid bromine and its vapors are brownish red. Solid iodine appears as shiny",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)The Speaker of the House of Commons is the presiding officer of the House of Commons, the United Kingdom's lower chamber of Parliament. The office is currently held by John Bercow, who was initially elected on 22 June 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin. He was returned as an MP in the 2010 general election and was re-elected as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2010. He was again returned as an MP in the 2015 general election and was re-elected, unopposed, as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2015.  [PAR] The Speaker presides over the House's debates, determining which members may speak. The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries, the Speaker remains strictly non-partisan, and renounces all affiliation with his or her former political party when taking office as well as when leaving the office. The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to Speaker Denison's rule). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions, and remains a constituency Member of Parliament (MP). The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker's House at the Palace of Westminster.  [PAR] History [PAR] The office of Speaker is almost as old as Parliament itself. The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258, when Peter de Montfort presided over the Parliament held in Oxford. Early presiding officers were known by the title parlour or prolocutor. The continuous history of the office of Speaker is held to date from 1376  when Sir Peter de la Mare spoke for the commons in the \"Good Parliament\" as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of the Crown and the most unpopular members of the king's household. Edward III was frail and in seclusion, his prestigious eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, terminally ill. It was left to the next son, a furious John of Gaunt, to fight back. He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics. In the next, \"Bad Parliament\", in 1377, a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt's steward, Thomas Hungerford, as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors' misdoings of the previous year. Gaunt evidently wanted a 'mirror-image' as his form of counter-coup and this notion, born in crisis, of one 'speaker', who quickly also became 'chairman' and organiser of the Commons' business, was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376-7. [PAR] On 6 October 1399, Sir John Cheyne of Beckford (Gloucester) was elected speaker. The powerful Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne's reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years. [PAR] Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament, with at least one contested election known, in 1420 (Roger Hunt prevailing by a majority of just four votes), in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted, indicating that the famous 'defence of the Commons' privilege' should not be seen in isolation as the principal thread in the office's evolution. Whilst the idea of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons' role, the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house's business and responses to the Crown's agenda, much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted. Thus, Whig ideas of the Commons growing in authority as against royal power",

The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality:  of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for machine-made paper, while quires of 24 sheets are often used for handmade or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets. ) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, depending on the type of paper.  [PAR] Nomenclature [PAR] The current word \"quire\" derives from OE \"quair\" or \"guaer\", from OF \"quayer\", \"cayer\", (cf. modern Fr. cahier), from L. quaternum, \"by fours\", \"fourfold\". Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the association of \"quaire\" with \"four\" was quickly lost. [PAR] History [PAR] In the Middle Ages, a quire (also called a \"gathering\") was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term \"quaternion\" (or sometimes quaternum) designates such a quire. A quire made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a \"bifolium\" (plural \"bifolia\"); a \"binion\" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a \"quinion\" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian term for quire, quinterno di carta. [PAR] Formerly, when paper was packed at the paper mill, the top and bottom quires were made up of slightly damaged sheets (\"outsides\") to protect the good quires (\"insides\"). These outside quires were known as \"cassie quires\" (from Fr. cass\u00e9e, \"broken\"), or \"cording quires\" and had only 20 sheets to the quire.  The printer William Caslon in a book published in 1770 mentions both 24- and 25-sheet quires; he also details printer's wastage, and the sorting and recycling of damaged cassie quires.  An 1826 French manual on typography complained that cording quires (usually containing some salvageable paper) from the Netherlands barely contained a single good sheet.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Tony BlairAnthony Charles Lynton Blair (born 6 May 1953) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007. Together with then-US President George W. Bush, he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq, an act which remains highly controversial.   [PAR] From 1983 to 2007, Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under Blair's leadership, the party used the phrase \"New Labour\", to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism. Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity.  Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism.  [PAR] In May 1997, the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory, the largest in its history, allowing Blair, at 43 years old, to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In September 1997, Blair attained early personal popularity, receiving a 93% public approval rating, after his public response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.    The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership: in 2001, in which it won another landslide victory, and in 2005, with a reduced majority. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act, and Freedom of Information Act. Blair's government also carried out the devolution, the establishing of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto. In Northern Ireland, Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. [PAR] Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration, and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and, more controversially, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq, including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression.  In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary. [PAR] Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007, and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown.  On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East, which he held until 27 May 2015. He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name, including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.  [PAR] Early life [PAR] Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland,  on 6 May 1953,   the second son of Leo and Hazel ( Corscadden) Blair. Leo Blair, the illegitimate  son of two English actors, had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife, Mary. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and later died in) Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1923, where his wife, Sarah Margaret (n\u00e9e Lipsett), gave birth to Blair's mother, Hazel, above the family's grocery shop.  [PAR] Blair has one elder brother, Sir William Blair, a High Court judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh. [PAR] In the 1950s, his family spent three and a half years in Adelaide, South Australia, where his father was a lecturer in law at the University of Adelaide.  The Blairs lived close to the",

    "orig_answer": "letter",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical noteIn music, the term note has three primary meanings: [PAR] #A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound (\u266a, \u266b); [PAR] #A pitched sound itself. [PAR] #A pitch class. [PAR] Notes are the \"atoms\" of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.  [PAR] The term note can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\".  In the former case, one uses note to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: Key signature names and translations.) [PAR] Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class. [PAR] In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si, including for instance Italy, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details).  [PAR] The eighth note, or octave, is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of scientific pitch notation combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440\u00a0Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4. [PAR] There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the Helmholtz pitch notation and the scientific pitch notation. [PAR] Accidentals  [PAR] Letter names are modified by the accidentals. A sharp  raises a note by a semitone or half-step, and a flat  lowers it by the same amount. In modern tuning a half step has a frequency ratio of \\sqrt[12]{2}, approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F represents F-sharp, B is B-flat. [PAR] Additional accidentals are the double-sharp , raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat , lowering it by that amount. [PAR] In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the key signature, which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the natural symbol , is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G-sharp, a local flat before a G makes it G-flat (not G natural), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat () to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp  sign on a key signature with a single sharp  indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp. [PAR] Assuming enharmonicity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B is equal to the note C. Assuming",

The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. [PAR] Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

    "orig_answer": "red",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ColorColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perceptual property corresponding in humans to the categories called red, blue, yellow, etc. Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power versus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the light receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects or materials based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By defining a color space colors can be identified numerically by their coordinates. [PAR] Because perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of different types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum, colors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these cells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not fully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance. [PAR] The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what we commonly refer to simply as light). [PAR] Physics of color  [PAR] Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\". [PAR] Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called metamers of the color in question. [PAR] Spectral colors  [PAR] The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum \u2013 named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671 \u2013 include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see refractive index). [PAR] The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list \u2013 the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to perceive colors in the same way ). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today we call cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported at the time.  [PAR] The intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive-green. [PAR] Color of objects  [PAR] The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contribute to the color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the",

    "orig_answer": "siam",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] The King and IThe King and I is a musical, the fifth by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II.  It is based on the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon, which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s.  The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country.  The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love that neither can admit.  The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St. James Theatre.  It ran nearly three years, then the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history, and has had many tours and revivals. [PAR] In 1950, theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client, veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence.  Holtzmann realized that Landon's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein, who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical.  The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King, a role that he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon's book, but he was unavailable.  They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner. [PAR] The musical was an immediate hit, winning Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Actress (for Lawrence) and Best Featured Actor (for Brynner).  Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening, and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances.  A hit London run and U.S. national tour followed, together with a 1956 film for which Brynner won an Academy Award, and the musical was recorded several times.  In later revivals, Brynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in a 1985 Broadway run shortly before his death. [PAR] Christopher Renshaw directed major revivals on Broadway (1996), winning the  Tony Award for Best Revival, and in the West End (2000). A 2015 Broadway revival won another Tony for Best Revival. Both professional and amateur revivals of The King and I continue to be staged regularly throughout the English-speaking world. [PAR] Historical background  [PAR] Mongkut, King of Siam, was about 57 years old in 1861.  He had lived half his life as a Buddhist monk and was an able scholar, founding a new order of Buddhism and a temple in Bangkok (paid for by his half-brother, King Nangklao). Through his decades of devotion, Mongkut acquired an ascetic lifestyle and a firm grasp of Western languages. When Nangklao died in 1850, Mongkut became king.  At that time, various European countries were striving for dominance, and American traders sought greater influence, in Southeast Asia.

[PAR] In Greek mythology, Pandora (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1)(\"all gifted\") was the first woman, fashioned by Zeus as part of the punishment of mankind for Prometheus ' theft of the secret of fire. [PAR] Hesiod , in his Works and Days, ca. 700 BC, has a very early version of the Pandora story. [ 1 ] [PAR] Creation of Pandora: Zeus, Hermes, Epimetheus and Pandora [PAR] The legend [PAR] The titan Epimetheus (\"hindsight\") was responsible for giving a positive trait to each and every animal. However, when it was time to give man a positive trait, there was nothing left. Prometheus (\"foresight\"), his brother, felt that because man was superior to all other animals, man should have a gift no other animal possessed. So Prometheus set forth to steal fire from Zeus and handed it over to man. [PAR] Zeus was enraged and decided to punish Prometheus and his creation: mankind. To punish Prometheus, Zeus chained him in unbreakable fetters and set an eagle over him to eat his liver each day, as the eagle is Zeus' sacred animal. Prometheus was an immortal, so the liver grew back every day, but he was still tormented daily from the pain, until he was freed by Heracles during The Twelve Labours. [PAR] To punish mankind, Zeus ordered the other gods to make Pandora as a poisoned gift for man. Pandora was given several traits from the different gods: Hephaestus molded her out of clay and gave her form; Athena clothed her and adorned her with necklaces made by Hephaestus as well as taught her manual dexterity and how to spin; Aphrodite gave her beauty; Apollo gave her musical talent and a gift for healing; Demeter taught her to tend a garden; Poseidon gave her a pearl necklace and the ability to never drown; Zeus made her idle, mischievous, and foolish; Hera gave her curiosity; Hermes, along with giving her cunning, boldness and charm, then gave Pandora a box. The name Pandora, thus, derives from the fact she's received gifts from all deities: \"all gifts\". [PAR] Pandora Vase [PAR] Before he was chained to the rock, Prometheus had warned Epimetheus not to take any gifts from the gods. Epimetheus did not listen to his brother, however, and when Pandora arrived, he fell in love with her. Hermes told him that Pandora was a gift to the titan from Zeus, and he warned Epimetheus to not open the box, which was Pandora's dowry. [PAR] Until then, mankind had lived a life in a paradise without worry. Epimetheus told Pandora never to open the box she had received from Zeus. However, one day, Pandora's curiosity got the better of her and she opened it, releasing all the misfortunes of mankind (plague, sorrow, poverty, crime, etc.). Once opened, she shut it in time to keep one thing in the box: hope 1. The world remained extremely bleak for an unspecified interval, until Pandora \"chanced\" to revisit the box again, at which point Hope fluttered out. Thus, mankind always has hope in times of evil, but Hope has a great deal of catching up to do. (See also Garden of Eden.) [PAR] The daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora was Pyrrha , who married Deucalion and was one of the two who survived the deluge. [PAR] Epimetheus and Pandora, El Greco [PAR] Commentary [PAR] The story of Pandora's Box can be interpreted in more than one way, but one obvious moral is that of \"curiosity killed the cat\". [PAR] Some scholars 2 contend that Pandora's \"box\" may have been a mistranslation, and her \"box\" may have been a large jar or vase, forged from the earth. In fact, there is evidence 3 that suggests Pandora herself was the jar. In Ancient Greece jars commonly bore images of women. The jar was said 4 to have been in a jar form because of the similarites between a jar and a woman's uterus. [PAR] The",

    "orig_answer": "beryllium",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term \"element\" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms \"elementary substance\" and \"simple substance\" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\") share recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity. [PAR] Description [PAR] The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe  in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),   along with tiny traces of",

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry.

    "orig_question": "To what does the adjective 'lutrine' refer?",
    "orig_answer": "lutrinae",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] OtterOtter is a common name for a carnivorous mammal in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the weasel family Mustelidae, which also includes badgers, honey badgers, martens, minks, polecats, weasels and wolverines. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This, and cognate words in other Indo-European languages, ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European language root *w\u00f3dr\u0325, which also gave rise to the English word \"water\".   [PAR] Terminology [PAR] An otter's den is called a holt or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars, females are called bitches or sows, and their offspring are called pups.  The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp (being descriptive of their often playful nature) or, when in water, raft.   [PAR] The feces of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish;[http://archive.today/20120908081151/http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm Spraint Analysis]. ottersite.btinternet.co.uk these are known as spraints.  [PAR] Life cycle [PAR] The gestation period in otters is about 60 to 86 days.  The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog and older offspring.  Bitch otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years.  The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland.  It is lined with moss and grass. [PAR] After one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim.  The pup lives with its family for approximately one year.  Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups.  Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds. [PAR] Characteristics [PAR] Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from  in length and 1 to in weight. The Oriental small-clawed otter is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water. [PAR] Several otter species live in cold waters and have high metabolic rates to help keep them warm. European otters must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and sea otters 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as 10 \u00b0C, an otter needs to catch 100 g of fish per hour to survive. Most species hunt for three to five hours each day and nursing mothers up to eight hours each day. [PAR] For most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, crayfish and crabs.  Some otters are expert at opening shellfish, and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of clams, sea urchins and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their stomachs. This skill must be learned by the young.  [PAR] Otters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic and live in the ocean for most of their lives. [PAR] Otters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and",

    "orig_answer": "st trinian",
    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] St Trinian's SchoolSt Trinian's was a British gag cartoon comic strip series, created and drawn by Ronald Searle from 1946 until 1952.  The cartoons all centre on a boarding school for girls, where the teachers are sadists and the girls are juvenile delinquents. The series was Searle's most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films that has outlived the short-running cartoon series. [PAR] Concept [PAR] The first cartoon appeared in 1941, but shortly afterwards Searle had to fulfil his military service. He was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 he started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was a lot darker in comparison with the previous years. [PAR] The school is the antithesis of the type of posh girls' boarding school depicted by Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil; its female pupils are bad and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the uniform of the school that Searle's daughter Kate attended, JAGS in Dulwich. The films implied that the girls were the daughters of gangsters, crooks, shady bookmakers, and other low-lifes and the institution is often referred to as a \"female borstal\". [PAR] The inspiration [PAR] During 1941 Searle had left for the artist's community in the village of Kirkcudbright in Edinburgh and it was whilst visiting the family Johnston there that he made a drawing to please their two schoolgirl daughters, C\u00e9cil\u00e9 and Pat, (their school had been evacuated to New Gala House in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders owing to the war), and Searle was puzzled as to why two schoolgirls should seem so keen to return to their school, an Academy for Young Ladies in Dalkeith Road \u2014 the name of their school was St Trinnean's.   [PAR] Searle's St. Trinian's was based on two independent girls' schools in Cambridge\u2014Perse School for Girls, now known as the co-educational Stephen Perse Foundation, and St Mary's School. Searle, growing up in Cambridge, saw the girls on their way to and from school on a regular basis and they were the original inspiration for the cartoons and the character. Testaments to this fact can be found in the Perse School for Girls' Archive area where there are several original  St Trinian's books, given to the school by Ronald Searle. He also based the school partly on the former Cambridgeshire High School for Girls (now Long Road Sixth Form College).  [PAR] Books [PAR] * Hurrah for St Trinian's (1948) [PAR] * The Female Approach (1950) [PAR] * Back to the Slaughterhouse (1952) [PAR] * The Terror of St Trinians or Angela's Prince Charming (1952; text by Timothy Shy, pen-name for D. B. Wyndham-Lewis) [PAR] * Souls in Torment (1953) [PAR] Films [PAR] In the 1950s, a series of St Trinians comedy films was made featuring well-known British actors including Alastair Sim (in drag as the headmistress, but also playing her brother), George Cole as spiv \"Flash Harry\", Joyce Grenfell as Sgt Ruby Gates, a beleaguered policewoman, and Richard Wattis and Eric Barker as the civil servants at the Ministry of Education for whom the school is a source of constant frustration and nervous breakdowns.  Searle's cartoons appeared in the films' main title design. [PAR] In the films the school became embroiled in various shady enterprises, thanks mainly to Flash, and, as a result, was always threatened with closure by the Ministry. (In the last of the original four, this became the \"Ministry of Schools\", possibly because of fears of a libel action from a real Minister of Education.)

The state is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the United States. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Tallahassee is the state capital. [PAR] A peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida, it has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately 1350 mi, and is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. The American alligator, American crocodile, Florida panther, and manatee can be found in the Everglades National Park. [PAR] Since the first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u00a0\u2013 who named it La Florida ( \"land of flowers\") upon landing there in the Easter season, Pascua Florida \u00a0\u2013 Florida was a challenge for the European colonial powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Native Americans, and racial segregation after the American Civil War. [PAR] Today, Florida is distinctive for its large Cuban expatriate community and high population growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues. The state's economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also renown for amusement parks, orange crops, the Kennedy Space Center, and as a popular destination for retirees. [PAR] Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and Latino, and African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine.

The context does not directly answer the question as phrased but implies Meryl Streep's prominence in Oscar nominations.\n\nTo align with the question's requirement and the context's information, a more appropriate question might directly relate to Meryl Streep's record-breaking nominations.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: Which actress holds the record for the most Academy Award nominations, having been nominated 15 times as noted in the context of Best Actress Oscar records?\nExplanation: Meryl Streep is identified in the context as having 15 nominations, the highest number mentioned, making her the actress with the most Academy Award nominations among those listed.\nCorrect Answer: Meryl Streep\n</output_format>",

Image courtesy of the National Library of Australia: an24493323 [PAR] Australians are not renowned for rushing into major decisions\u2014change is usually a slow and considered process. The journey towards choosing our own national anthem was no exception. [PAR] The move to replace God Save the Queen with an anthem unique to Australia began as early as the 1820s. Over the decades, public opinion has been constantly canvassed and numerous competitions held to find a suitable song. [PAR] Peter Dodds McCormick's Advance Australia Fair was officially declared Australia's national anthem by the Governor-General on 19 April 1984, close to 160 years after the first alternative anthems were put forward. The song was first performed in Sydney in 1878 and, interestingly, was sung at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia by a choir of 10,000 people. [PAR] Some early nominations [PAR] John Dunmore Lang, who published an Australian Anthem and an Australian Hymn in 1826, was an early advocate of a distinctively Australian anthem. South Australian Carl Linger wrote Song of Australia in 1860, which was suggested to the (then) Prime Minister in 1929 as a possible national anthem. Linger's composition remained a favourite with Australians and was on the shortlist of 'possibles' 117 years later when Australians voted for an anthem at a national poll. [PAR] The lead-up to change [PAR] The issue of the anthem provoked more and more debate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission held two competitions in 1943 and 1945, and the 1951 Commonwealth Jubilee celebrations competition was won by Henry Krips with This Land of Mine. The 1956 Olympic Games, staged in Melbourne, sparked a fresh and passionate debate about the need for a truly Australian anthem.

Advance Australia Fair polled 51.4 per cent, prompting the (then) Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, to announce that it would become our national anthem. [PAR] After some intense political debate, a national poll was conducted in 1977 with over seven million people issued with ballot papers.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Washington (state)Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States located north of Oregon, west of Idaho, and south of the Canadian province of British Columbia on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Named after George Washington, the first President of the United States, the state was made out of the western part of the Washington Territory, which had been ceded by Britain in 1846 in accordance with the Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon Boundary Dispute.  It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital.  Washington is sometimes referred to as Washington State or the State of Washington to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington. [PAR] Washington is the 18th largest with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people.  Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west, mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast and far southeast, and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California.  Mount Rainier is the state's highest elevation at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 m). [PAR] Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. [PAR] Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The Washington Territory was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The area was originally part of a region called the Columbia District after the Columbia River. Incidentally, the area was renamed Washington in order to avoid confusion with the District of Columbia, which contains the city of Washington.  [PAR] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president. To distinguish it from the U.S. capital, which is also named for George Washington, Washington is sometimes referred to as \"Washington State\", or, in more formal contexts, as \"the State of Washington\". Washingtonians and other residents of the Pacific Northwest refer to the state simply as \"Washington\", calling the nation's capital \"Washington, D.C.\" or, more often, simply \"D.C.\". [PAR] Geography [PAR] Washington is the northwestern-most state of the contiguous United States. Its northern border lies mostly along the 49th parallel, and then via marine boundaries through the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait and Strait of Juan de Fuca, with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. Washington is bordered by Oregon to the south, with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the southern boundary. [PAR] To the east, Washington borders Idaho, bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the confluence of the Snake River and Clearwater River (about 116\u00b057' west), except for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Carry On (franchise)The Carry On franchise primarily consists of a sequence of 31 low-budget British comedy motion pictures (1958\u201392), four Christmas specials, a television series of thirteen episodes, and three West End and provincial stage plays. The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. [PAR] The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978\u201392). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958\u201366), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967\u201392). [PAR] Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u201362) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u201374). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. [PAR] All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. [PAR] Background [PAR] \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". [PAR] The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.) [PAR] The stock-in-trade of Carry On humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (Nurse, Doctor, Again Doctor, Matron), the monarchy (Henry), the Empire (Up the Khyber), the armed forces (Sergeant) and the trade unions (At Your Convenience) as well as the Hammer horror film (Screaming), camping (Camping), foreigners (Abroad), beauty contests (Girls), and caravan holidays (Behind) among others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they proved very popular with audiences.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provided is about the Carry On franchise, a series of British comedy films, television series, and stage plays. The question asks for the title of a Carry On film set in an establishment called Paradise. To answer this, we need to identify a film in the series that matches this description. Upon examining the context, we find that \"Carry On Camping\" is mentioned, which involves a camping setting. The context states that the stock-in-trade of Carry On humour includes \"camping (Camping)\" among other themes, indicating that \"Carry On Camping\" is indeed a film in the series.
