Eternal. Sublime. Taj Mahal \u2013 a 17th-century mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra \u2013 is a gleaming symbol of love, devotion, and craftsmanship. Erected by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to cherish the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, it truly is \u201clove wrought in stones.\u201d Literally meaning \u201cCrown Palace\u201d, it is guarded by four slender marble minarets and emblazoned with verses taken from Quran. The eminence of sanctity oozes out from each marble pore. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal is a symbol of enduring love, built by the Emperor Shah Jahan to memorialize his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is a mausoleum made of white marble, in which the Emperor had his wife entombed, and after his own death, Emperor Shah Jahan was entombed next to his wife. [PAR] In the official history of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign, written by Abdul Hamid Lahori in his book Badshahnama, he mentions the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara, which means the illumined or famous tomb. [PAR] Designed in the Mughal Empire style with touches of Persian influence and delicate designs, there is an entire complex that surrounds the mausoleum. The main building was completed in 1648, however, the surrounding architectural forms took five years for completion. The complex includes gardens, fountains, and a reflecting pool, which reflects the image of the Taj Mahal. [PAR] The white-colored tomb rests on a square plinth and comprises of a symmetrical building with an arch-shaped doorway crowned by a large dome and finial. The original finial was constructed of gold, but it was replicated by a bronze model in the early 19th century. The top of the tomb is embellished with a lotus design, mixing the Persian and the Indian architectural styles. The recherch\u00e9 inlay work and elaborate craftsmanship together with the calligraphy leaves one utterly fascinated. For the interior inlay work, Shah Jahan preferred to use precious and semi-precious stones. [PAR] Four minarets, each more than 40 meters tall, recall the traditional component of the mosques. The minarets were constructed somewhat outside the plinth to avoid damage that may occur if any minaret falls. [PAR] Passages from the Quran can be seen bedecking the walls of the entire complex. These passages refer to the day of judgement. [PAR] Over the centuries, the monument of love has been experiencing neglect and is deteriorating. During the early 20th century, a major restoration of this wonder took place. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is now in danger due to excessive pollution. The restoration works undertaken by the government are slow. [PAR] After a tour of the Taj Mahal, visitors feel hungry. There are many eating joints near the Taj Mahal. Some of the food joints include the Silk Route Restaurant, Zorba The Buddha, Olive Garden, and Capri Restaurant.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] NATO phonetic alphabetThe International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet and also known as the ICAO radiotelephonic, phonetic or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet. Although often called \"phonetic alphabets\", spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel. [PAR] The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot,  Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu. [PAR] International adoption [PAR] After the phonetic alphabet was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  (see history below) it was adopted by many other international and national organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU). [PAR] It is a subset of the much older International Code of Signals (INTERCO), which originally included visual signals by flags or flashing light, sound signals by whistle, siren, foghorn, or bell, as well as one, two, or three letter codes for many phrases.  The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numeric words (Zero, One, with some alternative pronunciations), whereas the IMO provides for compound numeric words (Nadazero, Unaone, Bissotwo...).  In practice these are used very rarely, as they frequently result in confusion between speakers of different languages. [PAR] NATO [PAR] A common name for this spelling alphabet, \"NATO phonetic alphabet,\" exists because it appears in Allied Tactical Publication ATP-1, Volume II: Allied Maritime Signal and Maneuvering Book used by all allied navies of NATO, which adopted a modified form of the International Code of Signals. Because the latter allows messages to be spelled via flags or Morse code, it naturally named the code words used to spell out messages by voice its \"phonetic alphabet\". The name NATO phonetic alphabet became widespread because the signals used to facilitate the naval communications and tactics of NATO have become global.  [PAR] However, ATP-1 is marked NATO Confidential (or the lower NATO Restricted) so it is not available publicly. Nevertheless, a NATO unclassified version of the document is provided to foreign, even hostile, militaries, even though they are not allowed to make it available publicly. The spelling alphabet is now also defined in other unclassified international military documents.  [PAR] The NATO alphabet appeared in some United States Air Force Europe publications during the Cold War. A particular example was the Ramstein Air Base, Telephone Directory published between 1969 and 1973 (currently out of print). The American and NATO versions had differences and the translation was provided as a convenience. Differences included Alfa, Bravo and Able, Baker for the first two letters. [PAR] History [PAR] The ICAO developed this system in the 1950s in order to account for discrepancies that might arise in communications as a result of multiple alphabet naming systems coexisting in different places and organizations.  [PAR] In the official   version of the alphabet, the non-English spellings Alfa and Juliett are used. Alfa is spelled with an f as it is in most European languages because the English and French spelling alpha would not be pronounced properly by native speakers of some other languages \u2013 who may not know that ph should be pronounced as f.\u00a0 Juliett is spelled with a tt",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Trivial PursuitTrivial Pursuit is a board game in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette, and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press. After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing, they decided to create their own game.  With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982.  [PAR] In North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.  , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by Games magazine. An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003. [PAR] Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as Star Wars, Saturday Night Live, and The Lord of the Rings movies). [PAR] Gameplay [PAR] The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit, these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die. [PAR] Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections, similar to a pie. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,  can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress. [PAR] During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, their turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board. [PAR] Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece, he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Canada Population (2016) - World Population ReviewCanada  Population (2016) - World Population Review [PAR] World Population Review [PAR] Canada  Population 2016 [PAR] [[getCurrentPopulation()]] [PAR] In 2016, Canada has an estimated population of 36.04 million, which ranks 38th in the world. Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area and the largest North American country. Canada extends from the Pacific to the Atlantic and north to the Arctic Ocean. The United States-Canadian border is the longest land border in the world. [PAR] Canada's most recent census was conducted in 2016, but the official results will not be released until early 2017. Prior to 2016, the last census was completed in Canada on May 10 2011. Preliminary figures released on 8 February 2012 showed that the officially recorded population of Canada was 33,476,688. Canada is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, with much of its land inhospitable. The country's population density is under 4 people per square kilometer, which ranks 228th in the world. [PAR] Rapid Population Growth [PAR] As you can see from the chart below, Canada's population has tripled since the 1940s, growing from 11 million at the time of the second world war to over 36 million today. [PAR] Population growth has been fairly consistent over the past fifty years and shows no sign of slowing. Between the last census in 2006 and 2011, the number of people in Canada increased by an impressive 5.9%. Current estimates show that the population has increased an addition 7.5% since 2011. [PAR] Canada's growth is fueled largely by immigration. In fact, relative to its size, Canada is the largest importer of human capital in the Group of Eight, attracting even more immigrants per capita than the USA. Natural population growth, by contrast, accounts for only around one-tenth of Canada's overall population increase each year. Worldwide, Canada is 9th in crude net migration rate. [PAR] Given the large geographical area of Canada and its relative affluence, it is likely that its population will continue to grow rapidly for decades to come, leading some to speculate as to what a Canada of 100 million people might look like, and whether increased population combined with unrivaled access to natural resources would make Canada a global superpower. [PAR] Canada's Population by Province and Territory [PAR] The census results also show the population of each Canadian province and territory. More than half of Canadians live in just two provinces; Ontario, where one in three Canadians live, and Quebec where almost a quarter of Canadians live. The combined population of Canada's three territories (Northwest, Yukon and Nunavut) is less than the population of Canada's smallest province (Prince Edward Island). [PAR] Province/Territory [PAR] 0.1% [PAR] Largest Cities in Canada [PAR] The largest city in Canada by population is Toronto, home to 2,615,060 people at the time of the 2011 census, and an estimated 2.8 million in 2016. The wider Toronto metropolitan area is over twice as populous, containing around 6 million people in total. [PAR] Canada's second largest city is Montreal in Quebec, where 1,649,519 people live, followed in third place by Calgary in Alberta with 1,096,833. Calgary is growing at almost twice the Canadian average, so if current trends continue it will no doubt overtake Montreal in the future. Ottawa is Canada's fourth largest city \u2013 883,391 people live in the capital city. [PAR] The fastest growing large city between 2006 and 2011 was Brampton, Ontario. In the 5 year period, the city grew by nearly 21% en route to surpassing 500,000 residents. Montreal is the slowest growing major city in Canada, with growth of just 1.8% from 2006 to 2011. By comparison, Canada itself grew by 5.9% during the 5 year period. [PAR] Canada Population Density [PAR] As you can see from the map, the majority of Canadians live in a narrow Southern belt along the border with the United States. There are two main reasons for this. [PAR] The first, and most important, is that the most hospitable part of Canadian territory is in the south. Summers are warm and winters are not too harsh, making the area suitable",

    "response": "```markdown\n<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed look into the complexity of Canada's economic and demographic landscape, emphasizing significant population growth. To generate a challenging and insightful question, I analyzed the key points: the document discusses the implications of Canada's geopolitical and demographic characteristics on its economic development, with a specific focus on the role of immigration, historical trends, and population density. It is crucial to note the document's discussion of the factors influencing population growth, such as the impact of immigration and migration patterns on economic development. This creates an intricate web of interactions between demographic shifts and economic growth.\n\nThe complexity is evaluated by considering the historical and current data on the population density, growth patterns, and their impact on economic factors. The question should encourage deep reflection on the influence of population growth on economic development, considering both theoretical and practical aspects. The aim is to challenge the expert's understanding of demographic transitions and their economic implications.\n\nThe context's central theme is the intersection of population growth and economic development, particularly through the lens of immigration and its impact on economic growth. The document provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles of economic growth theories and how immigration patterns influence economic structures. It discusses the potential for increased productivity due to high-skilled immigration and the economic implications of demographic shifts. The analysis phase reveals the complexity of the document by focusing on the role of population growth and the nuanced interplay between demographic changes and economic outcomes.\n\nStrategically, the question should explore the nuanced implications of population dynamics, migration, and economic growth. The difficulty is enhanced by focusing on the relationship between population growth and economic output, challenging the expert to consider how demographic changes influence broader economic outcomes. The question is framed to probe the implications of population growth on economic growth, considering population growth rates and the economic impact of immigration on Canada's economy.\n\nThe final question will require domain experts to consider the economic implications of population dynamics, specifically how they impact fiscal policy and macroeconomic growth.

It explores the potential impacts of immigration on the economy, requiring a nuanced understanding of the relationship between population dynamics and economic policy.\n\nCorrect Answer: Significant shifts in immigration patterns, especially involving high-skilled immigrants, can have profound effects on a nation's economic growth, budgetary outcomes, and fiscal policies. The influx of highly skilled immigrants can boost productivity, potentially leading to changes in fiscal policies aimed at optimizing economic outputs. This requires domain expertise in economics, demography, and public policy to properly address the question of how changes in immigration patterns influence fiscal policy and budgetary outcomes.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] U.S. stateA state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). [PAR] States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. [PAR] States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  [PAR] States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. [PAR] States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state.  [PAR] The Constitution grants to Congress  the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. [PAR] The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw from) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v. White, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.   [PAR] States of the United States [PAR] The 50 U.S. states (in alphabetical order), along with state flag and date each joined the union: [PAR] Governments [PAR] As each state is itself a sovereign entity, it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. [PAR] Constitutions [PAR] The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The Constitution of Alabama, for example, contains 310,296 words \u2014 more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution. In practice, each state has adopted a three-branch system of government, modeled after the federal government, and consisting of three branches (although the three-branch structure is not required): executive, legislative, and judicial.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] U.S. stateA state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). [PAR] States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. [PAR] States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  [PAR] States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. [PAR] States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state.  [PAR] The Constitution grants to Congress  the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. [PAR] The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw from) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v. White, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.   [PAR] States of the United States [PAR] The 50 U.S. states (in alphabetical order), along with state flag and date each joined the union: [PAR] Governments [PAR] As each state is itself a sovereign entity, it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. [PAR] Constitutions [PAR] The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The Constitution of Alabama, for example, contains 310,296 words \u2014 more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution. In practice, each state has adopted a three-branch system of government, modeled after the federal government, and consisting of three branches (although the three-branch structure is not required): executive, legislative, and judicial.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] List of national parks of England and WalesWithin England and Wales there are thirteen areas known as national parks, each administered by its own national park authority, a special purpose local authority, the role of which as set out in the Environment Act 1995 is: to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks. and to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public. The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the National Trust. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the Sandford Principle. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.  [PAR] Legal designation [PAR] National parks are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and must be confirmed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by James Bryce but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 Kinder Scout mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 white paper on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.  [PAR] In England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals. [PAR] Origins and growth [PAR] The first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the Peak District, was designated in April 1951 under the Clement Attlee led Labour administration, eight months before the end of King George VI's reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated. The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own Act of Parliament in 1988 gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, and from this two Scottish national parks, the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the Association of National Park Authorities. [PAR] Of the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen English counties and cover 9.3% of England, with no national park in the central counties.

[PAR] The Gold Cup is the highlight of the Cheltenham festival. To win it once is an outstanding achievement. To win it more than once guarantees horse racing immortality. [PAR] Here are the 7 greatest ever Cheltenham Gold Cup horses. [PAR] 7. Easter Hero - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Easter Hero is often referred to as one of the greatest horses to never win the Grand National, where it was disappointed on three occasions, but it did twice taste victory at the Gold Cup. [PAR] In 1929 and again in 1930, Easter Hero won the Gold Cup by more than twenty lengths. Despite never winning the National, many experts think that Easter Hero was the greatest steeplechaser before Arkle came along. [PAR] 6. L'Escargot - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Though most famous for beating Red Rum in the 1975 Grand National, L'Escargot had already made his name by twice winning the Gold Cup, in 1970 and 1971. [PAR] L'Escargot's first Gold Cup victory in 1970 was notable for the fact that it started as a 33/1 outsider. Only the 100/1 winner Norton's Coin has ever won a Gold Cup at longer odds. [PAR] 5. Kauto Star - 2 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] The French-bred Kauto Star is the only horse to have regained a Gold Cup and has also the only horse to win the King George VI Chase four consecutive times. [PAR] Having won the Gold Cup as favourite in 2007, Kauto Star was beaten by his stablemate Denman in 2008. The Paul Nicholls horse bounced back to regain the Gold Cup in 2009, as he defeated Denman by 13 lengths, with a run described by Timeform as: \"Arguably the best performance in the race since Arkle.\" [PAR] 4. Cottage Rake - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Cottage Rake was failed by a vet on three separate examinations, before embarking on a jumping career in which the horse won three Cheltenham Gold Cups. [PAR] Consecutive victories in 1948,1949 and 1950 saw Cottage Rake become only the second horse to win the Gold Cup three times in a row. After his third victory, Cottage Rake completely lost form, but had already done enough to write it's name into the history books. [PAR] 3. Best Mate - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Best Mate won three consecutive Gold Cups between 2002 and 2004. It is possible that the horse and jockey Jim Culloty would have gone on to eclipse the legendary Arkle and win a fourth Gold Cup, but Best Mate pulled out of the race in 2005 having burst a blood vessel just eight days before the race. [PAR] That same year, Best Mate hit the front pages, after he suffered a heart attack and died while racing at Exeter. Best Mate's ashes were buried beside the winning post at Cheltenham, where he had enjoyed so many triumphs. [PAR] 2. Arkle - 3 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] Arkle won the Gold Cup in 1964, 1965 and 1966. Such was Arkle's dominance at the time, that it is likely that he would have gone on to win the race again, but a fractured pedal bone saw the horse put out for retirement. [PAR] At 212, Arkle's Timeform rating is still the highest ever awarded to a steeplechaser (Kauto Star is the joint third highest ever on 191). Arkle also holds the record of being the shortest priced favourite in any Gold Cup, having triumphed in 1966 at 1/10. [PAR] 1. Golden Miller - 5 Gold Cup Wins [PAR] The most successful Gold Cup horse of all time was Golden Miller, who won the race five times consecutively between 1932 and 1936. As there was no Gold Cup staged in either 1931 or 1937, it's possible that the thoroughbred could have had an even better record. [PAR] As well as having won more Gold Cups than any other horse, Golden Miller also remains the only horse to have won the Cheltenham classic and the Grand National in the",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ScrabbleScrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a gameboard which is divided into a 15\u00d715 grid of squares. The tiles must form words which, in crossword fashion, flow left to right in rows or downwards in columns. The words must be defined in a standard dictionary, or present in specified reference works (e.g., the Official Tournament and Club Word List, the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), which provide a list of officially permissible words. [PAR] The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the United States and Canada and has been sold by Hasbro's Parker Brothers division since 1999. Prior to 1999, it was sold as a Milton Bradley game. Outside the United States and Canada, Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel. The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a Scrabble set.   There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world. [PAR] Game details [PAR] The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15\u00d715 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. [PAR] In official club and tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack. [PAR] The board is marked with \"premium\" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red \"triple-word\" squares, 17 pink \"double-word\" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol; 12 dark blue \"triple-letter\" squares, and 24 light blue \"double-letter\" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL. Despite this, the original premium square color scheme is still the preferred scheme for Scrabble boards used in tournaments.  [PAR] In an English-language set, the game contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points of each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English writing; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values. [PAR] Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are 19 x square and 4 mm thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition varies the width up to 2 mm for different letters.  Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. 13 x); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner. [PAR] S is the most valuable letter in English-language Scrabble because it easily goes on the ends of words; Alfred Butts included only four instances to avoid a game that was \"too easy\". Q is considered the most problematic letter, as most words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German. J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end.  C and V may be troublesome in the endgame, since no two-letter words with them exist, save for CH in SOWPODS. [PAR] History [PAR] In 1938, American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented called Lexiko. The two games",

[PAR] Al Capone was a notorious gangster who ran an organized crime syndicate in Chicago during the 1920s, taking advantage of the era of Prohibition . Capone, who was both charming and charitable as well as powerful and vicious, became an iconic figure of the successful American gangster. [PAR] Dates: January 17, 1899 -- January 25, 1947 [PAR] Also Known As: Alphonse Capone, Scarface [PAR] Al Capone's Childhood [PAR] Al Capone was the fourth of nine children born to Gabriele and Teresina (Teresa) Capone. Although Capone's parents had emigrated from Italy, Al Capone grew up in Brooklyn, New York . [PAR] From all known accounts, Capone's childhood was a normal one. His father was a barber and his mother stayed home with the children. They were a tight-knit Italian family who were trying to succeed in their new country. [PAR] Like many immigrant families at the time, the Capone children often dropped out of school early to help earn money for the family. Al Capone stayed in school until he was 14 and then left to take a number of odd jobs. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] The St. Valentine's Day Massacre [PAR] Around the same time, Capone joined a street gang called the South Brooklyn Rippers and then later the Five Points Juniors. These were groups of teenagers who roamed the streets, protected their turf from rival gangs, and sometimes carried out petty crimes like stealing cigarettes. [PAR] Scarface [PAR] It was through the Five Points gang that Al Capone came to the attention of brutal New York mobster Frankie Yale. In 1917, 18-year-old Al Capone went to work for Yale at the Harvard Inn as a bartender and as a waiter and bouncer when needed. Capone watched and learned as Yale used violence to maintain control over his empire. [PAR] One day while working at the Harvard Inn, Capone saw a man and woman sitting at a table. After his initial advances were ignored, Capone went up to the good-looking woman and whispered in her ear, \"Honey, you have a nice ass and I mean that as a compliment.\" The man with her was her brother, Frank Gallucio. [PAR] Defending his sister's honor, Gallucio punched Capone. However, Capone didn't let it end there; he decided to fight back. Gallucio then took out a knife and slashed at Capone's face, managing to cut Capone's left cheek three times (one of which cut Capone from ear to mouth). The scars left from this attack led to Capone's nickname of \"Scarface,\" a name he personally hated. [PAR] Family Life [PAR] Not long after this attack, Al Capone met Mary (\"Mae\") Coughlin, who was pretty, blonde, middle-class, and came from a respectable Irish family. A few months after they started dating, Mae became pregnant. Al Capone and Mae got married on December 30, 1918, three weeks after their son (Albert Francis Capone, a.k.a. \"Sonny\") was born. Sonny was to remain Capone's only child. [PAR] Throughout the rest of his life, Al Capone kept his family and his business interests completely separate. Capone was a doting father and husband, taking great care in keeping his family safe, cared for, and out of the spotlight. [PAR] However, despite his love for his family, Capone did have a number of mistresses over the years. Plus, unknown to him at the time, Capone contracted syphilis from a prostitute before he met Mae. Since the symptoms of syphilis can disappear quickly, Capone had no idea that he still had the sexually transmitted disease or that it would so greatly affect his health in later years. [PAR] Capone Moves to Chicago [PAR] About 1920, Capone left the East Coast and headed to Chicago. He was looking for a fresh start working for Chicago crime boss Johnny Torrio. Unlike Yale who used violence to run his racket, Torrio was a sophisticated gentleman who preferred cooperation and negotiation to rule his crime organization. Capone",

[PAR] Fact One [PAR] Fantasia was Walt Disney's third feature film, following on from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940) [PAR] Fact Two [PAR] The Sorcerer's Apprentice, perhaps the most famous short of the film Fantasia, starred Mickey Mouse as the, er, Sorcerer's Apprentice. This role was intended as a come-back role for Disney's famous mouse, who was losing out in popularity to Donald Duck. However, also considered for the role of the apprentice was Dopey from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The animation itself was also originally going to be a one-off cartoon, but since it was more expensive to produce than regular Disney cartoons and was unlikely to make any profit, Disney decided to make it part of a collection of animated sequences with classical music accompaniments which could then be released as a feature film. That collection of animated shorts would become Fantasia. [PAR] Fact Three [PAR] The conductor of the music used in Fantasia was Leopold Stokowski. When The Sorcerer's Apprentice was being worked on, Stokowski offered to conduct the orchestra for free. He probably changed his mind when he found out he would be conducting the orchestra for the entire film. [PAR] Fact Four [PAR] Live action sequences shown between the animated segments show an orchestra playing the soundtrack. In those scenes, the orchestra were miming! The music for all sequences apart from The Sorceror's Apprentice was played by Philadelphia Orchestra. In the film, members of the orchestra pretending to play to the pre-recorded music were local musicians and employees of the film studio. [PAR] Fact Five [PAR] The original release of Fantasia featured an intermission which was announced by the film's host, Deems Taylor. The members of the orchestra are seen leaving their seats while the curtains close, both on the film and in the movie theatre showing it. After the intermission, which would have lasted for fifteen minutes, the curtains in the theatre and on the film open and the orchestra are seen to return to their seats, and then have a bit of a jam session.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Six [PAR] Fantasia, which was essentially a way for Walt Disney to show off animation and sound techniques in films, was the first commercial film to have its soundtrack recorded in stereo. It was also planned that parts of it would be shown in widescreen and other parts to be in 3-D, and, to make the film a real treat for the senses, for perfumes to be sprayed into the theatre during the Nutcracker Suite sequence.\u00c2\u00a0 [PAR] Fact Seven [PAR] Nowadays, films are completed weeks, months or even years before they get their premiere. Fantasia however was completed four hours before premiering in New York City on November 13th 1940. The final scene to be produced was flown to New York on the day of the premiere and edited into the film in time for its first showing. [PAR] Fact Eight [PAR] Despite getting generally good reviews, Fantasia was only shown in twelve movie theatres on its first release due to Disney's distribution company RKO initially deciding not to distribute it. The meant that the film could not make a profit, and meant that the budget for Disney's next film, Dumbo, was quite low. The film got a national release a couple of years later, although heavily edited (from the original 125 runtime to 81 minutes) and in mono. Again it was a commercial failure. A release in 1956 restored the stereo soundtrack, although it was only on its release in 1969 that the film finally made a profit, due to its psychedelic nature being popular with the teenage and college student audiences of the time. Its soundtrack was completely rerecorded for a 1982 release. Even the host's introductions to each segment were dubbed over. A 1990 release used the original soundtrack which had been digitally remastered, and a release for 2000 saw several of the original",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] National anthemA national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is a generally patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  [PAR] Languages [PAR] A national anthem is usually in the national or most common language of the country, whether de facto or official, there are notable exceptions. Most commonly, states with more than one national language may offer several versions of their anthem, for instance: [PAR] *The Swiss Psalm, the national anthem of Switzerland, has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages (French, German, Italian and Romansh). [PAR] *The anthem of Canada, O Canada, has official lyrics in both English and French, and is frequently sung with a mixture of stanzas in both languages, representing the country's bilingual nature. [PAR] *Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann, the anthem of the Republic of Ireland, was written in English, but an Irish translation, although never formally adopted, is now almost always sung. [PAR] *The current national anthem of South Africa is unique in that five of the country's eleven official languages are used in the same anthem (the first stanza is divided between two languages, with each of the remaining three stanzas in a different language). [PAR] *One of the two official national anthems of New Zealand, God Defend New Zealand, is now traditionally sung with the first verse in M\u0101ori (Aotearoa) and the second in English (God Defend New Zealand). The tune is the same but the words are not a direct translation of each other. Similarly, God Bless Fiji has lyrics in English and Fijian which are not translations of each other. [PAR] *There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their anthems. One of these is the Marcha Real, the anthem of Spain. In 2007 a national competition to write words was held, but no lyrics were chosen.  Other anthems with no words include Inno Nazionale della Repubblica, the anthem of San Marino, and that of Kosovo, entitled Europe. [PAR] *The national anthem of India, \"Jana Gana Mana\", has lyrics in the Bengali language, although their official language is Hindi and English. [PAR] History [PAR] National anthems rose to prominence in Europe during the 19th century, but some originated much earlier. The oldest national anthem belongs to the Netherlands and is called the Wilhelmus. It was written between 1568 and 1572 during the Dutch Revolt, but did not become the official anthem until 1932. [PAR] The Japanese anthem, Kimigayo, has the oldest lyrics, which were taken from a Heian period (794\u20131185) poem, yet it was not set to music until 1880.  [PAR] In contrast, the music of Qaumi Taranah, Pakistan's national anthem was composed in 1949, preceding its lyrics, which were written in 1952.   [PAR] The Philippine anthem Lupang Hinirang was composed in 1898 as wordless incidental music for the ceremony declaring independence from the Spanish Empire. The Spanish poem Filipinas was written the following year to serve as the anthem's lyrics; the current Tagalog version dates to 1962. [PAR] God Save the Queen, the national anthem of the United Kingdom and the royal anthem reserved for use in the presence of the Monarch in some Commonwealth Realms, was first performed in 1745 under the title God Save the King. [PAR] Spain's national anthem, the Marcha Real (The Royal March), written in 1761, was among the first to be adopted as such, in 1770. Denmark adopted the older of its two national anthems, Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast, in 1780; and La Marseillaise, the French anthem, was written in 1792 and adopted in 1795.

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry. With no reserves, Tallard's line broke and his troops began fleeing towards H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. They were joined in their flight by the Bavarians from Lutzingen. [PAR] Trapped in Blenheim, Cl\u00e9rambault's men continued the fight until 9:00 PM when over 10,000 of them surrendered. As the French fled southwest, a group of Hessian troops managed to capture Marshall Tallard, who was to spend the next seven years in captivity in England. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Aftermath & Impact: [PAR] In the fighting at Blenheim, the Allies lost 4,542 killed and 7,942 wounded, while the French and Bavarians suffered approximately 20,000 killed and wounded as well as 14,190 captured. The Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim ended the French threat to Vienna and removed the aura of invincibility that surrounded the armies of Louis XIV. The battle was a turning point in the War of Spanish Succession, ultimately leading to the Grand Alliance's victory and an end of French hegemony over Europe.",

Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are one of the most promising nanocarriers for drug delivery due to their biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and ease of functionalization. Folic acid (FA) is a vitamin that is essential for cell growth and division, and it has been shown to be effective in targeting cancer cells. In this study, we investigate the potential of FA-functionalized SNPs (SNPs\u2013FA) as a drug delivery system for cancer therapy.\n\n10: **Materials and methods:** SNPs\u2013FA were synthesized using a sol\u2013gel method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and zeta potential analysis. The cytotoxicity of SNPs\u2013FA was assessed using a cell viability assay on human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and human lung cancer cell line (A549). The in vitro drug release profile of SNPs\u2013FA loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) was also determined.\n\n11: **Results:** The results showed that SNPs\u2013FA were successfully synthesized and had an average size of 100 nm. The FTIR analysis confirmed the successful conjugation of FA onto the surface of SNPs. The zeta potential analysis showed that SNPs\u2013FA had a negative surface charge, which is important for their stability in suspension. The cell viability assay showed that SNPs\u2013FA were not toxic to MCF-7 and A549 cells at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL. The in vitro drug release profile showed that SNPs\u2013FA loaded with DOX had a sustained release profile over 72 hours.\n\n12: **Conclusion:** These findings suggest that SNPs\u2013FA have the potential to be used as a drug delivery system for cancer therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate the in vivo efficacy and safety of SNPs\u2013FA in animal models of cancer.\n\n13: ## Introduction\n\n14: Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide, with an estimated 14 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012. [1] Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, the survival rates for many types of cancer remain low. [2] One of the major challenges in cancer therapy is the development of effective drug delivery systems that can selectively target tumor cells while minimizing toxicity to normal cells. [3], [4] Nanoparticles have emerged as a promising drug delivery system for cancer therapy due to their small size, large surface area, and ability to be functionalized with targeting ligands. [5], [6] Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) are one of the most promising nanocarriers for drug delivery due to their biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and ease of functionalization. [7], [8] Folic acid (FA) is a vitamin that is essential for cell growth and division, and it has been shown to be effective in targeting cancer cells. [9], [10] FA receptors are overexpressed on the surface of many types of cancer cells, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer cells. [11]\u2013 [13] This makes FA an ideal targeting ligand for the development of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.\n\n15: In this study, we investigate the potential of FA-functionalized SNPs (SNPs\u2013FA) as a drug delivery system for cancer therapy. SNPs\u2013FA were synthesized using a sol\u2013gel method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and zeta potential analysis. The cytotoxicity of SNPs\u2013FA was assessed using a cell viability assay on human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and human lung cancer cell line (A549). The in vitro drug release profile of SNPs\u2013FA loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) was also determined.\n\n16: ## Materials and methods\n\n17: ### Materials\n\n18: Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), ammonium hydroxide (NH_4 OH), ethanol, FA, and DOX were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received.\n\n19: ### Synthesis of SNPs\u2013FA\n\n20: SNPs were synthesized using a sol\u2013gel method as previously described. [14] Briefly, 10 mL of ethanol was added to 20 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of 0.5 mL of TEOS and 0.5 mL of NH_4 OH. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then 0.1 g of CTAB was added. The mixture was then stirred for an additional 30 minutes. The resulting SNPs were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes and washed three times with deionized water. The SNPs were then dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C overnight.\n\n21: The SNPs\u2013FA were synthesized by mixing 10 mg of SNPs with 1 mg of FA in 1 mL of ethanol. The mixture was stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. The resulting SNPs\u2013FA were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes and washed three times with deionized water. The SNPs\u2013FA were then dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C overnight.\n\n22: ### Characterization of SNPs\u2013FA\n\n23: The size and morphology of the SNPs\u2013FA were characterized using TEM (JEOL JEM-2100, Tokyo, Japan).

Founded by Canadian environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace states its goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity\"  and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants.   Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  and is a founding member  of the INGO Accountability Charter; an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations. [PAR] Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world.   Greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge,    and influenced both the private and the public sector.   Greenpeace has also been a source of controversy;  its motives and methods (some of the latter being illegal) have received criticism,  including an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The organization's direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists,   such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat[http://www.biofortified.org/2013/06/gmo-crops-vandalized-in-oregon/ GMO crops vandalized in Oregon], Karl Haro von Mogel, Biology Fortified, 24 June 2013. and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site in Peru.  [PAR] History [PAR] Origins [PAR] In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000  people blocked a major U.S.\u2013Canadian border crossing in British Columbia, carrying signs reading \"Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes\".  The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb. [PAR] While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opposers were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. As members of the Sierra Club Canada, they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization. From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, \"bearing witness\", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence. Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club. The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay St. became the HQ.  As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, Greenpeace, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's \"quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance\". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.  Within half a year Greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in Kitsilano.  [PAR] Irving Stowe arranged a benefit concert (supported by Joan Baez) that took place on October 16, 1970 at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver. The concert created the financial basis for the first Greenpeace campaign.  Amchitka, the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace was",

[PAR] Warhead 2000 (proposed) [PAR] Never Say Never Again is the second James Bond theatrical film not produced by EON Productions and the second film adaptation of the story Thunderball . Released in 1983, it stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was released theatrically by Warner Bros. [PAR] The film is not considered part of the canon of the Bond film franchise from EON Productions and United Artists , despite its currently being handled by the official film series distributor, MGM. MGM acquired the distribution rights in 1997 after their acquisition of Orion Pictures. The film also marks the culmination of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory .

[PAR] The film opens with a middle-aged, yet still athletic James Bond making his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond lets his guard down, forgetting that the girl might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is stabbed to death by her. Or so it seems. [PAR] In fact, the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. [PAR] Feeling that Bond is slipping, M orders him to enroll in a health clinic in order to \"eliminate all those free radicals\" and get back into shape. While there, Bond discovers a mysterious nurse, Fatima Blush , and her patient, who is wrapped in bandages. His suspicions are aroused even further when a thug (Lippe) tries to kill him. [PAR] Blush and her charge, an American Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi , are in fact operatives of [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] , a criminal organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his retinas to match the retinal pattern of the American President. Using his position as a pilot, and the president's eye pattern to circumvent security, Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world. [PAR] M reluctantly reactivates the 00 section, and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons, beginning with a rendezvous with Domino Petachi , the pilot's sister, who is kept a virtual prisoner by her lover, Maximillian Largo . Bond pursues Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas , where he engages Domino, Fatima Blush, and Largo in a game of wits and resources as he attempts to derail [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] 's scheme.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] ScrabbleScrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a gameboard which is divided into a 15\u00d715 grid of squares. The tiles must form words which, in crossword fashion, flow left to right in rows or downwards in columns. The words must be defined in a standard dictionary, or present in specified reference works (e.g., the Official Tournament and Club Word List, the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), which provide a list of officially permissible words. [PAR] The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc. in the United States and Canada and has been sold by Hasbro's Parker Brothers division since 1999. Prior to 1999, it was sold as a Milton Bradley game. Outside the United States and Canada, Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel. The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a Scrabble set.   There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world. [PAR] Game details [PAR] The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15\u00d715 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. [PAR] In official club and tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack. [PAR] The board is marked with \"premium\" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red \"triple-word\" squares, 17 pink \"double-word\" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol; 12 dark blue \"triple-letter\" squares, and 24 light blue \"double-letter\" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL. Despite this, the original premium square color scheme is still the preferred scheme for Scrabble boards used in tournaments.  [PAR] In an English-language set, the game contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points of each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English writing; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values. [PAR] Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are 19 x square and 4 mm thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition varies the width up to 2 mm for different letters.  Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. 13 x); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner. [PAR] S is the most valuable letter in English-language Scrabble because it easily goes on the ends of words; Alfred Butts included only four instances to avoid a game that was \"too easy\". Q is considered the most problematic letter, as most words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German. J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end.  C and V may be troublesome in the endgame, since no two-letter words with them exist, save for CH in SOWPODS. [PAR] History [PAR] In 1938, American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented called Lexiko. The two games",

[PAR] In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.  [PAR] Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066\u20131154,  Plantagenet 1154\u20131485,  Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of  1649\u20131660). [PAR] Dynastically, all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional, beginning with Henry II (reigned 1154-1189) as from that time, the Angevin kings became \"more English in nature\"; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I  of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor. [PAR] The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558\u20131603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World. [PAR] From the accession of James I in 1603, the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the  execution of Charles I in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War  established  the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament, although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. [PAR] From this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom, with the reservation that it is \"uncodified\", is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689. On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.

These distinctions are made on the basis of floristic composition and distribution -- the species of plants growing in a particular desert region. Plant communities, in turn, are determined by the geologic history of a region, the soil and mineral conditions, the elevation and the patterns of precipitation. [PAR] Three of these deserts -- the Chihuahuan, the Sonoran and the Mojave -- are called \"hot deserts,\" because of their high temperatures during the long summer and because the evolutionary affinities of their plant life are largely with the subtropical plant communities to the south. The Great Basin Desert is called a \"cold desert\" because it is generally cooler and its dominant plant life is not subtropical in origin. [PAR] Chihuahuan Desert : A small area of southeastern New Mexico and extreme western Texas, extending south into a vast area of Mexico. [PAR] Great Basin Desert : The northern three-quarters of Nevada, western and southern Utah, to the southern third of Idaho and the southeastern corner of Oregon. According to some, it also includes small portions of western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming. Bordered on the south by the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts. [PAR] Mojave Desert : A portion of southern Nevada, extreme southwestern Utah and of eastern California, north of the Sonoran Desert. [PAR] Sonoran Desert : An arid region covering approximately 100,000 square miles in southwestern Arizona and southeastern California, as well as most of Baja California and the western half of the state of Sonora, Mexico. Subdivisions of this hot, dry region include the Colorado and Yuma deserts. [PAR] Desert Disagreements [PAR] This classification of North American deserts is by no means universally accepted by all biologists, geologists and other scientists. For instance, some maintain that the Mojave is not a distinct desert at all, but simply a transition zone between the Great Basin and Sonoran deserts. Even among those who agree upon this classification, there is disagreement over the exact geographic areas circumscribed by each of the four deserts. Some scientists would use animals and other criteria, as well as distribution of plant species, to determine desert different boundaries for these four deserts. [PAR] The Colorado Plateau is another major source of disagreement among scientists. This semiarid region of southern Utah and northern Arizona contains many majestic national parks, including Arches and Grand Canyon. Yet, experts cannot agree on the desert classification of this geologically distinct region. Some do not include the Colorado Plateau within any desert at all; others call this area the Painted Desert; still others, DesertUSA included, consider this region the southeastern extent of the Great Basin Desert. [PAR] Grand Canyon from North Rim [PAR] An additional source of confusion is provided by the great number of desert names (i.e. Yuman Desert, Colorado Desert, etc.) that do not match any of the four major deserts listed above. These names usually refer to local subdivisions within one of the four major deserts. These \"deserts\" are identified and defined below.

It is said that the two most well-known political parties in American are the Democrats and Republicans. Surprising to some, the two parties are represented by the symbols of a donkey and an elephant (respectively). [PAR] Initially these animal symbols were used on campaign  banners, but over the years they have become two of the most outstanding logos  in American politics allowing candidates to introduce their US political  logo designs . Let\u2019s take a look at the brief history behind these two political logos. We\u2019ll also review how these two animal symbols came to represent the two of the biggest political parties of US. [PAR] The Democratic Donkey [PAR] The Democrats were first to use the donkey as their representative symbol. The donkey represents the Democrats\u2019 beginning 1828.\u00a0 The running President of 1828 was President Andrew Jackson and he was labeled as a \u201cjackass\u201d due to his populist views and stubborn nature. His main slogan was, \u201cLet the people rule.\u201d Although the cartoon was depicted to mock him, it was later adopted by Jackson himself to represent his Democratic party in 1837. [PAR] The Republican Elephant [PAR] Some believe that being a Republican influenced Thomas Nast on choosing a bull elephant to represent his party. However, the Republican elephant was not as intentional as Jackson\u2019s donkey. It was formed through a series of events involving New York\u2019s two popular magazines, The Herald and The Harper\u2019s Weekly. The Herald once ran a story of zoo animals being let loose and roaming in New York\u2019s Central Park looking for prey. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a cartoon of a donkey wearing lion\u2019s skin, chasing away all the animals (given below). This cartoon was a metaphor for President Ulysses S. Grant whom was running for third term presidency and there was a significant amount of conflict in the Democratic Party. This was one reason that the cartoon included a panicked elephant bearing the label, \u201cRepublican Vote.\u201d \u00a0Ever since then, the elephant became the Republican Party\u2019s its main symbol.However such attacks on political campaign branding are not isolated  incidents of the past. We witness Republican  logo design goof ups today as well. [PAR] Discussion and Meaning of these Symbols [PAR] The Democratic donkey represents hard work, diligence, humbleness and a dedication to the USA. The Republicans however, strongly disagree and consider the donkey a symbol of stubbornness. [PAR] On the other hand, the Republican elephant represents intelligence, dignity and is considered as the symbol of strength (as it is seen as the only animal that stood up to a lion). In contrast to this, the Democrats see the elephant as comparable to a circus animal. [PAR] Both of these symbols found firm foundation in the growing American pop culture and were copyrighted to represent the two political parties. The political logos have the prominent standardized colors and stars of the American flag. Generally, the Republican elephant logo upholds 3 stars while the Democratic donkey logo design has 4. However, the donkey can also been seen with a variation of 3 stars. [PAR] The Man Behind the Logo Designs [PAR] Thomas Nast was a political cartoonist, who usually drew satirical cartoons depicting the state of American politics. It was his idea to use the two animals for representing the Democratic and Republican parties. Thomas Nast was born in 1840 and had a great career being a caricaturist, an illustrator and a painter. Apart from the political symbols, he is also well acclaimed for the sketch of fat and jolly Santa Claus carrying gifts for little children (previously, Santa was depicted as skinny). Although the artist died in 1902, his sketches and drawings still live on. [PAR] There you go! Wasn\u2019t that an interesting history?

(Spoiler alert: it\u2019s 3 John, and I\u2019ll explain why later.) The Bible is a pretty long book , and that might give the impression that every book of the Bible is long, too. [PAR] But good news! Not every book of the Bible is so long. It\u00a0has some tiny documents in it. In fact, the shortest books of the Bible are shorter than this blog post. [PAR] The shortest books of the Bible [PAR] Here are the five shortest books of the Bible, beginning with the very shortest. These measurements are by words in the original languages. Each of these books is only one chapter long, and would take you a few minutes to read, tops: [PAR] Jude \u00a0(461 words) [PAR] I got these word counts using Word Lists in Logos Bible Software . Again, these aren\u2019t listed by English word count: this is from the underlying Greek and Hebrew. [PAR] \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work, dude! Why not just count the verses?\u201d [PAR] Because verses vary in length, and with such brief books, it\u2019s best not to risk it. And if we were going by verse count, we\u2019d be dealing with a different ordered list. Philemon\u00a0has more verses than Obadiah (the shortest book in the Old Testament), but fewer words. Second John has fewer verses than Third John, but more words. If we were going by verse count, we\u2019d still know the shortest books of the Bible, but we\u2019d have them out of order. [PAR] Contrast that with the longest books [PAR] Here\u2019s an infographic comparing the shortest books of the Bible to the longest books of the Bible . [PAR] Read these books front-to-back [PAR] One of the best habits to form when studying the Bible is to read the entire book you\u2019re working with in one sitting.

The Bible\u2019s made up of letters and stories and oracles, but we tend to treat it more like a reference guide.\u00a0Maybe that\u2019s because the Bible\u2019s so big\u2014really, where are you going to find the time to read 150 Psalms? [PAR] Reading entire books of the Bible at once can be a tough habit to get into, but starting with some of the shortest books of the Bible\u00a0might help you get the hang of it. [PAR] And by the way, this blog post is weighing in at around 450 words, so if you can read this sort of stuff, Third John , Second John , and Philemon will be no problem at all!\u00a0 [PAR] In fact, here\u2019s a challenge: set a timer for 15 minutes and read all five of these books. Not only will you have read five books in one sitting, but you\u2019ll be able to say you read Obadiah \u2014how many people do you know who can say that?

Nokia builds bridges between people--both when they are far apart and face-to-face--and also bridges the gap between people and the information they need. [PAR] History of Nokia Corporation [PAR] Nokia Corporation is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, serving customers in 130 countries. Nokia is divided into four business groups: Mobile Phones, Multimedia, Enterprise Solutions, and Networks. The Mobile Phones group markets wireless voice and data products in consumer and corporate markets. The Multimedia segment sells mobile gaming devices, home satellite systems, and cable television set-top boxes. The Enterprise Solutions group develops wireless systems for use in the corporate sector. Wireless switching and transmission equipment is sold through the company's Networks division. Nokia operates 15 manufacturing facilities in nine countries and maintains research and development facilities in 12 countries. [PAR] 19th-Century Origins [PAR] Originally a manufacturer of pulp and paper, Nokia was founded as Nokia Company in 1865 in a small town of the same name in central Finland. Nokia was a pioneer in the industry and introduced many new production methods to a country with only one major natural resource, its vast forests. As the industry became increasingly energy-intensive, the company even constructed its own power plants. But for many years, Nokia remained an important yet static firm in a relatively forgotten corner of northern Europe. Nokia shares were first listed on the Helsinki exchange in 1915. [PAR] The first major changes in Nokia occurred several years after World War II. Despite its proximity to the Soviet Union, Finland has always remained economically connected with Scandinavian and other Western countries, and as Finnish trade expanded Nokia became a leading exporter. [PAR] During the early 1960s Nokia began to diversify in an attempt to transform the company into a regional conglomerate with interests beyond Finnish borders. Unable to initiate strong internal growth, Nokia turned its attention to acquisitions. The government, however, hoping to rationalize two underperforming basic industries, favored Nokia's expansion within the country and encouraged its eventual merger with Finnish Rubber Works, which was founded in 1898, and Finnish Cable Works, which was formed in 1912, to form Nokia Corporation. When the amalgamation was completed in 1966, Nokia was involved in several new industries, including integrated cable operations, electronics, tires, and rubber footwear, and had made its first public share offering. [PAR] In 1967 Nokia set up a division to develop design and manufacturing capabilities in data processing, industrial automation, and communications systems. The division was later expanded and made into several divisions, which then concentrated on developing information systems, including personal computers and workstations, digital communications systems, and mobile phones. Nokia also gained a strong position in modems and automatic banking systems in Scandinavia. [PAR] Oil Crisis, Corporate Changes: 1970s [PAR] Nokia continued to operate in a stable but parochial manner until 1973, when it was affected in a unique way by the oil crisis. Years of political accommodation between Finland and the Soviet Union ensured Finnish neutrality in exchange for lucrative trade agreements with the Soviets, mainly Finnish lumber products and machinery in exchange for Soviet oil. By agreement, this trade was kept strictly in balance. But when world oil prices began to rise, the market price for Soviet oil rose with it. Balanced trade began to mean greatly reduced purchasing power for Finnish companies such as Nokia. [PAR] Although the effects were not catastrophic, the oil crisis did force Nokia to reassess its reliance on Soviet trade (about 12 percent of sales) as well as its international growth strategies. Several contingency plans were drawn up, but the greatest changes came after the company appointed a new CEO, Kari Kairamo, in 1975. [PAR] Kairamo noted the obvious: Nokia was too big for Finland. The company had to expand abroad. He studied the expansion of other Scandinavian companies",

(Spoiler alert: it\u2019s 3 John, and I\u2019ll explain why later.) The Bible is a pretty long book , and that might give the impression that every book of the Bible is long, too. [PAR] But good news! Not every book of the Bible is so long. It\u00a0has some tiny documents in it. In fact, the shortest books of the Bible are shorter than this blog post. [PAR] The shortest books of the Bible [PAR] Here are the five shortest books of the Bible, beginning with the very shortest. These measurements are by words in the original languages. Each of these books is only one chapter long, and would take you a few minutes to read, tops: [PAR] Jude \u00a0(461 words) [PAR] I got these word counts using Word Lists in Logos Bible Software . Again, these aren\u2019t listed by English word count: this is from the underlying Greek and Hebrew. [PAR] \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work, dude! Why not just count the verses?\u201d [PAR] Because verses vary in length, and with such brief books, it\u2019s best not to risk it. And if we were going by verse count, we\u2019d be dealing with a different ordered list. Philemon\u00a0has more verses than Obadiah (the shortest book in the Old Testament), but fewer words. Second John has fewer verses than Third John, but more words. If we were going by verse count, we\u2019d still know the shortest books of the Bible, but we\u2019d have them out of order. [PAR] Contrast that with the longest books [PAR] Here\u2019s an infographic comparing the shortest books of the Bible to the longest books of the Bible . [PAR] Read these books front-to-back [PAR] One of the best habits to form when studying the Bible is to read the entire book you\u2019re working with in one sitting. It\u2019s certainly helped me with this project . [PAR] If you\u2019re setting out to study a book of the Bible, it\u2019s best to try reading the entire book at once.\u00a0 Andy Naselli just wrote a nice bit on this at the Desiring God blog: [PAR] Have you ever read the\u00a0 Gospel according the Matthew \u00a0straight through in one sitting? Or\u00a0 Romans ? Or\u00a0 Job ? Or\u00a0 Revelation ? If not, you\u2019re missing out.\u00a0That\u2019s the way they\u2019re meant to be read. [PAR] He\u2019s right. The Bible\u2019s made up of letters and stories and oracles, but we tend to treat it more like a reference guide.\u00a0Maybe that\u2019s because the Bible\u2019s so big\u2014really, where are you going to find the time to read 150 Psalms? [PAR] Reading entire books of the Bible at once can be a tough habit to get into, but starting with some of the shortest books of the Bible\u00a0might help you get the hang of it. [PAR] And by the way, this blog post is weighing in at around 450 words, so if you can read this sort of stuff, Third John , Second John , and Philemon will be no problem at all!\u00a0 [PAR] In fact, here\u2019s a challenge: set a timer for 15 minutes and read all five of these books. Not only will you have read five books in one sitting, but you\u2019ll be able to say you read Obadiah \u2014how many people do you know who can say that? (Probably not many \u2026 it\u2019s the least popular book of the Bible .) [PAR] Download that chart for yourself [PAR] Plug in your email address and I\u2019ll send you a copy on the infographic in this piece. You\u2019ll also be first in line to hear about more cool stuff that happens around here. =) [PAR] Email address [PAR] What about the other books of the Bible?

For the time being, they have the fairly clunky Latin and Greek numerical names ununtium (Uut), ununpentium (Uup), ununseptium (Uus), and ununoctium (Uuo), but, by IUPAC rules, their discovers now get the chance to officially name them. [PAR] Online, there\u2019s growing support to name one of these new \u201cheavy metal\u201d elements lemmium in honor of Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy (who died two days before they were announced), and another octarine after the fictional \u201ccolor of magic\u201d in the late Sir Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novels (Pratchett\u00a0died in March 2015). Whether these two petitions will come to fruition remains to be seen\u2014the final names are not likely to be announced until later in the spring\u2014but as IUPAC rules demand all new elements be named after either a mythological concept or character, a mineral, a place, a property of the element itself, or a scientist [ PDF ], it seems unlikely we\u2019ll be seeing lemmium on the walls of chemistry classes any time soon. The stories behind 20 other chemical element names are explained here.\u00a0 [PAR] 1. LITHIUM (3) [PAR] Despite being the least dense metal, lithium takes its name from the Greek word for \u201cstone,\u201d lithos, because it was discovered in a rock (as opposed to the other alkali metals potassium and sodium, which were discovered in plants and animals).\u00a0 [PAR] 2. CARBON (6) [PAR] The name carbon comes from the Latin word carbo, meaning \u201ccoal\u201d or \u201ccharcoal.\u201d A small carbo, incidentally, was a carbunculus, which is the origin of carbuncle.\u00a0 [PAR] 3. NEON (10) [PAR] Neon takes its name from neos, the Greek word for \u201cnew\u201d (it was \u201cnewly\u201d discovered in 1898). [PAR] 4. PHOSPHORUS (15) [PAR] Phosphorus literally means \u201clight-bearer\u201d or \u201clight-bringing,\u201d as the first compound of the element glowed in the dark. A century before it became the name of element 15 in the late 1600s, Phosphorus was an alternative name for the planet Venus, whose appearance in the sky was once believed to strengthen the light and heat of the Sun. [PAR] 5. VANADIUM (23) [PAR] One of the transition metals, pure vanadium is a harsh steel-grey color, but four of its oxidation states produce a rainbow of solutions, colored purple, green, blue, and yellow . Because he was so impressed with how beautiful and varied these solutions were, the Swedish chemist Nils Sefstr\u00f6m chose to name vanadium after Vanad\u00eds, an alternate name for the Norse goddess of beauty, Freya. Vanadium\u2019s next door neighbor, chromium (24), also produces a variety of colored compounds and so takes its name from the Greek word for \u201ccolor,\u201d chroma.\u00a0 [PAR] 6. COBALT (27) [PAR] Cobalt is often naturally found alongside or in minerals combined with arsenic, and when smelted, cobalt ore can emit noxious arsenic-laden fumes. Long before the poisonous qualities of minerals like these could be explained by science, copper\u00a0miners in central Europe had no better explanation than to presume these toxic effects were supernatural, and were caused by devious underground goblins called kobolds who lived inside the rock\u2014and it's from the German word kobold that cobalt gets its name.\u00a0 [PAR] 7. COPPER (29) [PAR] The chemical symbol for copper is Cu, which derives from the metal\u2019s Latin name, cuprum. In turn, cuprum is descended from Kyprios, the Ancient Greek name for the island of Cyprus, which was well known in antiquity for its production of copper.

[PAR] For administrative purposes, England outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly is divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. These counties may consist of a single district or be divided into several districts. As of April 2009, 27 of these counties are divided into districts and have a county council. Six of the counties, covering the major conurbations, are known as metropolitan counties, which do not have county councils, although some functions are organised on a county-wide basis by their districts (metropolitan boroughs) acting jointly. [PAR] All of England (including Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) is also divided into 48 ceremonial counties, which are also known as geographic counties. Most ceremonial counties correspond to a metropolitan or non-metropolitan county of the same name but often with reduced boundaries. [PAR] The current arrangement is the result of incremental reform. Many of the counties have their origins in the Middle Ages, although the larger counties of Yorkshire and Sussex lost many or all of their administrative functions centuries ago. The geographic counties which existed before the local government reforms of 1965 and 1974 are referred to as ancient counties or historic counties. From 1889 to 1974 areas with county councils were known as administrative counties, which excluded larger towns and cities known as county boroughs and included divisions of some geographic counties. From 1974 to 1996 the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, some of which were established only in 1974, corresponded directly with the ceremonial counties. [PAR] Counties, usually either historic counties or current ceremonial counties, are used as the geographical basis for a number of institutions such as police and fire services, sports clubs and other non-government organisations. [PAR] For the purpose of sorting and delivering mail, England was divided into 48 postal counties until 1996; these have been abandoned by Royal Mail in favour of postcodes. [PAR] Scope and structure [PAR] Local government [PAR] Cumbria, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Warwickshire, West Sussex and Worcestershire are non-metropolitan counties of multiple districts with a county council. In these counties most services are provided by the county council and the district councils have a more limited role. Their areas each correspond exactly to ceremonial counties. [PAR] There are six metropolitan counties which are based on the major English conurbations; and they also correspond exactly to a ceremonial county and have multiple districts, but do not have county councils. They are Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. [PAR] In these counties the district councils provide the majority of services. Similarly, Berkshire is a non-metropolitan county with no county council and multiple districts and maps directly to a ceremonial county. Bristol, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Northumberland and Rutland are ceremonial counties consisting of a non-metropolitan county of a single district, and are known as unitary authorities. [PAR] Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, East Sussex, Essex, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Somerset and Staffordshire are non-metropolitan counties with multiple districts and a county council, where one or more districts have been split off to form unitary authorities. The effect is that the corresponding ceremonial county is larger than the non-metropolitan county of the same name and the county council is responsible for providing services in only part of the county. In Cornwall, Durham, East Riding of Yorkshire, Shropshire and Wiltshire the bulk of the area is a unitary authority which shares the name of the ceremonial county and the rest of county is part of one or more other unitary authorities.

Each artifact has a unique symbol and a guardian with a distinct color. The artifacts are: Amulet of Aegis, Blade of Brilliance, Chalice of Clarity, Diadem of Dawn, Echoing Flute, Feather of the Phoenix, and Gauntlet of Giants. Each artifact is associated with a unique symbol: Shield, Sword, Cup, Crown, Flute, and Gauntlet. The guardians, each wearing a distinct color: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, and Orange, protect these artifacts.\n\nDetermine the position of the Gauntlet of Giants in the circle based on the following clues:\n\n1. The Amulet of Aegis is directly opposite the Feather of the Phoenix.\n2. The Blade of Brilliance is two positions clockwise from the Diadem of Dawn.\n3. The Chalice of Clarity is immediately clockwise to the Echoing Flute.\n4. The guardian of the Gauntlet of Giants wears Orange.\n5. The guardian of the Amulet of Aegis wears Red.\n6. The guardian of the Blade of Brilliance wears Blue.\n7. The guardian of the Diadem of Dawn wears Yellow.\n8. The guardian of the Chalice of Clarity wears Green.\n9. The guardian of the Echoing Flute wears Purple.\n10. The guardian of the Feather of the Phoenix wears Blue.\n11. The Amulet of Aegis and the Blade of Brilliance are not adjacent.\n12.

The Diadem of Dawn is not adjacent to the Feather of the Phoenix.\n15. The Gauntlet of Giants is not adjacent to the Blade of Brilliance.\n\nUsing these clues, determine the position of the Gauntlet of Giants in the circle.\n\n## Solution\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to determine the arrangement of the artifacts in a circle based on the given clues. We'll use a systematic approach, considering each clue and how it affects the arrangement.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n**Artifacts:**\n1. Amulet of Aegis\n2. Blade of Brilliance\n3. Chalice of Clarity\n4. Diadem of Dawn\n5. Echoing Flute\n6. Feather of the Phoenix\n7. Gauntlet of Giants\n\n**Symbols:** Shield, Sword, Cup, Crown, Flute, Gauntlet\n\n**Guardians' Colors:**\n- Red\n- Blue\n- Green\n- Yellow\n- Purple\n- Orange\n\n**Clues:**\n\n1. **Amulet of Aegis is directly opposite the Feather of the Phoenix.**\n   - If we place Amulet of Aegis at position 1, then the Feather of the Phoenix is at position 4 (opposite in a circle of 6).\n\n2. **The Blade of Brilliance is two positions clockwise from the Diadem of Dawn.**\n   - If Diadem of Dawn is at position X, then Blade of Brilliance is at position X+2.\n\n3. **The Chalice of Clarity is immediately clockwise to the Echoing Flute.**\n   - If Echoing Flute is at position Y, then Chalice of Clarity is at position Y+1.\n\n4. **The guardian of the Gauntlet of Giants wears Orange.**\n\n5. **The guardian of the Amulet of Aegis wears Red.**\n\n6. **The guardian of the Blade of Brilliance wears Blue.**\n\n7. **The guardian of the Diadem of Dawn wears Yellow.**\n\n8. **The guardian of the Chalice of Clarity wears Green.**\n\n9. **The guardian of the Echoing Flute wears Purple.**\n\n10. **The guardian of the Feather of the Phoenix wears Blue.**\n    - Since both the Blade of Brilliance and the Feather of the Phoenix have Blue guardians, they cannot be the same artifact.\n\n11. **The Amulet of Aegis and the Blade of Brilliance are not adjacent.**\n\n12. **The Chalice of Clarity and the Gauntlet of Giants are not adjacent.**\n\n13. **The Echoing Flute is not adjacent to the Amulet of Aegis.**\n\n14. **The Diadem of Dawn is not adjacent to the Feather of the Phoenix.**\n\n15. **The Gauntlet of Giants is not adjacent to the Blade of Brilliance.**\n\n### Arrangement:\n\n1. **Amulet of Aegis** and **Feather of the Phoenix** are at opposite positions. Let's place Amulet of Aegis at position 1, then Feather of the Phoenix is at position 4.\n\n2. **Blade of Brilliance** and **Feather of the Phoenix** both have Blue guardians. Since they cannot be the same artifact, Blade of Brilliance cannot be at position 4.\n\n3. **Blade of Brilliance** cannot be adjacent to Amulet of Aegis (position 1) and must be two positions clockwise from Diadem of Dawn. Therefore, Blade of Brilliance cannot be at positions 2 or 6. The possible positions for Blade of Brilliance are 3 and 5.\n\n4. **Diadem of Dawn** wears Yellow and cannot be adjacent to Feather of the Phoenix (position 4), so it cannot be at positions 3 or 5. It must be at position 6, making Blade of Brilliance at position 2 (2 positions clockwise from 6).\n\n5. **Echoing Flute** and **Chalice of Clarity** are consecutive. They cannot include positions 1, 2, or 6 (occupied by Amulet, Blade, and Diadem respectively). They must be at positions 3 and 5 in some order. Since Echoing Flute is not adjacent to Amulet of Aegis, Echoing Flute must be at position 5 and Chalice of Clarity at position 3.\n\n6. **Gauntlet of Giants** is the only artifact left, so it must be at position 4.

The 50 stars stand for the 50 states of the union, and the 13 stripes stand for the original 13 states. The flag\u2019s width-to-length ratio is 10 to 19. [PAR] Related Topics [PAR] Betsy Ross [PAR] After the American Revolution began, the first unofficial national flag\u2014known as the Continental Colours (or, incorrectly, as the Grand Union Flag or the Cambridge Flag)\u2014was hoisted at Prospect Hill in Charlestown (now in Somerville, Mass.) on Jan. 1, 1776; it was raised, it appears, at the behest of Gen. George Washington , whose headquarters were nearby. The flag had 13 horizontal stripes (probably of red and white or of red, white, and blue) and, in the canton, the first version of the British Union Flag ( Union Jack ). It was used at forts and on naval vessels. Another popular early flag, that of the Sons of Liberty , had the 13 stripes only. The various 18th-century \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flags had only local significance, but in the 20th century such designs were popularized by political protesters. [PAR] The first official national flag, formally approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, was the Stars and Stripes. The blue canton was to contain 13 stars, but the layout of the stars was left undefined, and several patterns are known. The designer of the flag, Congressman Francis Hopkinson , may have had a ring of stars in mind to symbolize (in the words of the flag law) \u201ca new constellation.\u201d Today that pattern is popularly known as the \u201c Betsy Ross flag,\u201d although the claims of her descendants that she made the first Stars and Stripes and that she used the ring pattern are unsubstantiated. Rows of stars (4-5-4 or 3-2-3-2-3) were common, but other variations also existed. The new Stars and Stripes formed part of the military colours carried on Sept. 11, 1777, at the Battle of the Brandywine , perhaps its first such use. [PAR] Similar Topics [PAR] flag of the Confederate States of America [PAR] The Stars and Stripes changed on May 1, 1795, when two more stars and two more stripes were added to reflect the admission to the union of Vermont (1791) and Kentucky (1792). (One such flag was the 1,260-square-foot [117-square-metre] \u201cStar-Spangled Banner,\u201d made by Mary Pickersgill, that Francis Scott Key saw at Fort McHenry in September 1814, inspiring his patriotic poem .) In 1818, after five more states had been admitted, Congress enacted legislation pertaining to a new flag, requiring that henceforth the number of stripes should remain 13, the number of stars should always match the number of states, and any new star should be added on the July 4 following a state\u2019s admission. This has been the system ever since. In all, from 1777 to 1960 (after the admission of Hawaii in 1959) there were 27 versions of the flag\u201425 involving changes in the stars only. An executive order of Oct. 29, 1912, standardized the proportions and relative sizes of the elements of the flag; in 1934 the exact shades of colour were standardized. [PAR] There is no official assignment of meaning or symbolism to the colours of the flag. However, Charles Thomson , secretary of the Continental Congress, in describing the proposed Great Seal, suggested the following symbolism: \u201cWhite signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valour, and Blue\u2026signifies vigilence, perseverence [sic] & justice.\u201d As with many other national flags, the Stars and Stripes has long been a focus of patriotic sentiment .

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for females, and this section will discuss about the 3 main types of female voices, their respective note ranges, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One point to note: There is a difference between the 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type; The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that the voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas Voice Type refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to learn how to find the full range of your voice, as well as understand more about the various voice classification criteria and learn how to determine your own voice type! [PAR] Now, the 3 main types of female voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Soprano [PAR] Let us look at each of these voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. SOPRANO [PAR] As many of us would know, the Soprano voice is the highest of the female voices, and many of us would be familiar with this voice type. I am sure many ladies out there would be envious of their Soprano friends who seem to be able to hit the high notes with such ease! [PAR] A typical Soprano vocal range would probably be from the A note below middle C (A3) to the F or G note 2 octaves above (F6 or G6), making it a range of 2 plus to 3 octaves. Of course, this is not to be taken as an exact measurement but more as a rough guideline for soprano voices, and proper breath support must be used when measuring vocal ranges during singing. [PAR] The Soprano Tessitura is also usually higher than the other female voice types, considering that the overall vocal range is the highest among the female voices. [PAR] A Soprano would also probably transition out of her chest voice around the E flat note above middle C (E4) and shift into her head voice around the F sharp note one octave above the middle C (F5). [PAR] The soprano voice usually has a bright tone, and she would usually have a strong head voice, but a relatively weaker middle voice. Sopranos are also able to sing more high notes and sustain at a high pitch better than a mezzo soprano can, and they are also most often the lead role for operas or shows. [PAR] 2. MEZZO SOPRANO [PAR] For most ladies out there, you would probably belong to this voice type as the Mezzo Soprano voice is the most common female voice type out of the 3 main types, and it lies between the higher Soprano voice and the lower Contralto voice. [PAR] The vocal range for the Mezzo Soprano voice would be likely between the G note below middle C (G3) to the C note more than 2 octaves above (C6), making it also a range of around slightly",

More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 were killed during the hysteria. [PAR] Ever since those dark days ended, the trials have become synonymous with mass hysteria and scapegoating. The following are some facts about the Salem Witch Trials: [PAR] What Were the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials were a series of witchcraft cases brought before local magistrates in a settlement called Salem which was a part of the Massachusetts Bay colony in the 17th century. [PAR] When Exactly Did the Salem Witch Trials Take Place? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials officially began in February of 1692, when the afflicted girls accused the first three victims, Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchcraft and ended in May of 1693, when the remaining victims were released from jail. [PAR] What Caused the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials was a classic example of scapegoating. Fear combined with a \u201ctrigger,\u201d a traumatic or stressful event, is what often leads to scapegoating. Fear of the Devil, and witches who did his bidding, was very real in Salem at the time. [PAR] In Massachusetts during the 17th century , people often feared that the Devil was constantly trying to find ways to infiltrate and destroy Christians and their communities. [PAR] As a devout and strongly religious community living in near isolation in the mysterious New World, the community of Salem had a heightened sense of fear of the Devil and then experienced a \u201ctrigger\u201d when Tituba, one of the accused witches, confessed that she and others were in fact witches working for the Devil. [PAR] This induced panic and hysteria and quickly sparked a massive witch hunt. The fact is, although there were many other contributing factors, Tituba\u2019s confession is the main reason why the Salem Witch Trials happened. [PAR] The Massachusetts Bay colonists had accused and convicted people of witchcraft before, starting with Margaret Jones in 1648, but nobody in the colony had ever confessed to being a witch before or ominously stated that there were other witches out there. Tituba\u2019s simple confession reinforced all of the colonist\u2019s underlying fears. [PAR] \u201cThe Witch, No. 1,\u201d lithograph by Joseph E. Baker, published by George H. Walker & Co, circa 1892 [PAR] In addition to this constant sense of fear, Salem residents were also under a great deal of stress during this period due to a number of factors. [PAR] One major factor was that in 1684, King Charles II revoked the Massachusetts Bay Colony\u2019s royal charter, a legal document granting the colonists permission to colonize the area. [PAR] The charter was revoked because the colonists had violated several of the charter\u2019s rules, which included basing laws on religious beliefs and discriminating against Anglicans. [PAR] Charles II died shortly after and James II replaced him and merged the Massachusetts Bay Colony into the Dominion of New England which instituted a royally-appointed government with many strict new laws. In 1689, after the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, the Massachusetts Bay colonists overthrew the unpopular Dominion of New England. [PAR] In 1691, the new King and Queen of England, Mary and William of Orange, issued a new, more anti-religious charter, instead of reissuing the old charter, and also combined the Massachusetts Bay Colony , Plymouth Colony and several other colonies into one. The new charter and regime basically continued the policies of the Dominion of New England. [PAR] The puritans, who had left England due to religious persecution, feared their religion was under attack again and worried they were losing control of their colony. The political instability and threat to their religion created a feeling of uneasiness and discontent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [PAR] Other factors included a recent small pox epidemic in the colony, growing rivalries between families within the colony, a constant threat of attack from nearby Native-American tribes, and a recent influx of refugees trying to escape King William\u2019s war with France in Canada and upstate New York.

Geographically located in the western part of the United States, California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, and Arizona to the southeast. California shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south and the Pacific Ocean is on the state's western coastline. The state capital is Sacramento, which is located in the northern part of the state. [PAR] What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican\u2013American War. The western portion of Alta California was organized as the State of California, which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale immigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom. [PAR] California's diverse geography ranges from the Sierra Nevada in the east to the Pacific Coast in the west, from the redwood\u2013Douglas fir forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest point (Mount Whitney) and the lowest point (Death Valley) in the contiguous United States. Earthquakes are common because of the state's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, but most are too small to be felt.  Drought has also become a notable feature.

[PAR] In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.  [PAR] Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066\u20131154,  Plantagenet 1154\u20131485,  Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of  1649\u20131660).

[PAR] The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542.

Nokia builds bridges between people--both when they are far apart and face-to-face--and also bridges the gap between people and the information they need. [PAR] History of Nokia Corporation [PAR] Nokia Corporation is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, serving customers in 130 countries. Nokia is divided into four business groups: Mobile Phones, Multimedia, Enterprise Solutions, and Networks. The Mobile Phones group markets wireless voice and data products in consumer and corporate markets. The Multimedia segment sells mobile gaming devices, home satellite systems, and cable television set-top boxes. The Enterprise Solutions group develops wireless systems for use in the corporate sector. Wireless switching and transmission equipment is sold through the company's Networks division. Nokia operates 15 manufacturing facilities in nine countries and maintains research and development facilities in 12 countries. [PAR] 19th-Century Origins [PAR] Originally a manufacturer of pulp and paper, Nokia was founded as Nokia Company in 1865 in a small town of the same name in central Finland. Nokia was a pioneer in the industry and introduced many new production methods to a country with only one major natural resource, its vast forests. As the industry became increasingly energy-intensive, the company even constructed its own power plants. But for many years, Nokia remained an important yet static firm in a relatively forgotten corner of northern Europe. Nokia shares were first listed on the Helsinki exchange in 1915. [PAR] The first major changes in Nokia occurred several years after World War II. Despite its proximity to the Soviet Union, Finland has always remained economically connected with Scandinavian and other Western countries, and as Finnish trade expanded Nokia became a leading exporter. [PAR] During the early 1960s Nokia began to diversify in an attempt to transform the company into a regional conglomerate with interests beyond Finnish borders. Unable to initiate strong internal growth, Nokia turned its attention to acquisitions. The government, however, hoping to rationalize two underperforming basic industries, favored Nokia's expansion within the country and encouraged its eventual merger with Finnish Rubber Works, which was founded in 1898, and Finnish Cable Works, which was formed in 1912, to form Nokia Corporation. When the amalgamation was completed in 1966, Nokia was involved in several new industries, including integrated cable operations, electronics, tires, and rubber footwear, and had made its first public share offering. [PAR] In 1967 Nokia set up a division to develop design and manufacturing capabilities in data processing, industrial automation, and communications systems. The division was later expanded and made into several divisions, which then concentrated on developing information systems, including personal computers and workstations, digital communications systems, and mobile phones. Nokia also gained a strong position in modems and automatic banking systems in Scandinavia. [PAR] Oil Crisis, Corporate Changes: 1970s [PAR] Nokia continued to operate in a stable but parochial manner until 1973, when it was affected in a unique way by the oil crisis. Years of political accommodation between Finland and the Soviet Union ensured Finnish neutrality in exchange for lucrative trade agreements with the Soviets, mainly Finnish lumber products and machinery in exchange for Soviet oil. By agreement, this trade was kept strictly in balance. But when world oil prices began to rise, the market price for Soviet oil rose with it. Balanced trade began to mean greatly reduced purchasing power for Finnish companies such as Nokia. [PAR] Although the effects were not catastrophic, the oil crisis did force Nokia to reassess its reliance on Soviet trade (about 12 percent of sales) as well as its international growth strategies. Several contingency plans were drawn up, but the greatest changes came after the company appointed a new CEO, Kari Kairamo, in 1975. [PAR] Kairamo noted the obvious: Nokia was too big for Finland. The company had to expand abroad. He studied the expansion of other Scandinavian companies",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Bank of EnglandThe Bank of England, formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world, after the Sveriges Riksbank, and the world's 8th oldest bank. It was established to act as the English Government's banker and is still the banker for the Government of the United Kingdom. The Bank was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until nationalised in 1946.   [PAR] In 1998, it became an independent public organisation, wholly owned by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the government, with independence in setting monetary policy.     [PAR] The Bank is one of eight banks authorised to issue banknotes in the United Kingdom, but has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. [PAR] The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has devolved responsibility for managing monetary policy. The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee \"if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances\" but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days.  The Bank's Financial Policy Committee held its first meeting in June 2011 as a macro prudential regulator to oversee regulation of the UK's financial sector. [PAR] The Bank's headquarters have been in London's main financial district, the City of London, on Threadneedle Street, since 1734. It is sometimes known by the metonym The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street or The Old Lady, a name taken from the legend of Sarah Whitehead, whose ghost is said to haunt the Bank's garden.  The busy road junction outside is known as Bank junction. [PAR] Mark Carney assumed the post of Governor of the Bank of England on 1 July 2013. He succeeded Mervyn King, who took over on 30 June 2003. Carney, a Canadian, will serve an initial five-year term rather than the typical eight, and will seek UK citizenship.  He is the first non-British citizen to hold the post. As of January 2014, the Bank also has four Deputy Governors. [PAR] History [PAR] Founding [PAR] England's crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, became the catalyst for England's rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy. No public funds were available, and the credit of William III's government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the \u00a31,200,000 (at 8% p.a.) that the government wanted. [PAR] To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes.  The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The \u00a31.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy. [PAR] As a side effect, the huge industrial effort needed, including establishing ironworks to make more nails and advances in agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new Kingdom of Great Britain \u2013 England and Scotland were formally united in 1707 \u2013 to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  [PAR] The establishment of the bank was devised by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, in 1694, to the plan which had been proposed by William Paterson three years before, but not acted upon.  He proposed a loan of \u00a31.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as The Governor and Company of the Bank of England with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The Royal Charter was granted on 27 July through the passage of the Tonnage Act 1694",

[PAR] Share this: [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] Author [PAR] 7 Fascinating Facts About the Panama Canal [PAR] URL [PAR] Google [PAR] August 15, 1914, marks the 100th anniversary of the official opening of the Panama Canal, the American-built waterway across the Isthmus of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.  The 50-mile-long passage created an important shortcut for ships; after the canal was constructed, a vessel sailing between New York and California was able to bypass the long journey around the tip of South America and trim nearly 8,000 miles from its voyage.  The canal, which uses a system of locks to lift ships 85 feet above sea level, was the largest engineering project of its time. Find out more fascinating facts about this iconic waterway, including why thousands of workers died during its construction and how it\u2019s now being modernized. [PAR] The idea for a canal across Panama dates back to the 16th century. [PAR] In 1513, Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa became the first European to discover that the Isthmus of Panama was just a slim land bridge separating the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Balboa\u2019s discovery sparked a search for a natural waterway linking the two oceans. In 1534, after no such passage across the isthmus had been found, Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, ordered a survey to determine if one could be built, but the surveyors eventually decided that construction of a ship canal was impossible. [PAR] The men behind the Suez Canal and Eiffel Tower were convicted in connection with failed effort to build a canal. [PAR] In the ensuing centuries, various nations considered developing a Panamanian canal but a serious attempt wasn\u2019t made until the 1880s. In 1881, a French company headed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, a former diplomat who developed Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal, began digging a canal across Panama. The project was plagued by poor planning, engineering problems and tropical diseases that killed thousands of workers. De Lesseps intended to build the canal at sea level, without locks, like the Suez Canal, but the excavation process proved far more difficult than anticipated. Gustave Eiffel, who designed the famous tower in Paris that bears his name, was then hired to create locks for the canal; however, the De Lesseps-led company went bankrupt in 1889. At the time, the French had sunk more than $260 million into the canal venture and excavated more than 70 million cubic yards of earth. [PAR] The canal venture\u2019s collapse caused a major scandal in France. De Lesseps and his son Charles, along with Eiffel and several other company executives, were indicted on fraud and mismanagement charges. In 1893, the men were found guilty, sentenced to prison and fined, although the sentences were overturned. After the scandal, Eiffel retired from business and devoted himself to scientific research; Ferdinand de Lesseps died in 1894. That same year, a new French company was formed to take over the assets of the bankrupt business and continue the canal; however, this second firm soon abandoned the endeavor as well. [PAR] America originally wanted to build a canal in Nicaragua, not Panama. [PAR] Throughout the 1800s, the United States, which wanted a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific for economic and military reasons, considered Nicaragua a more feasible location than Panama. However, that view shifted thanks in part to the efforts of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, a French engineer who had been involved in both of France\u2019s canal projects. In the late 1890s Bunau-Varilla began lobbying American lawmakers to buy the French canal assets in Panama, and eventually convinced a number of them that Nicaragua had dangerous volcanoes, making Panama the safer choice. [PAR] In 1902, Congress authorized the purchase of the French assets. However, the following year, when Colombia, which Panama was then a",

Geographically located in the western part of the United States, California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, and Arizona to the southeast. California shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south and the Pacific Ocean is on the state's western coastline. The state capital is Sacramento, which is located in the northern part of the state. [PAR] What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican\u2013American War. The western portion of Alta California was organized as the State of California, which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale immigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom. [PAR] California's diverse geography ranges from the Sierra Nevada in the east to the Pacific Coast in the west, from the redwood\u2013Douglas fir forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest point (Mount Whitney) and the lowest point (Death Valley) in the contiguous United States. Earthquakes are common because of the state's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, but most are too small to be felt.  Drought has also become a notable feature.  [PAR] California is regarded as a global trendsetter in both popular culture and politics, and is the birthplace of the film industry, the hippie counterculture, the Internet,  and the personal computer. The state's economy is centered on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific and technical business services; together comprising 58% of the state's economy.  Three of the world's largest 20 firms by revenue, Chevron, Apple, and McKesson, are headquartered in the state.  Although only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state.  If it were a country, California would be the 6th largest economy in the world and the 35th most populous. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word California originally referred to the entire region composed of the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico, the current U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming. [PAR] The name California is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by Black Amazons and ruled by Queen Calafia,   who fought alongside Muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a Muslim leader, the Caliph, fictionally implying that California was the Caliphate.  The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandi\u00e1n, written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo.Gudde, Erwin G. and William Bright. 2004.

Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practiced on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating  and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994. [PAR] The Winter Games have evolved since its inception. Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program. Others (such as curling and bobsleigh) have been discontinued and later reintroduced, or have been permanently discontinued (such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it). Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games. It created an income stream, via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to showcase the claimed superiority of their political systems. [PAR] The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries. The United States has hosted the Games four times (1932, 1960, 1980, 2002); France has been the host three times (1924, 1968, 1992);  Austria (1964, 1976), Canada (1988, 2010), Japan (1972, 1998), Italy (1956, 2006), Norway (1952, 1994), and Switzerland (1928, 1948) have hosted the Games twice. Germany (1936), Yugoslavia (1984), and Russia (2014) have hosted the Games once. The IOC has selected Pyeongchang, South Korea, to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing, China, to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. No country in the southern hemisphere has hosted or even been an applicant to host the Winter Olympics; the major challenge preventing one hosting the games is the dependence on winter weather, and the traditional February timing of the games falls in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer. [PAR] Twelve countries \u2013 Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States \u2013 have sent athletes to every Winter Olympic Games.

Please keep in mind these are not the official chess rules. These chess rules are intended to help our visitors and customers new to the chess game, get the chessboard setup correctly along with enough instruction and knowledge of the chess rules to have a legitimate and enjoyable game. We hope you find them useful. [PAR] Object of the Chess Game [PAR] It's rather simple, there are two players with one player having 16 black or dark color chess pieces and the other player having 16 white or light color chess pieces. The chess players move on a square chessboard made up of 64 individual squares consisting of 32 dark squares and 32 light squares. Each chess piece has a defined starting point or square with the dark chess pieces aligned on one side of the board and the light pieces on the other. There are 6 different types of chess pieces, each with it's own unique method to move on the chessboard. The chess pieces are used to both attack and defend from attack, against the other players chessmen. Each player has one chess piece called the king. The ultimate objective of the game is to capture the opponents king. Having said this, the king will never actually be captured. When either sides king is trapped to where it cannot move without being taken, it's called \"checkmate\" or the shortened version \"mate\". At this point, the game is over. The object of playing chess is really quite simple, but mastering this game of chess is a totally different story. [PAR] Chess Board Setup [PAR] Now that you have a basic concept for the object of the chess game, the next step is to get the the chessboard and chess pieces setup according to the rules of playing chess. Lets start with the chess pieces. The 16 chess pieces are made up of 1 King, 1 queen, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks, and 8 pawns. From the following diagram, you can identify the pieces and the general character of their shape and appearance and also the location or square the chess pieces start from according to the chess rules. Now the chessboard. The correct orientation, as per the chess rules, is with a black square on your left side as facing the chess board. One of the more common mistakes in setting up the chess board is reversing the king and queen chess pieces. Remember, as per the chess rules, the queen is always on her own color while the king is always on the opposite color. [PAR] How the Chess Pieces Move [PAR] Now that you have the chessboard setup with each piece sitting on its correct square, you need to know the chess rules of how each chess piece moves.\u00a0 The following are diagrams and instructions for the move of each chess piece. [PAR] Chess piece - King [PAR] Having a king is mandatory even though he's pretty much worthless and really nothing more than a mere figure-head. But that's the rule of chess, like it or not, you have to have a king. The king is always the tallest piece on the chessboard and the king chess piece will usually have a cross-like object on top.\u00a0 By the rules of chess, his moves are pretty limited, he can only move one square at a time but he can move forward,\u00a0 backward, left, right and diagonally.\u00a0 Not to offer any particular strategy, but keep him safe and well protected! [PAR] Chess piece - Queen [PAR] Unlike the king, the queen is no figure-head. She's the most powerful chess piece you have on the chessboard.\u00a0 The queen usually looks like a queen in the sense that she'll have a crown, sometimes with nice sharp points. According to the rules of playing chess, she can move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally just as many squares she wants (without jumping other chess pieces).\u00a0 So you'll want to be careful and not give her",

[PAR] Each year, the winner of The Masters is presented with the famous \"Green Jacket.\" Slipping on the green jacket is the golden moment for many winners of the tournament. But how did a green jacket come to be such a big deal? What is the story behind the venerated Green Jacket? [PAR] Origins of the Masters Green Jacket [PAR] Let's face it: If you saw someone walking around in public in a shamrock green jacket, you might wonder if that person was fashion-challenged. But the Green Jacket presented to the Masters champion is one beautiful piece of outerwear. [PAR] The tradition of the Green Jacket at Augusta National Golf Club dates to 1937. That year, members of the club wore green jackets during the tournament so that fans in attendance could easily recognize them if a fan needed to ask questions. [PAR] One of the inspirations for the idea was provided by a dinner that Augusta National co-founder Bobby Jones attended at Royal Liverpool . The English links club's captains were adorned in red jackets during that dinner, to stand out. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Greatest Quarterbacks of All Time? [PAR] Augusta National co-founder and club chairman Clifford Roberts embraced the idea of an identifying piece of clothing for club members - something that would make it easy for non-members (and tournament attendees) to recognize an Augusta member. [PAR] According to the tournament's official website, Masters.com: [PAR] \"Jackets were purchased from the Brooks Uniform Company, New York City ... Members were not initially enthusiastic about wearing the warm, green coat. Within several years, a lightweight, made-to-order Jacket was available from the Club's Golf Shop. ... The single breasted, single vent Jacket's color is 'Masters Green' and is adorned with an Augusta National Golf Club logo on the left chest pocket. The logo also appears on the brass buttons.\" [PAR] Presenting the Green Jacket to the Masters Winners [PAR] Soon after its public debut in 1937, the Green Jacket became the symbol of membership in the ultra-exclusive Augusta National Golf Club. [PAR] And winners of the Masters Tournament began, themselves, receiving green jackets at the 1949 Masters . The winners all become members of the Champions Club at Augusta. From 1937 through 1948, only Augusta National members wore the green jackets; from 1949 onward, the tournament winner also got one. [PAR] By the way, in those early years it was just as common to hear Masters players and Augusta members refer to the garment as the \"green blazer\" or \"green coat,\" as it was for them to use \"green jacket.\" [PAR] Who Was the First Masters Champ Presented with the Green Jacket?

More than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 were killed during the hysteria. [PAR] Ever since those dark days ended, the trials have become synonymous with mass hysteria and scapegoating. The following are some facts about the Salem Witch Trials: [PAR] What Were the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials were a series of witchcraft cases brought before local magistrates in a settlement called Salem which was a part of the Massachusetts Bay colony in the 17th century. [PAR] When Exactly Did the Salem Witch Trials Take Place? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials officially began in February of 1692, when the afflicted girls accused the first three victims, Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchcraft and ended in May of 1693, when the remaining victims were released from jail. [PAR] What Caused the Salem Witch Trials? [PAR] The Salem Witch Trials was a classic example of scapegoating. Fear combined with a \u201ctrigger,\u201d a traumatic or stressful event, is what often leads to scapegoating. Fear of the Devil, and witches who did his bidding, was very real in Salem at the time. [PAR] In Massachusetts during the 17th century , people often feared that the Devil was constantly trying to find ways to infiltrate and destroy Christians and their communities. [PAR] As a devout and strongly religious community living in near isolation in the mysterious New World, the community of Salem had a heightened sense of fear of the Devil and then experienced a \u201ctrigger\u201d when Tituba, one of the accused witches, confessed that she and others were in fact witches working for the Devil. [PAR] This induced panic and hysteria and quickly sparked a massive witch hunt. The fact is, although there were many other contributing factors, Tituba\u2019s confession is the main reason why the Salem Witch Trials happened. [PAR] The Massachusetts Bay colonists had accused and convicted people of witchcraft before, starting with Margaret Jones in 1648, but nobody in the colony had ever confessed to being a witch before or ominously stated that there were other witches out there. Tituba\u2019s simple confession reinforced all of the colonist\u2019s underlying fears. [PAR] \u201cThe Witch, No. 1,\u201d lithograph by Joseph E. Baker, published by George H. Walker & Co, circa 1892 [PAR] In addition to this constant sense of fear, Salem residents were also under a great deal of stress during this period due to a number of factors. [PAR] One major factor was that in 1684, King Charles II revoked the Massachusetts Bay Colony\u2019s royal charter, a legal document granting the colonists permission to colonize the area. [PAR] The charter was revoked because the colonists had violated several of the charter\u2019s rules, which included basing laws on religious beliefs and discriminating against Anglicans. [PAR] Charles II died shortly after and James II replaced him and merged the Massachusetts Bay Colony into the Dominion of New England which instituted a royally-appointed government with many strict new laws. In 1689, after the Glorious Revolution occurred in England, the Massachusetts Bay colonists overthrew the unpopular Dominion of New England. [PAR] In 1691, the new King and Queen of England, Mary and William of Orange, issued a new, more anti-religious charter, instead of reissuing the old charter, and also combined the Massachusetts Bay Colony , Plymouth Colony and several other colonies into one. The new charter and regime basically continued the policies of the Dominion of New England. [PAR] The puritans, who had left England due to religious persecution, feared their religion was under attack again and worried they were losing control of their colony. The political instability and threat to their religion created a feeling of uneasiness and discontent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [PAR] Other factors included a recent small pox epidemic in the colony, growing rivalries between families within the colony, a constant threat of attack from nearby Native-American tribes, and a recent influx of refugees trying to escape King William\u2019s war with France in Canada and upstate New York.

[PAR] Background [PAR] Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) was born in the village of Sontsovka in the Donets region of the Ukraine.\u00a0 He was a child prodigy on the order of Mozart, composing for piano at age five and writing an opera at nine.\u00a0 His first teacher was his mother, a talented pianist.\u00a0 He attended the St. Petersburg Conservatory from 1904 to 1914, winning the Anton Rubinstein prize for best student pianist when he graduated.\u00a0 He traveled widely, spending many years in London and Paris, and toured the United States five times. [PAR] In 1936, Prokofiev returned to settle permanently in the Soviet Union.\u00a0 One of his first compositions after his return was Peter and the Wolf, written in just two weeks in April of 1936 for a children's theater in Moscow.\u00a0 Prokofiev invented the story and wrote the narration himself, drawing on memories of his own childhood.\u00a0 He constructed the music as a child's introduction to the orchestra, with each character in the story represented by a different instrument or group of instruments: Peter by the strings, the bird by the flute, the duck by the oboe, the cat by the clarinet, the wolf by the horn section, and so on. [PAR] Peter and the Wolf was an immediate success and has been loved by children all over the world.\u00a0 The music is sophisticated enough to be enjoyed by adults, even through repeated hearings.\u00a0 And its moral \u0097 you can't be a hero if you don't take risks \u0097 delights children as it must have cheered the composer. [PAR] Musical Themes [PAR] Prokofiev's Original Story [PAR] Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and walked out into the big green meadow. [PAR] On a branch of a big tree sat a little bird, Peter's friend. \"All is quiet\" chirped the bird happily. [PAR] Just then a duck came waddling round. She was glad that Peter had not closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow. [PAR] Seeing the duck, the little bird flew down upon on the grass, settled next to her and shrugged his shoulders. \"What kind of bird are you if you can't fly?\" said he. To this the duck replied \"What kind of bird are you if you can't swim?\" and dived into the pond. [PAR] They argued and argued, the duck swimming in the pond and the little bird hopping along the shore. [PAR] Suddenly, something caught Peter's attention. He noticed a cat crawling through the grass. [PAR] The cat thought; \"That little bird is busy arguing, I'll just grab him. Stealthily, the cat crept towards him on her velvet paws. [PAR] \"Look out!\" shouted Peter and the bird immediately flew up into the tree, while the duck quacked angrily at the cat, from the middle of the pond. The cat walked around the tree and thought, \"Is it worth climbing up so high?\u00a0 By the time I get there the bird will have flown away.\" [PAR] Just then grandfather came out. He was upset because Peter had gone in the meadow. \"It's a dangerous place. If a wolf should come out of the forest, then what would you do?\" [PAR] But Peter paid no attention to his grandfather's words. Boys like him are not afraid of wolves. [PAR] But",

It is said that the two most well-known political parties in American are the Democrats and Republicans. Surprising to some, the two parties are represented by the symbols of a donkey and an elephant (respectively). [PAR] Initially these animal symbols were used on campaign  banners, but over the years they have become two of the most outstanding logos  in American politics allowing candidates to introduce their US political  logo designs . Let\u2019s take a look at the brief history behind these two political logos. We\u2019ll also review how these two animal symbols came to represent the two of the biggest political parties of US. [PAR] The Democratic Donkey [PAR] The Democrats were first to use the donkey as their representative symbol. The donkey represents the Democrats\u2019 beginning 1828.\u00a0 The running President of 1828 was President Andrew Jackson and he was labeled as a \u201cjackass\u201d due to his populist views and stubborn nature. His main slogan was, \u201cLet the people rule.\u201d Although the cartoon was depicted to mock him, it was later adopted by Jackson himself to represent his Democratic party in 1837. [PAR] The Republican Elephant [PAR] Some believe that being a Republican influenced Thomas Nast on choosing a bull elephant to represent his party. However, the Republican elephant was not as intentional as Jackson\u2019s donkey. It was formed through a series of events involving New York\u2019s two popular magazines, The Herald and The Harper\u2019s Weekly. The Herald once ran a story of zoo animals being let loose and roaming in New York\u2019s Central Park looking for prey. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a cartoon of a donkey wearing lion\u2019s skin, chasing away all the animals (given below). This cartoon was a metaphor for President Ulysses S. Grant whom was running for third term presidency and there was a significant amount of conflict in the Democratic Party. This was one reason that the cartoon included a panicked elephant bearing the label, \u201cRepublican Vote.\u201d \u00a0Ever since then, the elephant became the Republican Party\u2019s its main symbol.However such attacks on political campaign branding are not isolated  incidents of the past. We witness Republican  logo design goof ups today as well. [PAR] Discussion and Meaning of these Symbols [PAR] The Democratic donkey represents hard work, diligence, humbleness and a dedication to the USA. The Republicans however, strongly disagree and consider the donkey a symbol of stubbornness. [PAR] On the other hand, the Republican elephant represents intelligence, dignity and is considered as the symbol of strength (as it is seen as the only animal that stood up to a lion). In contrast to this, the Democrats see the elephant as comparable to a circus animal. [PAR] Both of these symbols found firm foundation in the growing American pop culture and were copyrighted to represent the two political parties. The political logos have the prominent standardized colors and stars of the American flag. Generally, the Republican elephant logo upholds 3 stars while the Democratic donkey logo design has 4. However, the donkey can also been seen with a variation of 3 stars. [PAR] The Man Behind the Logo Designs [PAR] Thomas Nast was a political cartoonist, who usually drew satirical cartoons depicting the state of American politics. It was his idea to use the two animals for representing the Democratic and Republican parties. Thomas Nast was born in 1840 and had a great career being a caricaturist, an illustrator and a painter. Apart from the political symbols, he is also well acclaimed for the sketch of fat and jolly Santa Claus carrying gifts for little children (previously, Santa was depicted as skinny). Although the artist died in 1902, his sketches and drawings still live on. [PAR] There you go! Wasn\u2019t that an interesting history?

On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer.. [PAR] Prime Meridian [PAR] While the equator divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres , it is the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude and the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian (near the International Date Line ) at 180 degrees longitude that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres . The Eastern Hemisphere consists of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia while the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America . Some geographers place the boundaries between the hemispheres at 20\u00b0 West and 160\u00b0 East so as to not run through Europe and Africa. Unlike the equator and the Tropic of Cancer and",

    "response": "```xml\n<document_analysis>\nThe context provided discusses the significance of the Equator, Tropic of Cancer, and Tropic of Capricorn concerning Earth's geography and the scientific principles underlying these formations. The central theme is the relationship between Earth's axial tilt and the sun's apparent path, which affects climate zones and seasonal variations. The task is to extract and synthesize information that delves into the broader implications of Earth's axial tilt and how this tilt affects the climatic conditions across different latitudes, creating a nuanced understanding of the impact on Earth's climate systems.\n\nThe document analysis here involves examining how the axial tilt of the Earth affects the intensity and distribution of sunlight across different latitudes.

[PAR] Released 4/14/2014 [PAR] Herpes Zoster in People Who Received Varicella Vaccine [PAR] Herpes zoster, also known as zoster and shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). [PAR] Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Once the illness resolves, the virus remains dormant (latent) in the dorsal root ganglia. VZV can reactive later in a person\u2019s life and cause a painful, maculopapular rash called herpes zoster. [PAR] Anyone who has had varicella or gotten varicella vaccine can develop herpes zoster. Most people typically have only one episode of herpes zoster in their lifetime. However, second and even third episodes are possible. [PAR] Clinical Features [PAR] People with herpes zoster most commonly have a rash in one or two adjacent dermatomes (localized zoster). The rash most commonly appears on the trunk along a thoracic dermatome. The rash does not usually cross the body\u2019s midline. However, approximately 20% of people have rash that overlaps adjacent dermatomes. Less commonly, the rash can be more widespread and affect three or more dermatomes. This condition is called disseminated zoster. This generally occurs only in people with compromised or suppressed immune systems. Disseminated zoster can be difficult to distinguish from varicella. [PAR] The rash is usually painful, itchy or tingly. These symptoms may precede rash onset by days to weeks. Some people may also have headache, photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), and malaise in the prodromal phase. [PAR] The rash develops into clusters of clear vesicles. New vesicles continue to form over three to five days and progressively dry and crust over. They usually heal in two to four weeks. There may be permanent pigmentation changes and scarring on the skin. [PAR] Complications [PAR] Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster. It is a persistent pain in the area where the rash once was. PHN is diagnosed in people who have pain that persists after their rash has resolved. Some define PHN as any duration of pain after the rash resolves; others define it as duration of pain for more than 30 days, or for more than 90 days after rash onset. PHN can last for weeks or months and occasionally, for many years. [PAR] A person's risk of having PHN after herpes zoster increases with age. Older adults are more likely to have PHN and to have longer lasting and more severe pain. Approximately 13% (and possibly more) of people 60 years of age and older with herpes zoster will get PHN. PHN is rare in people younger than 40 years old. Other predictors of PHN include the level of pain a person has when they have the rash and the size of their rash. [PAR] Other complications of herpes zoster include\u2014 [PAR] ophthalmic involvement with acute or chronic ocular sequelae (herpes zoster ophthalmicus); [PAR] bacterial superinfection of the lesions, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus and, less commonly, due to group A beta hemolytic streptococcus; [PAR] cranial and peripheral nerve palsies; and [PAR] visceral involvement, such as meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and acute retinal necrosis. [PAR] People with compromised or suppressed immune systems are more likely to have complications from herpes zoster. They are more likely to have severe rash that lasts longer. Also, they are at increased risk of developing disseminated herpes zoster. [PAR] \u00a0 Top of Page [PAR] Vaccination [PAR] The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends zoster vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) for people aged 60 years and older. Even people who have had herpes zoster should receive the vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. [PAR] Herpes zoster vaccine is approved by FDA for people aged 50 years and older. However, CDC does not recommend routine use of herpes zoster vaccine in people aged 50 through 59 years old. Health care providers considering the herpes zoster vaccine for certain persons aged 50 through 59 years should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their patients.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] William ShakespeareWilliam Shakespeare (;  26 April 1564 (baptised)\u00a0\u2013 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.; ; . He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.  [PAR] Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.  [PAR] Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.  His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. [PAR] Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as \"not of an age, but for all time\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 1168  [PAR] In the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular, and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world. [PAR] Life [PAR] Early life [PAR] William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.  He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26\u00a0April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23\u00a0April, Saint George's Day.  This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, because Shakespeare died on 23\u00a0April 1616.  He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.  [PAR] Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,  a free school chartered in 1553,  about a quarter-mile (400\u00a0m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,  and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.  [PAR] At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27\u00a0November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that",

The narrator of the novel is Ishmael , a sailor on the Pequod who undertakes the journey out of his affection for the sea. [PAR] Moby Dick begins with Ishmael's arrival in New Bedford as he travels toward Nantucket. He rests at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, where he meets Queequeg , a harpooner from New Zealand who will also sail on the Pequod. Although Queequeg appears dangerous, he and Ishmael must share a bed together and the narrator quickly grows fond of the somewhat uncivilized harpooner. Queequeg is actually the son of a High Chief who left New Zealand because of his desire to learn among Christians. The next day, Ishmael attends a church service and listens to a sermon by Father Mapple , a renowned preacher who delivers a sermon considering Jonah and the whale that concludes that the tale is a lesson to preacher Truth in the face of Falsehood. [PAR] On a schooner to Nantucket, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a local bumpkin who mocks Queequeg. However, when this bumpkin is swept overboard, Queequeg saves him. In Nantucket, Queequeg and Ishmael choose between three ships for a year journey, and decide upon the Pequod. The Captain of the Pequod, Peleg , is now retired, and merely owns the boat with another Quaker, Bildad . Peleg tells them of the new captain, Ahab, and immediately describes him as a grand and ungodly man. Before leaving for their voyage, Ishmael and Queequeg come across a stranger named Elijah who predicts disaster on their journey. Before leaving on the Pequod, Elijah again predicts disaster. [PAR] Ishmael and Queequeg board the Pequod, where Captain Ahab is still unseen, secluded in his own cabin. Peleg and Bildad consult with Starbuck , the first mate. He is a Quaker and a Nantucket native who is quite practical. The second mate is Stubb , a Cape Cod native with a more jovial and carefree attitude. The third is Flask , a Martha's Vineyard native with a pugnacious attitude. Melville introduces the rest of the crew, including the Indian harpooner Tashtego , the African harpooner Daggoo . [PAR] Several days into the voyage, Ahab finally appears as a man seemingly made of bronze who stands on an ivory leg fashioned from whalebone. He eventually gets into a violent argument with Stubb when the second mate makes a joke at Ahab's expense, and kicks him. This leads Stubb to dream of kicking Ahab's ivory leg off, but Flask claims that the kick from Ahab is a sign of honor. [PAR] At last, Ahab tells the crew of the Pequod to look for a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow: Moby Dick, the legendary whale that took Ahab's leg. Starbuck tells Ahab that his obsession with Moby Dick is madness, but Ahab claims that all things are masks and there is some unknown reasoning behind that mask that man must strike through. For Ahab, Moby Dick is that mask. Ahab himself seems to recognize his own madness. Starbuck begins to worry that the ship is overmatched by the mad captain and knows that he will see an impious end to Ahab. [PAR] While Queequeg and Ishmael weave a sword-mat for lashing to their boat, the Pequod soon comes upon a whale and Ahab orders his crew to their boats. Ahab orders his special crew, which Ishmael compares to \"phantoms,\" to their boats. The crew attacks a whale and Queequeg does strike it, but this is insufficient to kill it. Among the \"phantoms\" in the boat is Fedallah , a sinister Parsee. [PAR] After passing the Cape of Good Hope, the Pequod comes across the Goney (Albatross), another ship on its voyage. Ahab asks whether they have seen Moby Dick as the ships pass one another, but Ahab cannot hear his answer. The mere passing of the ships is unorthodox behavior, for ships will generally have a 'gam,",

The escape from the court changes the characters and creates a space of sexual freedom and chaos, where women take control and men learn lessons in romance. In the comedies, the forest becomes a distorted version of the court where social rules are broken, creating a sense of jovial confusion before a return to civilisation in the final act. [PAR] \u2018Gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time [PAR] carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\u2019 Act 1.1 [PAR] The forest can be defined as a 'pastoral space\u2019 that represents the opposite of urban life in the play, representing the division between the city and the country that was beginning to emerge in Shakespeare\u2019s time. The country was often seen as a place of nostalgia for a simpler time, as shown in Duke Senior\u2019s forest court that echoes tales of Robin Hood. The merry court of the forest is an inversion of the court at the beginning of the play, far from the threats of violence and cruel treatment of Duke Frederick. Danger in the forest of As You Like It is never truly life-threatening but, when considering the role of the forest in other plays such as Titus Andronicus, the possibility of violence draws a long shadow over the plot. [PAR] 'Alas, what danger will it be to us, [PAR] Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\u2019 Act 1.3 [PAR] When Rosalind and Celia decide to enter the forest, they must put on disguises as 'beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\u2019 (1.3) The threat of displaying beauty is underscored by the reputation forests had during Shakespeare\u2019s time as spaces where vagrants lived outside society, presenting a danger of sexual violence for women who wandered there alone. For wealthy women, such as Rosalind and Celia, the threat would be even more pronounced as they would be visibly affluent in a place of extreme poverty, fuelling Celia\u2019s decision to dress in 'poor and mean attire\u2019. (1.3) The forest of Arden is a place of comedy but underlying the play is a sense of unspoken danger, drawing on the role of the forest as a place of tragedy and violence that it assumes in Shakespeare\u2019s other plays.

By leaving the court she leaves behind the pressures of being a noblewoman and is able to express her desire for Orlando, albeit while dressed as a man. That Rosalind must cross-dress in order to express her desires is evidence that the forest can only allow so much freedom: the woman may take control, but only while others believe she is male. Rosalind engages with Orlando in a way that can be seen as homoerotic, creating both the sexual and gender confusion that permeates the forest. Her disguise frees her from womanhood but entraps her in masculinity, meaning she cannot marry Orlando unless she returns to presenting as female.

The state is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the United States. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Tallahassee is the state capital. [PAR] A peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida, it has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately 1350 mi, and is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. The American alligator, American crocodile, Florida panther, and manatee can be found in the Everglades National Park. [PAR] Since the first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u00a0\u2013 who named it La Florida ( \"land of flowers\") upon landing there in the Easter season, Pascua Florida \u00a0\u2013 Florida was a challenge for the European colonial powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Native Americans, and racial segregation after the American Civil War. [PAR] Today, Florida is distinctive for its large Cuban expatriate community and high population growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues. The state's economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also renown for amusement parks, orange crops, the Kennedy Space Center, and as a popular destination for retirees. [PAR] Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and Latino, and African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. Florida has attracted many writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes. It is internationally known for golf, tennis, auto racing and water sports. [PAR] History [PAR] By the 16th century, the earliest time for which there is a historical record, major Native American groups included the Apalachee (of the Florida Panhandle), the Timucua (of northern and central Florida), the Ais (of the central Atlantic coast), the Tocobaga (of the Tampa Bay area), the Calusa (of southwest Florida) and the Tequesta (of the southeastern coast). [PAR] European arrival [PAR] Florida was the first part of the continental United States to be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Ponce de Le\u00f3n spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named the region La Florida (\"land of flowers\"). The story that he was searching for the Fountain of Youth is a myth.  [PAR] \"In May 1539, Conquistador Hernando de Soto skirted the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. He described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching as high as 70 ft, with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult. Very soon, 'many smokes' appeared 'along the whole coast', billowing against the sky, when the Native ancestors of the Seminole spotted the newcomers and spread the alarm by signal fires\".  The Spanish introduced Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Spanish language, and more to Florida.  Both the Spanish and French established settlements in Florida, with varying degrees of success. In 1559, Don Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano established a settlement at present-day Pensacola, making it the first attempted settlement in Florida, but it was abandoned by 1561. [PAR] In 1565,",

[PAR] You are here: Home / Bible Q&A / Q&A Archive / What is the relationship of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam? [PAR] Bible Question: [PAR] It sounds as if Moses was the first born son according to Exodus 2:1-2, but then in Exodus 6:20 it lists Aaron and then Moses as brothers. Aaron is listed first so he would be the oldest. Where was Aaron when Moses was put in the basket by his mother? Did Moses and Aaron have the same parents? The Bible also mentions Miriam as Aaron's sister (Exodus 15:20) but why not Moses as well? Could you explain the family relationship of these three? [PAR] Bible Answer: [PAR] The three passages you refer to are presented below. [PAR] Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months. (NASB) Exodus 2:1-2 [PAR] And Amram married his father\u2019s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram\u2019s life was one hundred and thirty-seven years. (NASB) Exodus 6:20 [PAR] And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron\u2019s sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.Ex. 15:20 [PAR] First, we want to notice that the Bible does not provide any details about Aaron in the account of Moses in the basket (Exodus 2). Scripture never tries to give us all of the details because it is more interested in sending us a message. In both of the passages above, we are told that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam are the children of one father. His name was Amram. He was a Levite. [PAR] Other Proof? There are two other passages in the Old Testament that clearly tell us these three are brothers and a sister. The first passage is found in Numbers 26 and the second one is found in 1 Chronicles. [PAR] And the name of Amram\u2019s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam. (NASB) Numbers 26:59 [PAR] And the children of Amram were Aaron, Moses, and Miriam . . . (NASB) 1 Chronicles 6:3 [PAR] The first passage says that their father was named Amram and their mother was Jochebed. From Exodus 2:1 we discovered that Amram was a Levite and from Numbers 26 we discover that Jochebed was a Levite too! Together Amram and Jochebed had two sons named Aaron and Moses and one daughter named Miriam. The second passage confirms the statement of the first one. [PAR] Moses and Aaron. From both of those passages, we discover that Aaron was the older brother, since he was listed first in each geneaology. It was customary in the Old Testament to list the first born son first. This is great news. God is more concerned about the heart of a person than about their lineage. I wonder how Moses felt when God told him that he was going to let his older brother speak for him, and how Aaron felt when Moses became the leader of Israel. [PAR] Conclusion: [PAR] The answer to that first question may be found in this verse, [PAR] Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth. (NASB) Numbers 12:3 [PAR] Moses was a very humble man. I believe that Moses did not react negatively to his brother\u2019s speaking for God before Moses. What a wonderful example to us. God calls us to serve Him and not worry about the other person. Praise the Lord.

Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). [PAR] States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. [PAR] States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  [PAR] States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. [PAR] States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state.  [PAR] The Constitution grants to Congress  the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. [PAR] The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw from) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v. White, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.   [PAR] States of the United States [PAR] The 50 U.S. states (in alphabetical order), along with state flag and date each joined the union: [PAR] Governments [PAR] As each state is itself a sovereign entity, it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. [PAR] Constitutions [PAR] The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The Constitution of Alabama, for example, contains 310,296 words \u2014 more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution.

This rash of gang violence reached its bloody climax in a garage on the city\u2019s North Side on February 14, 1929, when seven men associated with the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, one of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, were shot to death by several men dressed as policemen. The St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre, as it was known, was never officially linked to Capone, but he was generally considered to have been responsible for the murders. [PAR] Google [PAR] The Rise of Scarface [PAR] From 1924 to 1930, the city of Chicago gained a widespread reputation for lawlessness and violence. Not coincidentally, this phenomenon coincided with the reign of chief crime lord Al \u201cScarface\u201d Capone, who took over from his boss Johnny Torrio in 1925. (Torrio, who was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in 1924, had \u201cretired\u201d to Brooklyn.) Prohibition , ushered in by the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920, had greatly increased the earnings of America\u2019s gangsters through bootlegging (the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol) and speakeasies (illicit drinking establishments), as well as gambling and prostitution. Capone\u2019s income from these activities was estimated at some $60 million a year; his net worth in 1927 was around $100 million. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] George \"Bugs\" Moran was on his way to the garage in Chicago at the time of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre; he missed getting killed by minutes. A few days later, he told reporters \"Only Capone kills like that.\" Reached at his Florida home for comment on the murders, Capone offered his own opinion: \"The only man who kills like that is Bugs Moran.\" [PAR] Over the years, Capone consolidated control over most of Chicago\u2019s crime rackets by ruthlessly gunning down his rivals. In 1924, authorities counted some 16 gang-related murders; this brand of continued until 1929, reaching a high of 64 murders in one year during that time. Federal authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had much less jurisdiction than they have today, and did not include Chicago\u2019s gang-related activity. [PAR] Massacre on St. Valentine\u2019s Day [PAR] Chicago\u2019s gang war reached its bloody climax in the so-called St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre of 1929. One of Capone\u2019s longtime enemies, the Irish gangster George \u201cBugs\u201d Moran, ran his bootlegging operations out of a garage on the North Side of Chicago. On February 14, seven members of Moran\u2019s operation were gunned down while standing lined up, facing the wall of the garage. Some 70 rounds of ammunition were fired. When police officers from Chicago\u2019s 36th District arrived, they found one gang member, Frank Gusenberg, barely alive. In the few minutes before he died, they pressed him to reveal what had happened, but Gusenberg wouldn\u2019t talk. [PAR] Police could find only a few eyewitnesses, but eventually concluded that gunmen dressed as police officers had entered the garage and pretended to be arresting the men. Though Moran and others immediately blamed the massacre on Capone\u2019s gang, the famous gangster himself claimed to have been at his home in Florida at the time. No one was ever brought to trial for the murders. [PAR] The Downfall of Public Enemy No. 1 [PAR] Though the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre marked the end of any significant gang opposition to Capone\u2019s rule in Chicago, it can also be said to have marked the beginning of his downfall. With his highly effective organization, his impressive income and his willingness to ruthlessly eliminate his rivals, Capone had become the country\u2019s most notorious gangster, and the newspapers dubbed him \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1.\u201d Federal authorities began investigating Capone after",

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village.

While still named the \"Swiss Confederation\" for historical reasons, modern Switzerland is a federal directorial republic consisting of 26\u00a0cantons, with Bern as the seat of the federal authorities, called '\"federal city\" (, , ).According to the Swiss constitution there is intentionally no capital ruling the Swiss Confederation, but in Bern there are governmental institutions, such as the parliament and the Federal Council. The Federal Court, however, is situated in Lausanne. The Federal Court of Criminality is in Bellinzona. The Federal Court of Administration and the Federal Court of Patents are in St Gallen. The country is situated in Western and Central Europe,There are several definitions. See Geography of Switzerland#Western or Central Europe?. and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of 41285 km2. While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global and economic centers Z\u00fcrich and Geneva. [PAR] The establishment of the Swiss Confederation is traditionally dated to 1 August 1291, which is celebrated annually as the Swiss National Day. The country has a long history of armed neutrality\u2014it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815\u2014and did not join the United Nations until 2002. Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world.  In addition to being the birthplace of the Red Cross, Switzerland is home to numerous international organizations, including the second largest UN office. On the European level, it is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association, but notably it is not part of the European Union, nor the European Economic Area. However, the country does participate in the Schengen Area and the EU's single market through a number of bilateral treaties. [PAR] Spanning the intersection of Germanic and Romance Europe, Switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are German speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy,  and Alpine symbolism.  Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz (German);Swiss Standard German spelling and pronunciation. The Swiss German name is sometimes spelled as Schwyz or Schwiiz. Schwyz is also the standard German (and international) name of one of the Swiss cantons. Suisse (French); Svizzera (Italian); and Svizra or (Romansh).The latter is the common Sursilvan pronunciation. [PAR] Switzerland is one of the most developed countries in the world, with the highest nominal wealth per adult and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product according to the IMF.   Switzerland ranks at or near the top globally in several metrics of national performance, including government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic competitiveness, and human development. Z\u00fcrich and Geneva have each been ranked among the top cities in the world in terms of quality of life, with the former ranked second globally, according to Mercer.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The English name Switzerland is a compound containing Switzer, an obsolete term for the Swiss, which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries.  The English adjective Swiss is a loan from French ', also in use since the 16th century. The name Switzer is from the Alemannic ', in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory, one of the Waldst\u00e4tten cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The name originates as an exonym, applied pars pro toto to the troops of the Confederacy. The Swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the Swabian War of 1499, used alongside the term for \"Confederates\", Eidgenossen (literally: comrades by oath)",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical noteIn music, the term note has three primary meanings: [PAR] #A sign used in musical notation to represent the relative duration and pitch of a sound (\u266a, \u266b); [PAR] #A pitched sound itself. [PAR] #A pitch class. [PAR] Notes are the \"atoms\" of much written music: discretizations of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and analysis.  [PAR] The term note can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either \"the piece 'Happy Birthday to You' begins with two notes having the same pitch\", or \"the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note\".  In the former case, one uses note to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: Key signature names and translations.) [PAR] Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class. [PAR] In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the naming convention Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si, including for instance Italy, Spain, France, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details).  [PAR] The eighth note, or octave, is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of scientific pitch notation combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440\u00a0Hz, is named a\u2032 or A4. [PAR] There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the Helmholtz pitch notation and the scientific pitch notation. [PAR] Accidentals  [PAR] Letter names are modified by the accidentals. A sharp  raises a note by a semitone or half-step, and a flat  lowers it by the same amount. In modern tuning a half step has a frequency ratio of \\sqrt[12]{2}, approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F represents F-sharp, B is B-flat. [PAR] Additional accidentals are the double-sharp , raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat , lowering it by that amount. [PAR] In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the key signature, which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the natural symbol , is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G-sharp, a local flat before a G makes it G-flat (not G natural), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat () to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp  sign on a key signature with a single sharp  indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp. [PAR] Assuming enharmonicity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B is equal to the note C. Assuming",

The tribes kept track of the seasons by giving distinctive names to each recurring full Moon. Their names were applied to the entire month in which each occurred. There was some variation in the Moon names, but in general, the same ones were current throughout the Algonquin tribes from New England to Lake Superior. European settlers followed that custom and created some of their own names. Since the lunar month is only 29 days long on the average, the full Moon dates shift from year to year. Here is the Farmers Almanac\u2019s list of the full Moon names. [PAR] \u2013 Full Wolf Moon \u2013 January Amid the cold and deep snows of midwinter, the wolf packs howled hungrily outside Indian villages. Thus, the name for January\u2019s full Moon. Sometimes it was also referred to as the Old Moon, or the Moon After Yule. Some called it the Full Snow Moon, but most tribes applied that name to the next Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Snow Moon \u2013 February Since the heaviest snow usually falls during this month, native tribes of the north and east most often called February\u2019s full Moon the Full Snow Moon. Some tribes also referred to this Moon as the Full Hunger Moon, since harsh weather conditions in their areas made hunting very difficult. [PAR] \u2013 Full Worm Moon \u2013 March As the temperature begins to warm and the ground begins to thaw, earthworm casts appear, heralding the return of the robins. The more northern tribes knew this Moon as the Full Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signaled the end of winter; or the Full Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing at night. The Full Sap Moon, marking the time of tapping maple trees, is another variation. To the settlers, it was also known as the Lenten Moon, and was considered to be the last full Moon of winter. [PAR] \u2013 Full Pink Moon \u2013 April This name came from the herb moss pink, or wild ground phlox, which is one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring. Other names for this month\u2019s celestial body include the Full Sprouting Grass Moon, the Egg Moon, and among coastal tribes the Full Fish Moon, because this was the time that the shad swam upstream to spawn. [PAR] \u2013 Full Flower Moon \u2013 May In most areas, flowers are abundant everywhere during this time. Thus, the name of this Moon. Other names include the Full Corn Planting Moon, or the Milk Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Strawberry Moon \u2013 June This name was universal to every Algonquin tribe. However, in Europe they called it the Rose Moon. Also because the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries comes each year during the month of June . . . so the full Moon that occurs during that month was christened for the strawberry! [PAR] \u2013 The Full Buck Moon \u2013 July July is normally the month when the new antlers of buck deer push out of their foreheads in coatings of velvety fur. It was also often called the Full Thunder Moon, for the reason that thunderstorms are most frequent during this time. Another name for this month\u2019s Moon was the Full Hay Moon. [PAR] \u2013 Full Sturgeon Moon \u2013 August The fishing tribes are given credit for the naming of this Moon, since sturgeon, a large fish of the Great Lakes and other major bodies of water, were most readily caught during this month.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] William ShakespeareWilliam Shakespeare (;  26 April 1564 (baptised)\u00a0\u2013 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.; ; . He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.  [PAR] Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.  [PAR] Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.  His early plays were primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights. [PAR] Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's. It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as \"not of an age, but for all time\".The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 1168  [PAR] In the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular, and are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world. [PAR] Life [PAR] Early life [PAR] William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.  He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26\u00a0April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23\u00a0April, Saint George's Day.  This date, which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, because Shakespeare died on 23\u00a0April 1616.  He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.  [PAR] Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,  a free school chartered in 1553,  about a quarter-mile (400\u00a0m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree,  and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.  [PAR] At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27\u00a0November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] National anthemA national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is a generally patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  [PAR] Languages [PAR] A national anthem is usually in the national or most common language of the country, whether de facto or official, there are notable exceptions. Most commonly, states with more than one national language may offer several versions of their anthem, for instance: [PAR] *The Swiss Psalm, the national anthem of Switzerland, has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages (French, German, Italian and Romansh). [PAR] *The anthem of Canada, O Canada, has official lyrics in both English and French, and is frequently sung with a mixture of stanzas in both languages, representing the country's bilingual nature. [PAR] *Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann, the anthem of the Republic of Ireland, was written in English, but an Irish translation, although never formally adopted, is now almost always sung. [PAR] *The current national anthem of South Africa is unique in that five of the country's eleven official languages are used in the same anthem (the first stanza is divided between two languages, with each of the remaining three stanzas in a different language). [PAR] *One of the two official national anthems of New Zealand, God Defend New Zealand, is now traditionally sung with the first verse in M\u0101ori (Aotearoa) and the second in English (God Defend New Zealand). The tune is the same but the words are not a direct translation of each other. Similarly, God Bless Fiji has lyrics in English and Fijian which are not translations of each other. [PAR] *There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their anthems. One of these is the Marcha Real, the anthem of Spain. In 2007 a national competition to write words was held, but no lyrics were chosen.  Other anthems with no words include Inno Nazionale della Repubblica, the anthem of San Marino, and that of Kosovo, entitled Europe. [PAR] *The national anthem of India, \"Jana Gana Mana\", has lyrics in the Bengali language, although their official language is Hindi and English. [PAR] History [PAR] National anthems rose to prominence in Europe during the 19th century, but some originated much earlier. The oldest national anthem belongs to the Netherlands and is called the Wilhelmus. It was written between 1568 and 1572 during the Dutch Revolt, but did not become the official anthem until 1932. [PAR] The Japanese anthem, Kimigayo, has the oldest lyrics, which were taken from a Heian period (794\u20131185) poem, yet it was not set to music until 1880.  [PAR] In contrast, the music of Qaumi Taranah, Pakistan's national anthem was composed in 1949, preceding its lyrics, which were written in 1952.   [PAR] The Philippine anthem Lupang Hinirang was composed in 1898 as wordless incidental music for the ceremony declaring independence from the Spanish Empire. The Spanish poem Filipinas was written the following year to serve as the anthem's lyrics; the current Tagalog version dates to 1962. [PAR] God Save the Queen, the national anthem of the United Kingdom and the royal anthem reserved for use in the presence of the Monarch in some Commonwealth Realms, was first performed in 1745 under the title God Save the King. [PAR] Spain's national anthem, the Marcha Real (The Royal March), written in 1761, was among the first to be adopted as such, in 1770. Denmark adopted the older of its two national anthems, Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast, in 1780; and La Marseillaise, the French anthem, was written in 1792 and adopted in 1795. Serbia became the first Eastern European nation to have a national anthem \u2013 Rise up, Serbia! \u2013 in 1804. [PAR] Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu, the national",

[PAR] Warhead 2000 (proposed) [PAR] Never Say Never Again is the second James Bond theatrical film not produced by EON Productions and the second film adaptation of the story Thunderball . Released in 1983, it stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was released theatrically by Warner Bros. [PAR] The film is not considered part of the canon of the Bond film franchise from EON Productions and United Artists , despite its currently being handled by the official film series distributor, MGM. MGM acquired the distribution rights in 1997 after their acquisition of Orion Pictures. The film also marks the culmination of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory . Its release opposite the franchise Bond film Octopussy (starring Roger Moore ) quickly led the media to dub the situation the \" Battle of the Bonds \".

[PAR] Contents [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] Plot summary [PAR] Being the second adaptation of the novel Thunderball, Never Say Never Again follows a similar plotline to the earlier film, but with some differences. [PAR] The film opens with a middle-aged, yet still athletic James Bond making his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond lets his guard down, forgetting that the girl might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is stabbed to death by her. Or so it seems. [PAR] In fact, the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. [PAR] Feeling that Bond is slipping, M orders him to enroll in a health clinic in order to \"eliminate all those free radicals\" and get back into shape. While there, Bond discovers a mysterious nurse, Fatima Blush , and her patient, who is wrapped in bandages. His suspicions are aroused even further when a thug (Lippe) tries to kill him. [PAR] Blush and her charge, an American Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi , are in fact operatives of [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] , a criminal organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his retinas to match the retinal pattern of the American President. Using his position as a pilot, and the president's eye pattern to circumvent security, Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world. [PAR] M reluctantly reactivates the 00 section, and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons, beginning with a rendezvous with Domino Petachi , the pilot's sister, who is kept a virtual prisoner by her lover, Maximillian Largo . Bond pursues Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas , where he engages Domino, Fatima Blush, and Largo in a game of wits and resources as he attempts to derail [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] 's scheme.

The usual meaning is 25 sheets of the same size and quality:  of a ream of 500 sheets. Quires of 25 sheets are often used for machine-made paper, while quires of 24 sheets are often used for handmade or specialised paper of 480-sheet reams. (As an old UK and US measure, in some sources, a quire was originally 24 sheets. ) Quires of 15, 18 or 20 sheets have also been used, depending on the type of paper.  [PAR] Nomenclature [PAR] The current word \"quire\" derives from OE \"quair\" or \"guaer\", from OF \"quayer\", \"cayer\", (cf. modern Fr. cahier), from L. quaternum, \"by fours\", \"fourfold\". Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the association of \"quaire\" with \"four\" was quickly lost. [PAR] History [PAR] In the Middle Ages, a quire (also called a \"gathering\") was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of vellum or parchment, i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term \"quaternion\" (or sometimes quaternum) designates such a quire. A quire made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a \"bifolium\" (plural \"bifolia\"); a \"binion\" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a \"quinion\" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian term for quire, quinterno di carta. [PAR] Formerly, when paper was packed at the paper mill, the top and bottom quires were made up of slightly damaged sheets (\"outsides\") to protect the good quires (\"insides\"). These outside quires were known as \"cassie quires\" (from Fr. cass\u00e9e, \"broken\"), or \"cording quires\" and had only 20 sheets to the quire.  The printer William Caslon in a book published in 1770 mentions both 24- and 25-sheet quires; he also details printer's wastage, and the sorting and recycling of damaged cassie quires.  An 1826 French manual on typography complained that cording quires (usually containing some salvageable paper) from the Netherlands barely contained a single good sheet.

[PAR] James Beck in Dad's Army\u00a0Photo: Rex [PAR] By Neil Clark [PAR] 7:00AM BST 06 Aug 2013 [PAR] On 6 August 1973, James Beck, who played the Cockney spiv Private Walker in Dad\u2019s Army, died at the age of 44. Ironically, he was the first member of the predominantly elderly ensemble to die. A highly accomplished actor, it seemed that he was set for a successful career as a character player. However, an addiction to alcohol cost him his life. [PAR] James \u201cJimmy\u201d Beck was born in Islington in 1929, the son of a tram driver. He left home at 17 and, after National Service, he pursued a career in the theatre, eventually winning a contract with the York Theatre Company. His breakthrough came in 1968, when he was cast as Private Joe Walker in a new BBC sitcom about the Home Guard. Jimmy Perry, who created Dad\u2019s Army with co-writer David Croft, originally planned the role for himself, but was persuaded against performing in his own show. [PAR] \u201cMichael Mills, the head of BBC Comedy said to me: \u2018Dear boy, you\u2019ve got to decide which end of the camera you want to be on\u2019,\u201d Perry recalls. \u201cDavid Croft wisely said that if you\u2019re going to write and perform in it too it might create a difficult atmosphere with the rest of the cast. David had worked with Jimmy before and thought he\u2019d be right for the part. I didn\u2019t know him from a bar of soap.\u201d [PAR] The casting of Beck, like the other casting choices in Dad\u2019s Army, proved to be inspired. \u201cHe was very good,\u201d says Perry. \u201cHe had the right mix of cheekiness and charm. He gave the role a bit of oomph.\u201d [PAR] Everyone loved Jimmy Beck. \u201cHe was a nice person to get along with \u2013 one enjoyed his company,\u201d recalls Frank Williams who played the Vicar.

Dad\u2019s Army was becoming increasingly popular and he had won the lead role in an ITV sitcom called Romany Jones. He had also recently co-starred with Arthur Lowe (Dad\u2019s Army\u2019s Captain Mainwaring) in the pilot of a new BBC sitcom, Bunclarke With an E, based on adapted scripts from Hancock\u2019s Half Hour. In August, he was due to appear in a TV play called The Village Concert. [PAR] The last time his Dad\u2019s Army co-stars saw him alive was on Friday 13th July at the Playhouse Theatre in London where he recorded two radio episodes of Dad\u2019s Army (which ran alongside the TV series). The following afternoon Beck was opening a school f\u00eate when [PAR] he suddenly became ill and had to be taken home by his wife Kay. He was then rushed to hospital where he lost consciousness. He died three weeks later, due to a combination of heart failure, renal failure and pancreatitis.

[PAR] A Plantagenet primer on the last English king to die in battle. [PAR] Although he only ruled for two years \u2013 from 1483 to 1485 \u2013 Richard III stands out among his peers as one of the most famous (or infamous) Kings of England. But who was he? And why does he continue to inspire such interest? [PAR] Richard was born in Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire on 2 October 1452 \u2013 about 30 miles (50km) from Leicester and only about 40 miles (65km - two days\u2019 ride) from Bosworth where he met his end a third of a century later. Richard and his older brother Edward were the great-great-grandchildren of Edward III, a line of descent which was used to justify the claim to the throne by the House of York during the Wars of the Roses (the House of Lancaster was also descended from Edward III, via a different route). [PAR] The Princes in the Tower [PAR] The Princes in the Tower [PAR] The Two Princes Edward and Richard in the Tower, 1483 by Sir John Everett Millais, 1878. [PAR] Edward ruled as King Edward IV from 1461 until 1470 and again from 1471 until his death in 1483, when his 12-year-old son succeeded as Edward V, with Richard named Lord Protector. Young Edward and his brother moved into the Tower of London (which was then a royal palace, not a prison) but in June their parents\u2019 marriage was declared invalid, making the princes illegitimate and hence their uncle became the heir apparent. Richard lost no time in being crowned King Richard III and the two boys were not seen again. [PAR] Thus began the legend of \u2018the Princes in the Tower\u2019 and a long-standing popular belief that Richard had his nephews murdered in order to remove any competing claim to the throne. This has been widely debated for many years, with passionate arguments made both for and against Richard. [PAR] Death and disappearance [PAR] After defeating an unsuccessful rebellion in October 1483, Richard led his army to Bosworth in Leicestershire two years later to face Henry Tudor (whose somewhat tenuous claim to the throne was also through descent from Edward III). On 22 August 1485, Richard was killed at Bosworth Field, the last English King to die in battle, thereby bringing to an end both the Plantagenet dynasty and the Wars of the Roses. Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII. [PAR] Richard\u2019s body was brought back to Leicester, publicly displayed and then given for burial to a group of Franciscan friars. An alabaster tomb monument was constructed over the grave in 1495, paid for by the new King. With the dissolution of the monasteries (by Henry Tudor\u2019s son, Henry VIII) that friary disappeared and along with it any clear record of Richard\u2019s grave. Stories and rumours about where Richard\u2019s mortal remains lie \u2013 or what happened to them \u2013 have circulated over the ensuing centuries, but most of these have subsequently been shown to be tall tales.

[PAR] History, they say, is written by the victors. Tudor writers and artists had no qualms about depicting Richard III as an evil tyrant and child-murderer, as well as a crippled hunchback. Shakespeare\u2019s eponymous play, written 106 years after Richard\u2019s death, cemented the King\u2019s bad reputation (and appearance) among the general public for centuries, although scholars including Francis Bacon and Horace Walpole sought to re-evaluate his reign.

It is said that the two most well-known political parties in American are the Democrats and Republicans. Surprising to some, the two parties are represented by the symbols of a donkey and an elephant (respectively). [PAR] Initially these animal symbols were used on campaign  banners, but over the years they have become two of the most outstanding logos  in American politics allowing candidates to introduce their US political  logo designs . Let\u2019s take a look at the brief history behind these two political logos. We\u2019ll also review how these two animal symbols came to represent the two of the biggest political parties of US. [PAR] The Democratic Donkey [PAR] The Democrats were first to use the donkey as their representative symbol. The donkey represents the Democrats\u2019 beginning 1828.\u00a0 The running President of 1828 was President Andrew Jackson and he was labeled as a \u201cjackass\u201d due to his populist views and stubborn nature. His main slogan was, \u201cLet the people rule.\u201d Although the cartoon was depicted to mock him, it was later adopted by Jackson himself to represent his Democratic party in 1837. [PAR] The Republican Elephant [PAR] Some believe that being a Republican influenced Thomas Nast on choosing a bull elephant to represent his party. However, the Republican elephant was not as intentional as Jackson\u2019s donkey. It was formed through a series of events involving New York\u2019s two popular magazines, The Herald and The Harper\u2019s Weekly. The Herald once ran a story of zoo animals being let loose and roaming in New York\u2019s Central Park looking for prey. Cartoonist Thomas Nast drew a cartoon of a donkey wearing lion\u2019s skin, chasing away all the animals (given below). This cartoon was a metaphor for President Ulysses S. Grant whom was running for third term presidency and there was a significant amount of conflict in the Democratic Party. This was one reason that the cartoon included a panicked elephant bearing the label, \u201cRepublican Vote.\u201d \u00a0Ever since then, the elephant became the Republican Party\u2019s its main symbol.However such attacks on political campaign branding are not isolated  incidents of the past. We witness Republican  logo design goof ups today as well. [PAR] Discussion and Meaning of these Symbols [PAR] The Democratic donkey represents hard work, diligence, humbleness and a dedication to the USA. The Republicans however, strongly disagree and consider the donkey a symbol of stubbornness. [PAR] On the other hand, the Republican elephant represents intelligence, dignity and is considered as the symbol of strength (as it is seen as the only animal that stood up to a lion). In contrast to this, the Democrats see the elephant as comparable to a circus animal. [PAR] Both of these symbols found firm foundation in the growing American pop culture and were copyrighted to represent the two political parties. The political logos have the prominent standardized colors and stars of the American flag. Generally, the Republican elephant logo upholds 3 stars while the Democratic donkey logo design has 4. However, the donkey can also been seen with a variation of 3 stars. [PAR] The Man Behind the Logo Designs [PAR] Thomas Nast was a political cartoonist, who usually drew satirical cartoons depicting the state of American politics. It was his idea to use the two animals for representing the Democratic and Republican parties. Thomas Nast was born in 1840 and had a great career being a caricaturist, an illustrator and a painter. Apart from the political symbols, he is also well acclaimed for the sketch of fat and jolly Santa Claus carrying gifts for little children (previously, Santa was depicted as skinny). Although the artist died in 1902, his sketches and drawings still live on. [PAR] There you go! Wasn\u2019t that an interesting history? Let us know what you think of the Republican and Democratic logos",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Marilyn MonroeMarilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926\u00a0\u2013 August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult. Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928. The identity",

Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the United States. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is the eighth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Tallahassee is the state capital. [PAR] A peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida, it has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, approximately 1350 mi, and is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the state is at or near sea level and is characterized by sedimentary soil. The climate varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south. The American alligator, American crocodile, Florida panther, and manatee can be found in the Everglades National Park. [PAR] Since the first European contact was made in 1513 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u00a0\u2013 who named it La Florida ( \"land of flowers\") upon landing there in the Easter season, Pascua Florida \u00a0\u2013 Florida was a challenge for the European colonial powers before it gained statehood in the United States in 1845. It was a principal location of the Seminole Wars against the Native Americans, and racial segregation after the American Civil War. [PAR] Today, Florida is distinctive for its large Cuban expatriate community and high population growth, as well as for its increasing environmental issues. The state's economy relies mainly on tourism, agriculture, and transportation, which developed in the late 19th century. Florida is also renown for amusement parks, orange crops, the Kennedy Space Center, and as a popular destination for retirees. [PAR] Florida culture is a reflection of influences and multiple inheritance; Native American, European American, Hispanic and Latino, and African American heritages can be found in the architecture and cuisine. Florida has attracted many writers such as Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ernest Hemingway and Tennessee Williams, and continues to attract celebrities and athletes.

[PAR] European arrival [PAR] Florida was the first part of the continental United States to be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with the Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Ponce de Le\u00f3n spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named the region La Florida (\"land of flowers\"). The story that he was searching for the Fountain of Youth is a myth.

He described seeing a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching as high as 70 ft, with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult. Very soon, 'many smokes' appeared 'along the whole coast', billowing against the sky, when the Native ancestors of the Seminole spotted the newcomers and spread the alarm by signal fires\".  The Spanish introduced Christianity, cattle, horses, sheep, the Spanish language, and more to Florida.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)The Speaker of the House of Commons is the presiding officer of the House of Commons, the United Kingdom's lower chamber of Parliament. The office is currently held by John Bercow, who was initially elected on 22 June 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin. He was returned as an MP in the 2010 general election and was re-elected as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2010. He was again returned as an MP in the 2015 general election and was re-elected, unopposed, as Speaker when the House sat at the start of the new Parliament on 18 May 2015.  [PAR] The Speaker presides over the House's debates, determining which members may speak. The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House. Unlike presiding officers of legislatures in many other countries, the Speaker remains strictly non-partisan, and renounces all affiliation with his or her former political party when taking office as well as when leaving the office. The Speaker does not take part in debate or vote (except to break ties; and even then, the convention is that the speaker casts the tie-breaking vote according to Speaker Denison's rule). Aside from duties relating to presiding over the House, the Speaker also performs administrative and procedural functions, and remains a constituency Member of Parliament (MP). The Speaker has the right and obligation to reside in Speaker's House at the Palace of Westminster.  [PAR] History [PAR] The office of Speaker is almost as old as Parliament itself. The earliest year for which a presiding officer has been identified is 1258, when Peter de Montfort presided over the Parliament held in Oxford. Early presiding officers were known by the title parlour or prolocutor. The continuous history of the office of Speaker is held to date from 1376  when Sir Peter de la Mare spoke for the commons in the \"Good Parliament\" as they joined leading magnates in purging the chief ministers of the Crown and the most unpopular members of the king's household. Edward III was frail and in seclusion, his prestigious eldest son, Edward the Black Prince, terminally ill. It was left to the next son, a furious John of Gaunt, to fight back. He arrested De la Mare and disgraced other leading critics. In the next, \"Bad Parliament\", in 1377, a cowed Commons put forward Gaunt's steward, Thomas Hungerford, as their spokesman in retracting their predecessors' misdoings of the previous year. Gaunt evidently wanted a 'mirror-image' as his form of counter-coup and this notion, born in crisis, of one 'speaker', who quickly also became 'chairman' and organiser of the Commons' business, was recognised as valuable and took immediate root after 1376-7. [PAR] On 6 October 1399, Sir John Cheyne of Beckford (Gloucester) was elected speaker. The powerful Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Arundel, is said to have voiced his fears of Cheyne's reputation as a critic of the Church. Eight days later, Cheyne resigned on grounds of ill-health, although he remained in favour with the king and active in public life for a further 14 years. [PAR] Although the officer was elected by the Commons at the start of each Parliament, with at least one contested election known, in 1420 (Roger Hunt prevailing by a majority of just four votes), in practice the Crown was usually able to get whom it wanted, indicating that the famous 'defence of the Commons' privilege' should not be seen in isolation as the principal thread in the office's evolution. Whilst the idea of giving this spokesman personal immunity from recrimination as only being the voice of the whole body was quickly adopted and did enhance the Commons' role, the Crown found it useful to have one person with the authority to select and lead the lower house's business and responses to the Crown's agenda, much more often than not in the way the Crown wanted.

It is useful when the independent variables are correlated. It also works well when the number of independent variables is larger than the number of observations.\n\nRidge regression can be expressed as follows:\n\n![Ridge Regression](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Markus-Walter/publication/274078321/figure/fig1/AS:669383724667136@1536621658346/Formula-for-ridge-regression.png)\n\n![Ridge Regression](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e8f5d1a7dd1a5c1a5e6b3f2a7a5e5d4f5e5f5e5)\n\nThe L2 regularization term is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient values. The larger the magnitude, the larger the penalty.\n\nThe parameter lambda is a tuning parameter that determines the strength of the regularization. If lambda = 0, the model is linear regression. If lambda is very large, all coefficients are shrunk to zero and the result is a null model.\n\nThe lambda value is determined using cross-validation.\n\n## Ridge Prediction\n\nRidge regression can be used to make predictions for continuous dependent variables. Ridge prediction is an extension of ridge regression that can be used to make predictions for categorical dependent variables. It is useful when the independent variables are correlated or when the number of independent variables is larger than the number of observations.\n\nRidge prediction can be expressed as follows:\n\n![Ridge Prediction](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2e8f5d1a7dd1a5c1a5e6b3f2a7a5e5d4f5e5f5e5)\n\nThe L2 regularization term is the same as in ridge regression. The lambda value is the same as in ridge regression and is determined using cross-validation.\n\nRidge prediction is useful for making predictions for categorical dependent variables when the independent variables are correlated or when the number of independent variables is larger than the number of observations. It can be used to make predictions for binary, nominal, and ordinal dependent variables.\n\n## References\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression\n- https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Formula-for-ridge-regression_fig1_274078321\n- https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/ridge-regression/\n<|file_sep|>import numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Load data\ndata = np.loadtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',')\n\n# Split data into features and target\nX = data[:, :-1]\ny = data[:, -1]\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Scale the data\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\n# Fit ridge regression model\nridge = RidgeCV(alphas=np.logspace(-6, 6, 13), cv=5)\nridge.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on test set\ny_pred = ridge.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate model performance\nmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\nprint('Mean Squared Error:', mse)\n<|repo_name|>suyashgupta99/Ridge-Prediction<|file_sep|>/ridge_prediction.py\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifierCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Load data\ndata = np.loadtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',')\n\n# Split data into features and target\nX = data[:, :-1]\ny = data[:, -1]\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Scale the data\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\n# Fit ridge prediction model\nridge = RidgeClassifierCV(alphas=np.logspace(-6, 6, 13), cv=5)\nridge.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on test set\ny_pred = ridge.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate model performance\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint('Accuracy:', accuracy)\n<|file_sep|>#!/usr/bin/env python\n# coding: utf-8\n\n# # Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree\n# ## Model Evaluation & Validation\n# ## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices\n# \n# Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree!

[PAR] In the book Who Censored Roger Rabbit, she was an amoral upcoming star and former comic strip character, over whom her estranged husband, fellow comic strip star Roger Rabbit, obsessed. In the film, she is re-imagined as a sultry but moral cartoon actress and singer at a Los Angeles supper club called the Ink and Paint Club . [PAR] Contents [PAR] Background [PAR] Physical Description [PAR] Jessica is a tall, voluptuous woman with a curvy and slender hourglass figure with a narrow waist, huge and broad hips. She has fair skin and long, luxurious red hair with sidebangs that usually cover her right eye. Her green eyes are heavy-lidded and seductive with long dark lashes and accented by shimmering lavender eyeshadow. Her nose is fairly small, especially in relation to her full, red pouting lips. Her ensemble consists of a red sequined strapless dress that reveals a lot of cleavage with a low back, sweetheart neckline, and high thigh slit. In addition, she wears matching red stilettos, elegant purple opera gloves, and gold stud earrings. [PAR] Personality [PAR] She attests to Eddie Valiant that \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.\" Indeed, she proves herself to be selfless and compassionate throughout the movie. Although she seems cool and distant, she has a soft spot for Roger, whom she married because he \"makes her laugh\", is a better lover than a driver and that he's magnificent and \"better than Goofy \". She calls him her \"honey bunny\" and \"darling\". She adores him beyond measure and is irrefutably loyal to him. As proof of her love, she tells Eddie that she'll pay any price for Roger and helps prove Roger innocent by assisting with the investigation. [PAR] She makes it clear that despite what others think of her, she only has eyes for Roger and would do anything for his sake. She proves to be brave, quick-witted and intuitive; she knowingly puts herself at risk to save Roger and Eddie. Yet despite the danger, she maintains a calm composure and exhibits great skill in combat, including handling a gun. While she maintains a calm and collected demeanor for the most part, the first time she loses her composure is when Judge Doom shows her and Valiant his deadly DIP and machine to destroy Toontown, and when she and her husband are almost sprayed by the deadly substance, she sighs in relief but feels she might faint. [PAR] Appearances [PAR] Who Framed Roger Rabbit [PAR] Jessica is first seen from behind the stage curtains at the Ink and Paint Club, singing \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" After her show, followed by Eddie, Marvin Acme , owner of Toontown and founder of the Acme Corporation , enters her dressing room and informs her that she absolutely, truly, and honestly murdered the audience one night, and he means it. [PAR] He says that she was superb while Eddie peers through the keyhole to see what's going on, but Eddie is tossed out into a pile of trash by Bongo , the tuxedoed gorilla bouncer. When Eddie hears Jessica and Marvin talking through a nearby window, he climbs upon a box and peers through a gap in the curtains. [PAR] Marvin insists that Jessica to play patty cake with him on her bed, but she states that she has a headache. Marvin says that she promised, and convinces her to do it, so she agrees, but tells him to take off his hand buzzer. While they play patty cake, Eddie pulls out his camera and takes several pictures by order of R.K. Maroon , owner of Maroon Cartoons . [PAR] Later, after Roger crashes through the studio office window, leaving a rabbit-shaped hole in the glass and blinds, and walks across the road at the Acme factory, crying, he pulls out his wallet to look at photos of him and Jessica on their wedding day, their honeymoon on a beach, and them hugging",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] David CameronDavid William Donald Cameron (; born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016. He was the Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016, and has been Member of Parliament for Witney since 2001. Cameron identifies as a One-Nation Conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies. [PAR] Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare.  It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage. [PAR] Internationally, his government militarily intervened in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured a majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as Prime Minister leading a Conservative government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he chose to resign to make way for a new Prime Minister and was succeeded by Theresa May.  [PAR] Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for reining in the United Kingdom's national debt. Conversely, he has been criticised by figures on both the left and right, and has been accused of political opportunism and social elitism. Cameron appeared on the Forbes List of The World's Most Powerful People from 2010.  [PAR] Family [PAR] Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron (1932\u20132010), a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur,  Mount (born 1934), a retired Justice of the Peace and a daughter of Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet.  Cameron's parents were married on 20 October 1962. The journalist Toby Young has described Cameron's background as being \"upper-upper-middle class\".  [PAR] Cameron was born in Marylebone, London,  and raised in Peasemore, Berkshire.  He has a brother, Alexander Cameron, QC (born 1963), a barrister,  and two sisters, Tania Rachel (born 1965) and Clare Louise (born 1971).  [PAR] His father, Ian, was born at Blairmore House near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and died near Toulon, France, on 8 September 2010;  Ian was born with both legs deformed and underwent repeated operations to correct them. Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,  who had made a fortune in the grain trade in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.  [PAR] Cameron has said, \"On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so Welsh. I'm a real mixture of Scottish, Welsh, and English.\"  He has also referenced the German Jewish ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the Yiddish author Elia Levita.   [PAR] Education [PAR] From the age of seven, Cameron was educated at two independent schools: at Heatherdown School in Winkfield (near Ascot) in Berkshire, which counts Prince Andrew and Prince Edward among its old boys. Owing to good grades, Cameron entered its top academic class almost two years early.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] GreenpeaceGreenpeace is a non-governmental  environmental  organization with offices in over 40 countries and with an international coordinating body in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Founded by Canadian environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace states its goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity\"  and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals. The global organization does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants.   Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  and is a founding member  of the INGO Accountability Charter; an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations. [PAR] Greenpeace is known for its direct actions and has been described as the most visible environmental organization in the world.   Greenpeace has raised environmental issues to public knowledge,    and influenced both the private and the public sector.   Greenpeace has also been a source of controversy;  its motives and methods (some of the latter being illegal) have received criticism,  including an open letter from more than 100 Nobel laureates urging Greenpeace to end its campaign against genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The organization's direct actions have sparked legal actions against Greenpeace activists,   such as fines and suspended sentences for destroying a test plot of genetically modified wheat[http://www.biofortified.org/2013/06/gmo-crops-vandalized-in-oregon/ GMO crops vandalized in Oregon], Karl Haro von Mogel, Biology Fortified, 24 June 2013. and damaging the Nazca Lines, a UN World Heritage site in Peru.  [PAR] History [PAR] Origins [PAR] In the late 1960s, the U.S. had plans for an underground nuclear weapon test in the tectonically unstable island of Amchitka in Alaska. Because of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the plans raised some concerns of the test triggering earthquakes and causing a tsunami. A 1969 demonstration of 7,000  people blocked a major U.S.\u2013Canadian border crossing in British Columbia, carrying signs reading \"Don't Make A Wave. It's Your Fault If Our Fault Goes\".  The protests did not stop the U.S. from detonating the bomb. [PAR] While no earthquake or tsunami followed the test, the opposition grew when the U.S. announced they would detonate a bomb five times more powerful than the first one. Among the opposers were Jim Bohlen, a veteran who had served in the U.S. Navy, and Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, who had recently become Quakers. As members of the Sierra Club Canada, they were frustrated by the lack of action by the organization. From Irving Stowe, Jim Bohlen learned of a form of passive resistance, \"bearing witness\", where objectionable activity is protested simply by mere presence. Jim Bohlen's wife Marie came up with the idea to sail to Amchitka, inspired by the anti-nuclear voyages of Albert Bigelow in 1958. The idea ended up in the press and was linked to The Sierra Club. The Sierra Club did not like this connection and in 1970 The Don't Make a Wave Committee was established for the protest. Early meetings were held in the Shaughnessy home of Robert Hunter and his wife Bobbi Hunter. Subsequently the Stowe home at 2775 Courtenay St. became the HQ.  As Rex Weyler put it in his chronology, Greenpeace, in 1969, Irving and Dorothy Stowe's \"quiet home on Courtenay Street would soon become a hub of monumental, global significance\". Some of the first Greenpeace meetings were held there. The first office was opened in a backroom, storefront on Cypress and West Broadway SE corner in Kitsilano, Vancouver.  Within half a year Greenpeace would move in to share the upstairs office space with The Society Promoting Environmental Conservation at 4th and Maple in Kitsilano.  [PAR] Irving Stowe arranged a benefit concert (supported by Joan Baez) that took place on October 16, 1970 at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver. The concert created the financial basis for the first Greenpeace campaign.  Amchitka, the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace was",

[PAR] There has never been an openly gay president of the United States, but some historians have argued the first and only bachelor president , James Buchanan, may have had feelings for a member of the same sex. [PAR] The nation's 15th president is the nation's only bachelor president. A lifelong bachelor, Buchanan had a very close relationship with William Rufus De Vane King, a diplomat who served as U.S. senator and the nation's 13th vice president. King was the only vice president to never have been married. [PAR] Buchanan and King, in fact, lived together for more than two decades, although that was a relatively common practice in the 1800s. [PAR] Buchanan the Bachelor President [PAR] Historians who believe Buchanan and King were intimate often cite their contemporaries in Washington, who reportedly described King as being effeminate and called him \"Miss Nancy\" and Buchanan's \"better half.\" [PAR] They also cite letters written by Buchanan about the man described as his soulmate. [PAR] After King left the United States to become the minister to France, Buchanan wrote to a friend: [PAR] \"I am now solitary and alone, having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone; and should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.\" [PAR] Also, King showed his own affection for Buchanan at his departure by writing to him: \"I am selfish enough to hope you will not be able to procure an associate who will cause you to feel no regret at our separation.\" [PAR] Historians Claim Buchanan Was Gay [PAR] James Loewen, a prominent American sociologist and historian, has been the most outspoken academic who claims Buchanan was the first gay president. [PAR] \"There can be no doubt that James Buchanan was gay, before, during, and after his four years in the White House,\" Loewen wrote in a 2012 essay. \"Moreover, the nation knew it, too - he was not far into the closet. Today, I know no historian who has studied the matter and thinks Buchanan was heterosexual.\" [PAR] Loewen has argued that Buchanan's homosexuality is not often discussed in modern times because Americans do not want to believe society was more tolerant of gay relationships in the 19th Century than they are now. [PAR] Loewen does not explain, however, how or why a gay Buchanan had been engaged to a woman long before he became president. The woman, Ann Coleman, died and the two never wed. [PAR] Bachelor Presidential Candidate in 2016 [PAR] The closest the nation has come to having a bachelor president after Buchanan was in the 2016 election , when Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina sought the party's presidential nomination. Graham's candidacy was shortlived, however. Had he been elected, however, he said he'd have a \"rotating first lady.\" [PAR] \"Well, I've got a sister, she could play that role if necessary,\" Graham also joked. [PAR] Barack Obama as First Gay President [PAR] President Barack Obama has been described as being the first gay president, a symbolic label first used in a May 2012 Newsweek magazine headline. [PAR] The Democrat earned the label during his first term for his vocal support of gay marriage in May 2012 , making him the the first president in U.S. history to take such a position. [PAR] Obama is married to Michelle Obama , and the couple has two daughters. [PAR] Newsweek Cover [PAR] Newsweek's editor, Tina Brown , explained the term and picture of Obama with a rainbow halo superimposed over his head this way: [PAR] \"If President Clinton was the \u2018first black president\u2019 then Obama earns every stripe in that \u2018gaylo\u2019 with last week\u2019s gay marriage proclamation ,\" Brown told the online news site Politico",

The blessings continued through Jacob's father, Isaac , then to Jacob and his descendants. Jacob's sons became leaders of the 12 tribes of Israel . [PAR] The younger of twins, Jacob was born holding on to his brother Esau 's heel. His name means \"he grasps the heel\" or \"he deceives.\" Jacob lived up to his name. He and his mother Rebekah cheated Esau out of his birthright and blessing. Later in Jacob's life, God renamed him Israel, which means \"he struggles with God.\" [PAR] In fact, Jacob struggled with God his entire life, as many of us do. As he matured in faith , Jacob depended on God more and more. But the turning point for Jacob came after a dramatic, all-night wrestling match with God. In the end, the Lord touched Jacob's hip and he was a broken man, but also a new man. From that day forward, Jacob was called Israel.

He stars in 33 novels and 54 short stories, including some of Christie's most successful such as Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile . [PAR] Poirot and Christie [PAR] One of Christie\u2019s later regrets was that Hercule Poirot began his literary life too mature: \"the result is that my fictional detective is well over a hundred by now.\" And it is no secret that character and author did not always see eye to eye. [PAR] \u201cThere are moments when I have felt: \u2018Why-why-why did I ever invent this detestable, bombastic, tiresome little creature?\u2019\u2026. But now, I must confess it, Hercule Poirot has won. A reluctant affection has sprung up for him\u2026\u201d Agatha Christie\u2019s introduction to the serialisation of Appointment With Death in the Daily Mail, 1938. [PAR] Christie grew tired of Poirot's idiosyncrasies so much so that she wrote Curtain: Poirot's Last Case in the 1940s. It was locked in a safe until 1974 when it was finally published, earning Poirot a well-deserved obituary in The New York Times; he is the only fictional character to have received such an honour. [PAR] Playing Poirot [PAR] The first actor to take on the role of the little Belgian was Charles Laughton in 1928 in the theatrical debut of Alibi. Austin Trevor was the first Poirot on screen in 1931, and went on to star in three films. There was Tony Randall in 1965 and Academy Award nominee Albert Finney in the all-star classic Murder on the Orient Express in 1974. The great Peter Ustinov, winner of two Academy Awards, played Poirot in six films and despite not physically resembling the character is still much loved worldwide. There was even a Japanese anim\u00e9 version of Poirot, broadcast in 2004. [PAR] Perhaps, however, the actor most synonymous with Hercule Poirot is David Suchet, who first took on the role in 1989. Christie never saw David Suchet's portrayal but her grandson, Mathew Prichard, thinks that she would have approved; Suchet balances \u201c",

Their coalition was re-elected by a landslide following the Armistice.  Law persuaded the Conservatives to end the coalition, and work as an independent party. Conservative withdrawal forced Lloyd George to resign. The King then invited Law to form a new administration in 1922. Law's 'Tranquility Manifesto' was an attempt to allow Britain to recover from war damage. Though elected, he lasted just 209 days in office. He resigned in May 1923 due to ill health. [PAR] Stanley Baldwin, Conservative Prime Minister from 1923, 1924-9, 1935-7, played a leading part in a Conservative rebellion which overthrew the coalition government and the premiership of Lloyd George. In Bonar Law's Conservative government he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. When Bonar Law retired through illness in May 1923, Baldwin became prime minister. Determined to help reduce unemployment, in November he called a general election to seek support for a policy of trade protection. Failing to retain a majority, his government resigned in January 1924. Its replacement, the first Labour government also lacked an overall majority, and after it was defeated in another general election in October 1924, Baldwin returned as prime minister. [PAR] James Ramsay MacDonald, Labour Prime Minister from 1924 and 1929-35, became chairman of the parliamentary Labour group in 1911. As the Labour Party grew, however, he was criticised as being too moderate. His opposition to the Great War made him more unpopular still. In 1924 was asked by George V to form a government when Stanley Baldwin's small Conservative majority proved ungovernable. In his second minority government in 1929, the economic crises, including the doubling of unemployment levels, persuaded him to include the opposition leaders in a cross-party National Government. [PAR] During the 1931 financial and political crisis, Baldwin contributed to the formation of a 'National' coalition government, led by the former Labour prime minister, MacDonald. As Lord President of the Council, Baldwin at first sought to promote international disarmament, warning of the difficulty of defence against air attack: 'the bomber will always get through'. But as the threat from Nazi Germany became obvious, he accepted the need for rearmament and introduced new defence programmes each year from 1934 to 1937, against Labour and Liberal opposition. [PAR] Baldwin became prime minister of the National government in June 1935. In the autumn he won a general election, promising to continue to strengthen national defences. When seeking to avoid war with Mussolini's Italy over Abyssinia in order to focus effort against Hitler's Germany, his Cabinet was embarrassed by premature disclosure of a compromise settlement ('the Hore-Laval pact'). In retrospect the National Government's policy of combining armed deterrence with efforts to bind Hitler and Mussolini into a general European settlement seemed insufficient, and after the Second World War broke out in 1939 Baldwin became a leading target for those - especially Churchill - who thought more could have been done to accelerate rearmament and prevent war. [PAR] Neville Chamberlain, Conservative Prime Minister from 1937-40,  succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister in May 1937. War was brewing in Europe, and had already exploded in Spain. Chamberlain was unwilling to go down in history as responsible for an inevitably destructive war without doing everything possible to prevent it. Neville Chamberlain, as with many in Europe who had witnessed the horrors of the First World War and its aftermath, was committed to peace at almost any price. Chamberlain famously met German chancellor Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938 the result of which was an agreement that Britain and Germany would never again go to war. \"I believe,\" he declared on his return to the UK, \"it is peace for our time.\" However, the success of 'appeasement' was shortlived, as Hitler occupied Prague the following year. The subsequent invasion of Poland forced Chamberlain's hand, and he declared war on",

If the skin of a typical 150-pound (68-kilogram) adult male were stretched out flat, it would cover about 2 square yards (1.7 square meters) and weigh about 9 pounds (4 kilograms). Our skin protects the network of muscles, bones, nerves, blood vessels, and everything else inside our bodies. Our eyelids have the thinnest skin, the soles of our feet the thickest. [PAR] Hair is actually a modified type of skin. Hair grows everywhere on the human body except the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips. Hair grows more quickly in summer than winter, and more slowly at night than during the day. [PAR] Like hair, nails are a type of modified skin. Nails protect the sensitive tips of fingers and toes. Human nails aren't necessary for living, but they do provide support for the tips of the fingers and toes, protect them from injury, and aid in picking up small objects. Without them, we'd have a hard time scratching an itch or untying a knot. Nails can be an indicator of a person's general health, and illness often affects their growth. [PAR] continue [PAR] Skin Basics [PAR] Skin is essential in many ways. It forms a barrier that prevents harmful substances and microorganisms from entering the body. It protects body tissues against injury. It also controls the loss of life-sustaining fluids like blood and water, helps regulate body temperature through perspiration (sweating), and protects from the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays. [PAR] Without the nerve cells in skin, people couldn't feel warmth, cold, or other sensations. For instance, goosebumps form when the erector pili muscles contract to make hairs on the skin stand up straight when someone is cold, excited,\u00a0or frightened \u2014 the blood vessels keep the body from losing heat by narrowing as much as possible and keeping the warm blood away from the skin's surface, offering insulation and protection. [PAR] Every square inch of skin contains thousands of cells and hundreds of sweat glands, oil glands, nerve endings, and blood vessels. Skin is made up of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous tissue. [PAR] The upper layer of our skin, the epidermis, is the tough, protective outer layer. It's about as thick as a sheet of paper over most parts of the body. The epidermis has four layers of cells that are constantly flaking off and being renewed. In these four layers are three special types of cells: [PAR] Melanocytes produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. All people have roughly the same number of melanocytes; the more melanin that is produced, the darker the skin. Exposure to sunlight increases the production of melanin, which is why people get suntanned or freckled. [PAR] Keratinocytes produce keratin, a type of protein that is a basic component of hair, skin, nails, and helps create an intact barrier. [PAR] Langerhans cells help protect the body against infection. [PAR] Because the cells in the epidermis are completely replaced about every 28 days, cuts and scrapes heal quickly. [PAR] Below the epidermis is the next layer of our skin, the dermis, which is made up of blood vessels, nerve endings, and connective tissue. The dermis nourishes the epidermis. Two types of fibers in the dermis \u2014 collagen and elastin \u2014 help the skin stretch when we bend and reposition itself when we straighten up. Collagen is strong and hard to stretch, and elastin, as its name suggests, is elastic. In older people, some of the elastin-containing fibers degenerate, which is one reason why the skin looks wrinkled. [PAR] The dermis also contains a person's sebaceous glands. These glands, which surround and empty into hair follicles and pores, produce the oil sebum that lubricates the skin and hair. Sebaceous glands are found mostly in the skin on the face, upper back, shoulders, and chest. [PAR] Most",

[PAR] Warhead 2000 (proposed) [PAR] Never Say Never Again is the second James Bond theatrical film not produced by EON Productions and the second film adaptation of the story Thunderball . Released in 1983, it stars Sean Connery as British Secret Service agent James Bond. It was released theatrically by Warner Bros. [PAR] The film is not considered part of the canon of the Bond film franchise from EON Productions and United Artists , despite its currently being handled by the official film series distributor, MGM. MGM acquired the distribution rights in 1997 after their acquisition of Orion Pictures. The film also marks the culmination of a long legal battle between United Artists and Kevin McClory . Its release opposite the franchise Bond film Octopussy (starring Roger Moore ) quickly led the media to dub the situation the \" Battle of the Bonds \". [PAR] In November 2013, the McClory Estate and EON Productions reached an agreement transferring all rights to Fleming's Thunderball, the organization of [PAR] , and the character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld to EON. [PAR] Contents [PAR] [ show ] [PAR] Plot summary [PAR] Being the second adaptation of the novel Thunderball, Never Say Never Again follows a similar plotline to the earlier film, but with some differences. [PAR] The film opens with a middle-aged, yet still athletic James Bond making his way through an armed camp in order to rescue a girl who has been kidnapped. After killing the kidnappers, Bond lets his guard down, forgetting that the girl might have been subject to Stockholm syndrome (in which a kidnapped person comes to identify with his/her kidnappers) and is stabbed to death by her. Or so it seems. [PAR] In fact, the attack on the camp is nothing more than a field training exercise using blank ammunition and fake knives, and one Bond fails because he ends up \"dead\". A new M is now in office, one who sees little use for the 00-section. In fact, Bond has spent most of his recent time teaching, rather than doing, a fact he points out with some resentment. [PAR] Feeling that Bond is slipping, M orders him to enroll in a health clinic in order to \"eliminate all those free radicals\" and get back into shape. While there, Bond discovers a mysterious nurse, Fatima Blush , and her patient, who is wrapped in bandages. His suspicions are aroused even further when a thug (Lippe) tries to kill him. [PAR] Blush and her charge, an American Air Force pilot named Jack Petachi , are in fact operatives of [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] , a criminal organization run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his retinas to match the retinal pattern of the American President. Using his position as a pilot, and the president's eye pattern to circumvent security, Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world. [PAR] M reluctantly reactivates the 00 section, and Bond is assigned the task of tracking down the missing weapons, beginning with a rendezvous with Domino Petachi , the pilot's sister, who is kept a virtual prisoner by her lover, Maximillian Largo . Bond pursues Largo and his yacht to the Bahamas , where he engages Domino, Fatima Blush, and Largo in a game of wits and resources as he attempts to derail [PAR] SPECTRE [PAR] 's scheme. [PAR] Changes to the Bond universe [PAR] The film makes a few changes to the James Bond universe. MI6 is shown to be underfunded and understaffed, particularly with regards to Q-Branch, and the character",
