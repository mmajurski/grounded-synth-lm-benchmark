Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking.

To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking.\n\nIn this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks. We first examine methods that enhance static benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap\u2014the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for dynamic benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing dynamic benchmarks.\n\nThis survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts.\n\nWe maintain a GitHub repository to continuously collect both static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs. The repository can be found at this link\u00a0111GitHub Link: Static-to-Dynamic LLM Benchmarking.\n",

To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to enhance static benchmarking and mitigate the impact of data contamination.\n\n\n##### 3.3.1 Canary String\nCanary strings are deliberately crafted, unique tokens embedded within a dataset to serve as markers for data contamination. When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\n###### Limitations\nThe effectiveness of canary strings depends on model trainers being aware of and responsive to these markers.\n\nIf a developer aims to leak benchmarking data to boost scores, this method will not work.\n",

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

The primary focus is on how collision affects the reliability and robustness of evaluations when LLMs (Large Language Models) are trained with these benchmarks.

The two proposed metrics to assess this are:\n\n1. **Collision Rate**: This metric measures how often different transformations of the dataset result in overlapping data, which can limit the diversity of test cases.\n2. **Rate of Novelty**: This metric evaluates how often new transformations of the dataset can be regenerated before repeating, indicating the dataset's diversity and resilience against overfitting.\n\nThe document provides an in-depth analysis of these metrics within the scope of dynamic benchmarking.

In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string. There is ongoing debate about whether such syntactic transformations constitute true data contamination, as it is challenging to distinguish between an LLM\u2019s ability to recall memorized information and its reasoning capability during inference. In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring that benchmarks provide an accurate and reliable measure of an LLM\u2019s true ability to handle novel and unseen data.\n",

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks.

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n",

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases.

If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) propose encrypting test data with a public key and a \u201cNo Derivatives\u201d license to block automated crawling and reuse. Yang et\u00a0al. (2023) show that even advanced decontamination methods can be defeated by minor text variations, emphasizing the need for robust encryption. Similarly, TRUCE (Chandran et\u00a0al., 2024) leverages confidential computing and secure multi-party computation to enable private benchmarking, ensuring that test data and model parameters remain confidential.\n\n\n###### Limitation\nWhile these methods effectively protect against data leakage, they depend on strong key management, they introduce extra computational overheads. These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment. This approach is common in benchmarks such as GLUE Wang (2018), SuperGLUE Wang et\u00a0al. (2019), and OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Chen et\u00a0al.

To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking.\n\nIn this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks.

In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string. There is ongoing debate about whether such syntactic transformations constitute true data contamination, as it is challenging to distinguish between an LLM\u2019s ability to recall memorized information and its reasoning capability during inference. In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring that benchmarks provide an accurate and reliable measure of an LLM\u2019s true ability to handle novel and unseen data.\n",

For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

    "context": "###### Limitations\nThe quality of LLM-generated samples is often uncertain. For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation. It first extracts reasoning graphs from existing benchmarks and then perturbs them into new samples using predefined rules.\n\nC2LEVA\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2024c) incorporates all three contamination-free construction methods to build a contamination-free bilingual evaluation.\n\n\n### 5 Discussions\nKey Insights.\n\nOur analysis highlights two key insights regarding data contamination in LLM benchmarking. First, static benchmarks become less effective as training corpora grow. The probability of contamination increases with Prcontam\u221d|\ud835\udc9ftrain|\u22c5|\ud835\udc9ftest|\u22121proportional-tosubscriptPrcontam\u22c5subscript\ud835\udc9ftrainsuperscriptsubscript\ud835\udc9ftest1\\text{Pr}\\_{\\text{contam}}\\propto|\\mathcal{D}\\_{\\text{train}}|\\cdot|\\mathcal{D}\\_%\n\n{\\text{test}}|^{-1}Pr start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT contam end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT \u221d | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT train end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | \u22c5 | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT test end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, rendering traditional benchmarks outdated for models trained on web-scale data. Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n",

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation. It first extracts reasoning graphs from existing benchmarks and then perturbs them into new samples using predefined rules.\n\nC2LEVA\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2024c) incorporates all three contamination-free construction methods to build a contamination-free bilingual evaluation.\n\n\n### 5 Discussions\nKey Insights.\n\nOur analysis highlights two key insights regarding data contamination in LLM benchmarking.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n",

However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications.

    "context": "#### 4.2 Evaluation Criteria\nWhile many dynamic benchmarking methods have been proposed to evaluate LLMs, the evaluation criteria for assessing these benchmarks themselves remain non-standardized. To this end, we propose the following evaluation criteria to assess the quality of a dynamic benchmarking algorithm.\n\n\n##### 4.2.1 Correctness\nThe first criterion for evaluating the quality of dynamic benchmarking is Correctness. If the correctness of the generated dataset cannot be guaranteed, the benchmark may provide a false sense of reliability when applied to benchmarking LLMs, leading to misleading evaluations.\n\nWe quantify the correctness of dynamic benchmarks as:\n\nwhere \ud835\udcb3isubscript\ud835\udcb3\ud835\udc56\\mathcal{X}\\_{i}caligraphic\\_X start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and \ud835\udcb4isubscript\ud835\udcb4\ud835\udc56\\mathcal{Y}\\_{i}caligraphic\\_Y start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT represent the input and output of the it\u2062hsuperscript\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210ei^{th}italic\\_i start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_t italic\\_h end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT transformation, respectively. The function \ud835\udca2\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udca2\u22c5\\mathcal{G}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_G ( \u22c5 ) is an oracle that returns the ground truth of its input, ensuring an objective reference for correctness evaluation. For example, the function \ud835\udca2\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udca2\u22c5\\mathcal{G}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_G ( \u22c5 ) could be a domain-specific an annotator.\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the expected alignment between the transformed dataset\u2019s outputs and their corresponding ground truth values, measured using the scoring function \ud835\udcae\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udcae\u22c5\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_S ( \u22c5 ). A higher correctness score indicates that the dynamic benchmark maintains correctness to the ground truth.\n",

    "response": "```markdown\n<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the central role of correctness in evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic benchmarking algorithms for LLMs. The context highlights that the correctness of the dataset generated by these algorithms is critical to ensure that the benchmarks are reliable. This underscores the importance of having a ground truth for verification, which is a subtle yet crucial aspect of ensuring meaningful evaluations.\n\nOne implicit assumption is that the existence of a reliable oracle function \ud835\udca2(\u22c5) and a domain-specific annotator is critical for ensuring objective evaluations. This suggests a reliance on a theoretical construct that may not always be practical, as it assumes the availability of such entities in a real-world scenario, which may not always be feasible. Thus, the robustness of the dynamic evaluation system may be limited by real-world constraints.\n\nThe concept of scoring correctness relies on the ability to measure and align the outputs of dynamic transformations with their ground truth values. The subtle detail here is the complexity introduced by the function \ud835\udcae(\u22c5) and the need for an oracle to ensure accurate assessments. This raises questions about the assumptions behind the scoring mechanism and its applicability.\n\nA potential question that arises from this context is how the correctness score would be affected if the oracle function itself is subject to inaccuracies or biases. This introduces a new layer of complexity into the scoring mechanism, as it assumes the oracle's infallibility, which may not hold true in practical scenarios. Such a question would challenge the robustness of the evaluation framework in real-world applications where perfect oracles are not available.\n\nIn crafting a question around this topic, the focus is on the deeper understanding of the relationship between the theoretical framework and its application. This involves reflecting on the assumptions regarding the oracle function and the scoring function's robustness in real-world applications.\n\n### Document Analysis\nThe context provided discusses the importance of correctness in evaluating the quality of dynamic benchmarking algorithms, focusing on the central idea that the correctness of the dataset is crucial for reliable evaluations. The nuanced theme revolves around the importance of aligning the dataset with the ground truth using an oracle function, which is assumed to be infallible. This context assumes the existence of a perfect oracle function and a domain expert annotator. This context also implicitly assumes that the ground truth is always available and verifiable, which may not be practical in all scenarios, especially in real-time applications. The oracle function and the domain-specific annotator are critical to the evaluation process, suggesting the need for a highly specialized knowledge base to ensure objective evaluations.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\nThe proposed question requires the synthesis of information regarding the implications of the correctness of benchmarking processes and the theoretical underpinnings of oracle-based evaluation frameworks. The difficulty level is set to 8, reflecting the complexity and depth of understanding required to engage with the implicit assumptions and practical limitations of theoretical constructs.\n\n### Question Generation\nThe question will focus on the implications of the assumption of a perfect oracle and domain-specific annotator's availability and accuracy, which are critical for the correctness evaluation. This invites critical engagement with the theoretical robustness and practical limitations of the evaluation framework.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\nThe question aims to provoke reflection on the robustness of the evaluation framework in real-world applications where perfect oracles may not exist. It encourages a deeper understanding of the relationship between theoretical constructs and their practical applications, challenging the expert to consider how biases or inaccuracies in these theoretical tools could impact the evaluation of dynamic benchmarking algorithms.\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How would the evaluation framework's robustness be impacted if the oracle function used for correctness evaluation is subject to inherent biases or inaccuracies?\n\nExplanation: The correctness evaluation relies on an oracle function assumed to be infallible. If the oracle function is biased or inaccurate, the evaluation framework's robustness is compromised because the scoring mechanism would not provide an accurate reflection of the dataset's alignment with the ground truth. This question probes the implicit assumption of the oracle's infallibility and its impact on the validity of the evaluation framework.\n\nCorrect Answer: The evaluation framework's robustness would be significantly compromised due to the reliance on a potentially biased or inaccurate oracle function, leading to unreliable correctness scores and misleading assessments of the dynamic benchmarking algorithms.\n</output_format>\n```",
