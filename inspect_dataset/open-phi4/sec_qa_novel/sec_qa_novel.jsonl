Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.

[SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API.

Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering.

Tokenization {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__tokenization}\nTokenization may be used as part of an access control scheme to protect sensitive information. Information that would be\n\nhighly valuable if compromised is replaced with a random token known to the parties involved in the transaction. In a\n\ntypically scenario once the tokens have been established, only the token is sent out over an untrusted network.\n\nImagine you don't want your credit card number exposed to merchants. One solution would be if you used a payment service\n\nthat issued you a new credit card number for each transaction. This credit card number would only be valid for a single\n\ntransaction and would be billed to your regular credit card (which the payment service would have access to). In this\n\ncase the token is the one-time-use credit card number and the sensitive information is your actual credit card number.\n\nPayment services like ApplePay and GoogleWallet do exactly this.\n\n:::\n\n:::::::::::::::::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"7.4. Lab: Linux File Permissions\"}\n\n\n## 7.4. Lab: Linux File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_linux_file_permissions}\nIn this lab we are going to explore UNIX style file permissions and determine what they can do and why they are limited.\n\nFinally we will see how Linux ACLs provide more flexibility in assigning permissions.\n\nWe will be working in a vanilla Ubuntu container and installing software and adding users manually. Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

    "context": "### 7.2.3. Key Cards {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__key_cards}\nMany security measures employ key cards for access to rooms. A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended. SFTP uses an SSH connection to send and receive files over an encrypted\n\nchannel. SFTP also supports all SSH authentication methods.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.4.15. SNMP\"}\n",

Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

Typically it is suggested to use \\\"something you have and something you know\\\" for example the code in\n\nan SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password (you know your password).\n\nThere are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the time based creation of a code. [Google\n\nAuthenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US){.link}\n\nand [Authy](https://authy.com/){.link} are each phone applications which generate codes from a cryptographic seed which\n\nis synced with the verifying system. RSA IDs generate similar codes on a dedicated hardware device.\n\n:::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC\"}\n",

Load balancers distribute work, in\n\nthe form of external client requests, among the internal resources, typically servers.\n\nFor example, if a company has four servers supporting a web application, they may employ a reverse proxy load balancer\n\nthat takes requests from clients and passes that request to one of the four internal servers. Different metrics are used\n\nto determine how the servers are utilized including least used (round robin), weighted, least amount of active\n\nconnections.

Given the growth of working from\n\nhome, almost all users have become familiar with what a VPN is and what it does.\n\nSite-to-site VPNs are typically used for linking offices together. This kind of VPN is on permanently. An example would\n\nbe linking two college campuses: NJIT Newark and NJIT Jersey City. In this scenario users on either campus expect to be\n\nable to connect securely to services on the opposite campus at all times. The traffic is encrypted and carried over the\n\nInternet.\n\nRemote access VPNs are used by individuals connecting in to a secure network. This kind of VPN is usually stated through\n\na application such as Cisco AnyConnect. When the application is running the user is able to securely access internal\n\nresources as if they were at the office.\n\nMany vendors offer VPN products including Cisco, Citrix, Fortinet, Palo Alto, and Checkpoint.

    "context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

    "context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

By isolating the infected asset, we can help prevent this.\n\nThere are a few other tools for containing malware such as sandboxing and snapshots. Sandboxing refers to the practice\n\nof running processes in a controlled environment on a machine. Most web browsers sandbox the JavaScript they run,\n\nmeaning that if a website is serving malicious JS it should not be able to affect anything else on the machine.\n\nSnapshots refer to periodically saving the state of the storage device on a machine.

Backups make recovery much simpler and\n\ncompanies that do not have a backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That being said, malware\n\nmay have also found its way into the backups if given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically\n\ndestroyed and a new one is built.

The core idea revolves around understanding and managing access control and permissions, which are crucial in securing digital environments. The discussion of permissions, particularly around SSH and HTTP access, implies a deeper understanding of secure communication and the management of digital identities. Here, we focus on the technical aspects of SSH keys, the nuances of access control lists, and the broader implications for secure communications and compliance management.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**\n   - The context describes how access is managed, permissions, and the configuration for users. This implies a deeper understanding of digital identity management, a central aspect of securing digital identities.\n   \n2. **Concept Exploration**\n   - The context implicitly discusses the importance of secure protocols in managing digital identities and the security implications of SSH keys. The underlying theory revolves around secure communication and the management of digital identities.\n   \n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**\n   - We rate the difficulty as high, given the need for a domain expert to apply this knowledge in a real-world setting.\n   \n4. **Intentional Question Planning**\n   - The question should encourage a deep engagement with the content, critically reflect on implications, and clearly demonstrate understanding and competency in the management of digital identities. The question must be challenging and require synthesis of high-level understanding beyond the specific context.\n\n## Analysis Phase\n\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n- The context discusses user permissions and the configuration settings for secure access.\n- Central ideas include understanding the configuration of SSH keys and HTTP access, which are critical in managing digital identities.\n- Key concepts include the implications of access control and the management of permissions.\n\n### Identification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information\n- Explicitly disregard the headers, footers, and any content clearly irrelevant to the core information on text chunk.\n- Detect and exclude any information that appears nonsensical or disconnected from the primary subject matter.\n\n### Decision Criteria for Question Generation\n- The content is meaningful and educationally valuable.\n- The context consists of relevant and significant information.\n\n## Output\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of digital identity management, why is the principle of least privilege particularly crucial in managing SSH keys, and how does it impact the security of digital identities in secure communication?\nExplanation: The correct answer draws from the necessity of understanding how access controls are managed. The principle of least privilege ensures that only necessary permissions are granted, which minimizes security risks.\nCorrect Answer: The principle of least privilege is crucial to ensure that only necessary permissions are granted, thereby reducing potential security breaches and safeguarding digital identities.\n</output_format>\n```[0]: import re\n\n[1]: import logging\n\n[2]: from typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\n[3]: from .types import Card\n[4]: from .utils import is_thirteen_orphans, is_gang, is_qing_yi_see, is_qing_yi_tong, is_qing_yi_pon, is_pung, is_qing_yi_pon_2, is_qing_yi_pon_3, is_qing_yi_pon_4\n[5]: from .utils import is_chi_tile, is_pon, is_qing_yi_see, get_card_index\n\n[7]: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n[7]: class Game:\n\n[7]:     def __init__(self, players: list, cards: list, logs: list):\n[8]:         self.players = players\n[9]:         self.cards = cards\n[7]:         self.logs = logs\n\n[8]:     def get_player_index(self, player):\n[9]:         return self.players.index(player)\n\n[10]:     def get_player_cards(self, player):\n[14]:         return self.players[self.get_player_index(player)].cards\n\n[15]:     def get_player_index(self, player):\n[16]:         return self.players.index(player)\n\n[17]:     def is_hu(self, player, hand_cards, card, player=None):\n[17]:         # print(self.player)\n[18]:     # for card in handcards:\n[14]:     #     if card[\"card\"] == \"E_West\":\n[19]:     #         card[\"card\"] = \"M_West\"\n\n[20]:     # \u786e\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\u6760\u82b1\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\n[21]:     card_type = 0\n[22]:     is_need_other = False\n[23]:     for t in hand_cards:\n[24]:         if t[\"type\"] == \"Ting\":\n[25]:             card_type = 1\n[26]:             break\n[27]:         elif t[\"type\"] == \"Pon\" or t[\"type\"] == \"Kong\":\n[28]:             card_type += t[\"number\"]\n[29]:             if t[\"number\"] == 4:\n[30]:                 is_need_other = True\n\n[31]:     # \u80e1\u724c\u5224\u65ad\n[32]:     if card_type == 0:\n[33]:         # \u6ca1\u6709\u6760\u724c \u6ca1\u6709\u5929\u542c\n[34]:         is_hu, is_qing_yi_see = self.is_qing_yi_see(hand_cards, card)\n[35]:         is_tian_hu = False\n[36]:         if is_hu:\n[37]:             return is_hu, card_type, is_tian_hu, is_qing_yi_see\n[38]:         else:\n[39]:             # \u80e1\u724c\u5224\u65ad\n[40]:             card_value = int(card[1:-1])\n[41]:             qiang_type = 0\n[42]:             for t in hand_cards:\n[43]:                 qiang_type += t[\"number\"]\n[44]:                 for c in t[\"cards\"]:\n[45]:                     c_value = int(c[1:-1])\n[46]:                     if c[0] == card[0] and (c_value + 1 == card_value or c_value -

Lab: Exploiting log4j {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_exploiting_log4j}\nIn this lab we will examine the log4j vulnerability,\n\n[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228){.link}. This vulnerability takes advantage of a flaw\n\nin a common logging library used by many Java applications, including Apache, neo4j, Steam, iCloud, and Minecraft. Any\n\nattacker that can cause a message to be logged can use the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) and cause the\n\ntarget to reach out to another server, LDAP in our example, and load a remote Java class file. This file can contain any\n\ncode that the attacker wishes to inject into the server process.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nDo some research: What versions of log4j are affected by this vulnerability?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nThis lab uses a Docker Compose configuration to simulate a network with an attacker and a target.

FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

In\n\nthe age of cloud computing network security as a service is becoming increasingly popular.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.1. Firewall\"}\n\n\n### 6.3.1. Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks.

Since there aren't enough\n\nIPv4 addresses a typical internet user is assigned a local address that gets translated to an external IPv4 address when\n\nthey route their packets through their router. This is referred to as Network Address Translation (NAT) and is usually\n\nhandled by an all-in-one device that also makes sure external entities cannot connect to the internal network.\n\nWith IPv6 addresses each host on that same *internal* network can be given an external IPv6 address. A *basic* IPv6\n\nrouter may simply pass the packets to the network without blocking connections to the internal network. If the machines\n\nare not hardened or a firewall is not put in place/enabled the machines could be subject to attack.\n\nAs a computer security specialist it is important to test not only IPv4 connectivity, but also IPv6 to ensure that your\n\nnetwork is configured appropriately.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.2.2.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).

AD is a\n\nMicrosoft technology that enables centralized network management. It has proven to be very scalable and is commonly\n\ndeployed in the enterprise environment (corporations, universities, schools, etc.)\n\nActive Directory relies upon the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for its communications. While AD is\n\nprobably the largest deployed user of LDAP other implementations for various operating systems exist, including Apple\n\nOpenDirectory, RH Directory Server, and OpenLDAP. LDAP is often used by internal applications and process.\n\nThe cornerstone of an AD environment is the Domain Controller (DC). DCs stores directory information about Users,\n\nGroups, Computers, Policies, and more. They respond to auth requests for the domain (network) they are supporting. A\n\nstandard network will have multiple DCs with fail-over in place in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor many environments, AD is the mechanism used for authentication, authorization, and accounting. As many services have\n\nmigrated to the web, the need to access AD from anywhere has become increasingly important. This has kindled the growth\n\nof Azure Active Directory, a cloud-based version of active directory.

FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in\n\nembedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, `ftp`{.literal}, a graphical client such as Filezilla or\n\nSecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the `ftp://`{.literal} URL scheme.\n\nUnfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext.\n\nAs such Secure FTP (SFTP) is recommended.

A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission.

This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.
