Central to the question topic is the correlation between FGA and total points scored, and nuances in scoring efficiency. Key data points:\n- Wilt\u2019s 100 points: 36/63 FG (100 pts)\n- Kobe\u2019s 81 points: 28/46 FG\n- Wilt\u2019s 78: 31/62\n- Wilt\u2019s 73s: 29/48 and 29/43\n- David Thompson\u2019s 73: 28/38\n- Elgin Baylor\u2019s 71: 28/48\n- David Robinson\u2019s 70: 26/41\n\nThe most efficient performance in terms of points per field goal attempt emerges by calculating total points divided by FGA.
