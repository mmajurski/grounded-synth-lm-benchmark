However, no research on alexithymia has been done among general medical outpatients who present with medically unexplained physical symptoms as their main problem and in which anxiety and depression have been considered as possible confounding factors. This study investigated whether patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are more alexithymic than those with explained symptoms and whether, in patients with unexplained symptoms, alexithymia is associated with subjective health experience and use of medical services.\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among patients attending an internal medicine outpatient clinic. All patients were given a standardized interview and completed a number of questionnaires.\n\nAfter complete physical examinations, 169 of 321 patients had unexplained physical symptoms according to two independent raters. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms more often had a mental disorder, but overall they were not more alexithymic. In patients with unexplained physical symptoms, alexithymia was not associated with subjective health experience or use of medical services. However, patients with both unexplained symptoms and a mental disorder who also denied any possible connection between emotional problems and their physical symptoms did have more alexithymic traits.\n\n",

Both enzymes have been measured simultaneously at our hospital allowing for a comparison of their diagnostic accuracy.\n\nSeventeen thousand five hundred and thirty-one measurements of either serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase were made on 10 931 patients treated at a metropolitan teaching hospital between January 2001 and May 2003. Of these, 8937 were initially treated in the Emergency Department. These results were collected in a database, which was linked by the patients' medical record number to the radiology and medical records. Patients with either an elevated lipase value or a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had their radiological diagnosis reviewed along with their biochemistry and histology record.

The medical records coded for pancreatitis in a further 55 whose enzymes were not elevated. Three hundred and twenty of these had radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis.

Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing.

We examined the relationship between body mass index and prostate specific antigen by age in men without prostate cancer in a longitudinal aging study to determine whether prostate specific antigen must be adjusted for body mass index.\n\nThe study population included 994 men (4,937 observations) without prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Mixed effects models were used to examine the relationship between prostate specific antigen and body mass index in kg/m(2) by age. Separate models were explored in men with prostate cancer censored at diagnosis, for percent body fat measurements, for weight changes with time and adjusting for initial prostate size in 483 men (2,523 observations) with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging measurements.\n\nIn men without prostate cancer body mass index was not significantly associated with prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age (p = 0.06). A 10-point body mass index increase was associated with a prostate specific antigen difference of -0.03 ng/ml (95% CI -0.40-0.49). Results were similar when men with prostate cancer were included, when percent body fat was substituted for body mass index, and after adjusting for prostate volume. Longitudinal weight changes also had no significant association with prostate specific antigen.\n\n",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or TGF-\u03b21, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related to steroid receptor expression.\n\nThis prospective study compared VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) expression.\n\nThe score of VEGF in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative phase (P=0.006).

Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center.\n\nWe retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins.

Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins during initial BCS is unknown.\n\nAll women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [\u22652 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed.\n\nOf 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p<0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043).\n\n",

However, reporting is subjective, semiquantitative, and potentially biased. Reporting decisions vary among CPs, and reports may not be interpreted by clinicians as intended.\n\nThe aims of this study were to survey clinicians and CPs about RBC-M terms and their clinical value, and identify areas of agreement and discordance.\n\nOnline surveys were distributed to small animal clinicians via the Veterinary Information Network and to CPs via the ASVCP listserv. A quiz assessed understanding of RBC-M terms among respondent groups. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze responses to survey questions, and quiz scores were compared among groups.\n\nAnalyzable responses were obtained from 1662 clinicians and 82 CPs. Both clinicians and CPs considered some terms, e.g., agglutination, useful, whereas only CPs considered other terms, e.g., ghost cells, useful. All groups interpreted certain terms, e.g., Heinz bodies, correctly, whereas some clinicians misinterpreted others, e.g., eccentrocytes. Responses revealed that CPs often do not report RBC-M they consider insignificant, when present in low numbers. Twenty-eight percent of clinicians think CPs review all blood smears while only 19% of CPs report reviewing all smears.\n\n",
