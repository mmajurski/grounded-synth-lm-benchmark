Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data. This bit of data is useless to the MitM.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.8. Sessions and Cookies\"}\n",

That is a process that is hard to compute\n\nin one direction, but easy to compute in the other. For example it is much easier for a computer to multiply large\n\nnumbers than to determine the factors of large numbers. This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n\n## Step 1: Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nThe provided context revolves around a lab exercise using nmap to scan a target machine's software and system configuration for potential security risks. The exercise involves setting up two Docker containers, one as the target machine (`victim`) and the other as the scanner (`scanner`). The `scanner` container uses nmap to perform various scans, including a ping scan, a SYN scan, and a full scan with version detection and OS fingerprinting.\n\n## Step 2: Concept Exploration\n\nImplicit assumptions in this context include the understanding of nmap's capabilities and the importance of security scanning in identifying potential vulnerabilities. Subtle details involve the use of Docker containers to simulate a network environment and the specific nmap commands used to perform the scans.\n\n## Step 3: Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI would rate the difficulty level of this context as 8 out of 10, as it requires a good understanding of nmap, Docker, and security scanning concepts.\n\n## Step 4: Intentional Question Planning\n\nGiven the complexity of the topic, the question should encourage a deep understanding of nmap's capabilities and its application in security scanning.

Security Plans {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__security_plans}\nWhile confronting such a diverse array of actors can seem daunting at first, the key element to being successful is\n\nhaving a plan.

Common Ports and Services {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__common_ports_and_services}\nPort numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host\n\nto have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and typically support a commonly used\n\nservice. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them. Lastly ports 49152 to 65535\n\nare used dynamically by applications as needed.\n\nIt is important to know some commonly used ports as the services running on these ports may be subject to an

Least Privilege {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__least_privilege}\nThe principle of least privilege states that an actor should only be given access to resources as necessary and with the\n\npermissions necessary to complete their task. These resources may be processes, programs, or even user accounts. This\n\nprinciple reduces an attack surface and helps stop the spread of malware as a single compromised account will not have\n\naccess to all of the resources.\n\nLeast privilege is also an important concept for compliance purposes. For example, laws may require and audit of all\n\naccounts that have Internet access. By limiting accounts that have Internet access to only the accounts of actors that\n\nrequire Internet access to complete their tasks, it makes it easier to be in compliance.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.1.2.

Some examples of identification would be usernames and passwords, token codes, a physical token, or\n\nbiometric data. Typically it is suggested to use \\\"something you have and something you know\\\" for example the code in\n\nan SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password (you know your password).\n\nThere are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the time based creation of a code.

Typically a security plan utilizes the three types of security controls available:\n\nphysical, administrative, and technical.\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Physical controls are things like door locks, cameras, or even the way rooms in a building are laid out. These things\n\n  can have a dramatic impact on the overall security and should not be overlooked!]{.principal}\n\n- [Administrative controls include human resources policies (HR), classifying and limiting access to data, and\n\n  separating duties.

In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them.

Domain names are the simple names people are\n\naccustomed to for websites, such as `njit.edu`{.literal} as opposed to `54.83.189.142`{.literal}. Names are\n\nsignificantly easier for people to remember than IP addresses. In order for a computer to resolve a name, it first\n\nqueries a local cache, then its primary DNS server. Assuming the DNS server cannot find the name it will query a Root\n\nserver for a Top Level Domain (TLD) server, which maintains a listing of Authoritative Nameservers for that particular\n\ndomain (edu, com, net, org, gov, etc.). Finally once an authoritative nameserver is found it will respond with the IP\n\naddress for that particular hostname which will be cached and sent back through the user's primary DNS server to the\n\nuser.\n\nDNS is designed to be resilient and decentralized but unfortunately the traffic is not authenticated or encrypted. This\n\nhas made it a target for MitM attacks. Likewise cache hits and misses [can yield information as to what names have been\n\nrecently resolved](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00509){.link} (as was the case in discovering the extent of the Sony\n\nRootkit). The recursive nature has of DNS has also allowed for DoS attacks in the past, but much of that has been solved\n\nby limiting recursive queries to the user-facing DNS servers (ie. the one given to you by your DHCP request).

Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7. Asymmetric Encryption\"}\n",

It highlights the importance of key exchange security in symmetric encryption and explores methods to ensure it. The example of the one-time-pad (OTP) is presented as a rare example of a secure symmetric encryption scheme.\n\n## Concept Exploration\n\nImplicitly, the context assumes that pre-shared keys are necessary for symmetric encryption, which poses a security risk if the channel used for key exchange is insecure. It also suggests that asymmetric encryption might be a more secure alternative, as it does not require pre-shared keys. The context further implies that secure communication or storage often relies on symmetric encryption due to its simplicity.\n\n## Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nDifficulty level: 8/10\n\nThe context requires a deep understanding of symmetric encryption, its security risks, and the importance of key exchange security. The example of the one-time-pad adds a layer of complexity, as it requires an understanding of how OTP works and its limitations.\n\n## Intentional Question Planning\n\nThe question should invite deeper understanding of the importance of key exchange security in symmetric encryption and how it can be ensured. It should also require the domain expert to critically reflect on the security risks associated with symmetric encryption and the trade-offs between security and simplicity.\n\n## Identification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information\n\nThe context includes a few irrelevant elements, such as the figure and the example title and content.

False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine.

Names are\n\nsignificantly easier for people to remember than IP addresses. In order for a computer to resolve a name, it first\n\nqueries a local cache, then its primary DNS server. Assuming the DNS server cannot find the name it will query a Root\n\nserver for a Top Level Domain (TLD) server, which maintains a listing of Authoritative Nameservers for that particular\n\ndomain (edu, com, net, org, gov, etc.). Finally once an authoritative nameserver is found it will respond with the IP\n\naddress for that particular hostname which will be cached and sent back through the user's primary DNS server to the\n\nuser.\n\nDNS is designed to be resilient and decentralized but unfortunately the traffic is not authenticated or encrypted.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

DNS is a\n\ndistributed system by design and is used for resolving domain names into IP addresses. Due to the distributed nature of\n\nthe system, protocols were built in for having a single domain served by multiple servers. These servers pass\n\ninformation to each other using a DNS zone transfer.\n\nTypically these communications should be internal as they may leak valuable information regarding the zone.\n\nUnfortunately an improperly configured DNS server may advertise its zone transfers publicly.

Domain hijacking occurs when an attacker gains control of a popular domain name, either by waiting for the registrant to forget to renew it or by logging into the domain registration system using stolen/compromised credentials. Zone transfer attacks, on the other hand, involve an improperly configured DNS server advertising its zone transfers publicly, which can leak sensitive information about domains.\n\nCentral ideas in this context include the distributed nature of the DNS system, the protocols used for zone transfers, and the potential security risks associated with these practices. Nuanced themes explored include the importance of proper DNS server configuration, the potential consequences of domain hijacking and zone transfer attacks, and the role of an attacker in exploiting these vulnerabilities.\n\nSignificant relationships within the context include the connection between domain hijacking and typosquatting, as well as the relationship between zone transfer attacks and the leaking of sensitive information about domains.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nImplicit assumptions in the context include the idea that domain registrants are responsible for renewing their domain names and that DNS server administrators are responsible for properly configuring their servers. Subtle details discussed include the use of stolen/compromised credentials to gain access to domain registration systems and the potential for attackers to use leaked information in the recon phase of an attack.\n\nUnderlying theories explored include the concept of distributed systems and the potential security risks associated with them.

A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

Hashes {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__hashes}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/hash.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"hash\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nA hashing algorithm is a one-way function that creates hashed text from plaintext. It is often used for data validation\n\nas a relatively small hash *digest* or *signature* can demonstrate the integrity of a large block of data. Hashes can\n\nalso be used so that sensitive information does not have to be stored in cleartext. By storing a hash of a password, you\n\ncan check to see if the correct password was entered without storing the password itself. In the case of a data breach\n\nonly the hashes are leaked and the attacker does not have access to the passwords to try with other services.\n\nTwo main families of hash algorithms are used: MD5 and SHA. MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value and is still often used to\n\nverify data integrity. The algorithm is technically cryptographically broken, but you may still see it in use. The SHA\n\nfamily of algorithms consists of SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [SHA-1: 160 bits, similar to MD5, designed by the NSA, no longer approved for cryptographic use]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-2: SHA-256 and SHA-512, very common with the number indicating the block size, designed by the NSA]{.principal}\n\n- [SHA-3: non-NSA designed, not widely adopted, similar numbering scheme as SHA-2 (SHA3-256, etc.)]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nDictionary based attacks against password hashes are fairly common. Typically software is used which generates a hash\n\nfor every word in the dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the compromised machine. One way to\n\ncombat this is through salting or adding random bits to each password. When salting the bits are stored with the hash.\n\nThis forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a\n\nstored table (rainbow table) of all the possible hashes. It can make attacks go from instant to days or even years\n\ndepending on the complexity of the password.\n\nAn even better way of combating attacks against hashes is through a secret salt or *pepper*. A pepper is a random value\n\nthat is added to the password but not stored with the resulting hash. The random value can be stored in a separate\n\nmedium such as a hardware Security Module.\n\n::::\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.6. Symmetric Encryption\"}\n",

A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

    "context": "## 6.7. Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Symmetric Encryption {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__symmetric_encryption}\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/symmetric.svg\" width=\"550\" alt=\"symmetric\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSymmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand in that it only uses a single key (in this case\n\nour key is labelled \\'A\\') to encrypt or decrypt data. Both parties need to know the private key in order to\n\ncommunicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages\n\ncan be decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other forms of encryption, it is often used for\n\nsecure communication or storage.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nOne-time-pad\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nOne-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The\n\ndifficulty in OTP mirrors the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared keys need to be exchanged\n\nat some point.\n\nImagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of\n\na copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The message they want to send is \\\"DIG UP\n\nTHE GOLD\\\". They turn to \\\"Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived\\\" and look up the first twelve letters in the chapter: MR AND\n\nMRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4\n\n(DIG UP THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13 18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND\n\nMRS DURS). Finally they add the two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.\n\nIf the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry\n\nPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the numbers in the ciphertext and\n\ndiscover the plaintext message. While theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the text as\n\nwell. This means that using common keys like popular books make it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the\n\nciphertext. After all, the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their cell.\n\nOTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables\n\nof random characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.7. Asymmetric Encryption\"}\n",

It stands for *Authentication*,\n\n*Authorization*, and *Accounting* and it is used in designing and implementing protocols. These concepts should be\n\nremembered when designing security plans.\n\nAuthentication is the process of confirming someone's identity. This may be done with user names and passwords or more\n\nfrequently via multi-factor authentication (MFA) which requires not only something you know, but something you have\n\n(fingerprints, key fob, etc.).\n\nAuthorization refers to keeping track of which resources an entity has access to. This can be done via a permission\n\nscheme or access control list (ACL). Occasionally you will encounter something more exotic where authorization limits\n\nusers to interactions during a particular time of day or from a particular IP address.\n\nAccounting refers to tracking the usage of resources. This may be as simple as noting in a log file when a user has\n\nlogged in to keeping track of exactly which services and user uses and how long they use them. Accounting is incredibly\n\nimportant because it allows you to not only monitor for possible problems, but also inspect what has occurred *after* a\n\nproblem is encountered.
