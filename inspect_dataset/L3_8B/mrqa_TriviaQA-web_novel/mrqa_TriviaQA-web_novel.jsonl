[PAR] In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, united by \u00c6thelstan (r. 927\u2013939), became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway.  The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.  [PAR] Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066\u20131154,  Plantagenet 1154\u20131485,  Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 (interrupted by the Interregnum of  1649\u20131660). [PAR] Dynastically, all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional, beginning with Henry II (reigned 1154-1189) as from that time, the Angevin kings became \"more English in nature\"; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I  of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor. [PAR] The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward\u00a0III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament.  From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558\u20131603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World. [PAR] From the accession of James I in 1603, the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the  execution of Charles I in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War  established  the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament, although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. [PAR] From this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom, with the reservation that it is \"uncodified\", is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689. On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.   [PAR] Name [PAR] The Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the Engle  or the Angelcynn, originally names of the Angles. They called their land Engla land, meaning \"land of the English\",  [PAR] by \u00c6thelweard Latinized Anglia, from an original Anglia vetus, the purported homeland of the Angles (called Angulus by Bede).  The name Engla land became England by haplology during the Middle English period (Engle-land, Engelond).  The Latin name was Anglia or Anglorum terra, the Old French and Anglo-Norman one Angleterre.  By the 14th century, England was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain. [PAR] The standard",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Greek alphabetThe Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BC. It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet,[http://www.arcalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Near-Eastern-Chronology-and-the-development-of-the-Greek-Alphabet.pdf The Development of the Greek Alphabet within the Chronology of the ANE] (2009), Quote: \"Naveh gives four major reasons why it is universally agreed that the Greek alphabet was developed from an early Phoenician alphabet.1 According to Herodutous \u201cthe Phoenicians who came with Cadmus... brought into Hellas the alphabet, which had hitherto been unknown, as I think, to the Greeks.\u201d2 The Greek Letters, alpha, beta, gimmel have no meaning in Greek but the meaning of most of their Semitic equivalents is known. For example, \u2018aleph\u2019 means \u2018ox\u2019, \u2018bet\u2019 means \u2018house\u2019 and \u2018gimmel\u2019 means \u2018throw stick\u2019.3 Early Greek letters are very similar and sometimes identical to the West Semitic letters.4 The letter sequence between the Semitic and Greek alphabets is identical. (Naveh 1982)\" and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. [PAR] In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era. [PAR] Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the 5th century BC and today. Modern and Ancient Greek use different diacritics. The traditional orthography, which is used for Ancient Greek and sometimes for Modern Greek, has many diacritics, such as accent marks for pitch accent (\"polytonic\"), the breathing marks for the presence and absence of the initial sound, and the iota subscript for the final historical sound. In standard Modern Greek spelling, orthography has been simplified to the monotonic system, which uses only two diacritics: the acute accent and diaeresis. [PAR] Letters  [PAR] Sound values  [PAR] In both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable. Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic. For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages.  [PAR] Among consonant letters, all letters that denoted voiced plosive consonants (/b, d, g/) and aspirated plosives (/p\u02b0, t\u02b0, k\u02b0/) in Ancient Greek stand for corresponding fricative sounds in Modern Greek. The correspondences are as follows: [PAR] Among the vowel symbols, Modern Greek sound values reflect the radical simplification of the vowel system of post-classical Greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into a much smaller number. This leads to several groups of vowel letters denoting identical sounds today. Modern Greek orthography remains true to the historical spellings in most of these cases. As a consequence, the spellings of words in Modern Greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable. [PAR] The following vowel letters and digraphs are involved in the mergers: [PAR] Modern Greek speakers typically use the same, modern, sound-symbol mappings in reading Greek of all historical stages. In other countries, students of Ancient Greek may use a variety of conventional approximations of the historical sound system in pronouncing Ancient Greek. [PAR] Digraphs and letter combinations  [PAR] Several letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components. Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized",

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for males, and this section will discuss the 4 main types of male voices, their respective pitch ranges, unique tonal characteristics, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One important point to note: These 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type \u2013 are not to be confused with each other. [PAR] The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that our voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas the Type of Voice refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to understand more about how to find your own vocal range, as well as how to determine your own voice type using the various criteria! [PAR] Now, the 4 main types of male voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Countertenor [PAR] Let us look at each of these male voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. COUNTERTENOR [PAR] The Countertenor Voice may actually be unfamiliar to those of us not from the classical realm, as many of us would probably only have heard of the 3 main male voices \u2013 Tenor, Baritone and Bass. [PAR] The Countertenor voice is the highest of the adult male voice types, and has a vocal range that is similar to that of the Female Contralto Voice, the lowest of the female voice types! In the Mandarin pop scene, certain singers like Jeff Chang and the lead singer of popular pop rock band Soda Green would probably qualify as countertenor voices! [PAR] An approximate Countertenor Vocal Range would be from a G note below the middle C (G3) to a high F one octave above the middle C (F5). Be sure to support your voice well with your breath so as to get a more accurate representation of the range in your voice. Check out the section on \u2018How to Find Your Singing Range and Voice Type\u2019 to get some tips on finding your range on your own! [PAR] Also, the Tessitura or most comfortable singing range for Countertenors lies above that of the Tenor and other adult male voices. The Countertenor voice would usually be able to sing the high head voice notes with great ease and brightness in tone, and would often be confused by many listeners with regular female voices. [PAR] 2. TENOR [PAR] The Tenor Voice is the highest of the main male vocal types that most people would be familiar with, with the typical tenor vocal range lying between the C note one octave below middle C (C3) to the C note one octave above middle C (C5)! This means that it would lie just slightly below the Countertenor voice, but has similar characteristics in the sense that the Tenor would also be able to sing most high notes with ease and vocalize the head voice notes with strength and brightness! [PAR] The Tenor voice would probably transition into his middle voice around the D or E note above middle C (D4 or E4) and shift into head voice around the F sharp or G above middle C (F4 or G4). The tenor tessitura would lie between that of the Countertenor\u2019s and the Baritone\u2019s. Do make sure that we avoid certain common singing problems like jaw tightness when we attempt to find out where our vocal register transitions lie, as this will affect the notes at which we transition, affecting the voice type we may classify ourselves to be! [PAR] Famous Tenor voices include the 3 Tenors \u2013 Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as well as other classical singers like Enrico Caruso and pop singers like Elton John, Stevie Wonder. In the Mandarin pop scene, JJ Lin Junjie and Jay Chou would probably be considered Tenor voices too! [PAR] 3. BARITONE [PAR] Most men would have a vocal range similar to that of a Baritone voice, as this is the most common of the male voice types!

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Musical theatreMusical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical\u00a0\u2013 humor, pathos, love, anger\u00a0\u2013 are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals. [PAR] Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America.  These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma! (1943).  Some of the most famous and iconic musicals through the decades that followed include [PAR] West Side Story (1957), The Fantasticks (1960), Hair (1967), A Chorus Line (1975), Les Mis\u00e9rables (1985), The Phantom of the Opera (1986), Rent (1996), The Producers (2001), Wicked (2003) and Hamilton (2015). [PAR] Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America. [PAR] Definitions and scope  [PAR] Book musicals [PAR] Since the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.   The three main components of a book musical are its music, lyrics and book. The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development, and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the libretto (Italian for \u201clittle book\u201d). The music and lyrics together form the score of a musical and includes songs; incidental music; and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\" The interpretation of a musical by is influenced by its creative team, which includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound, which generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some famous production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in Chicago. [PAR] There is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short intermission and the first act frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music, and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves",

The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture. [PAR] The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series, with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim burned off the episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.

In 2009, it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to The Simpsons. [PAR] Many tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy.

[PAR] Three of the most significant imaginary lines running across the surface of the Earth are the equator, the Tropic of Cancer, and the Tropic of Capricorn. While the equator is the longest line of latitude on the Earth (the line where the Earth is widest in an east-west direction), the tropics are based on the sun's position in relation to the Earth at two points of the year. All three lines of latitude are significant in their relationship between the Earth and the sun. [PAR] The Equator [PAR] The equator is located at zero degrees latitude . The equator runs through Indonesia, Ecuador, northern Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Kenya, among other countries . It is 24,901.55 miles (40,075.16 kilometers) long. On the equator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes - near March and September 21. The equator divides the planet into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. On the equator, the length of day and night are equal every day of the year - day is always twelve hours long and night is always twelve hours long. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Overview of the Four Seasons [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and The Tropic of Capricorn [PAR] The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn each lie at 23.5 degrees latitude. The Tropic of Cancer is located at 23.5\u00b0 North of the equator and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia , India, and southern China. The Tropic of Capricorn lies at 23.5\u00b0 South of the equator and runs through Australia, Chile, southern Brazil (Brazil is the only country that passes through both the equator and a tropic), and northern South Africa . [PAR] The tropics are the two lines where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two solstices - near June and December 21. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 (the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) and the sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21 (the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere). [PAR] The reason for the location of the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5\u00b0 north and south respectively is due to the axial tilt of the Earth. The Earth is titled 23.5 degrees from the plane of the Earth's revolution around the sun each year. [PAR] The area bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and Tropic of Capricorn on the south is known as the \"tropics.\" This area does not experience seasons because the sun is always high in the sky. Only higher latitudes, north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, experience significant seasonal variation in climate. Realize, however, that areas in the tropics can be cold. The peak of Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii stands nearly 14,000 feet above sea level, and snow is not unusual. [PAR] If you live north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the sun will\u00a0never\u00a0be directly overhead. In the United States, for example, Hawaii is the only location in the country that is south of the Tropic of Cancer, and it is thus the only location in the United States where the sun will be directly overhead in the summer.. [PAR] Prime Meridian [PAR] While the equator divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemispheres , it is the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude and the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian (near the International Date Line ) at 180 degrees longitude that divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres . The Eastern Hemisphere consists of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia while the Western Hemisphere includes North and South America .

The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.\u00a0 Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.\u00a0 The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.\u00a0 The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley\" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.\u00a0 He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real. But he did have fun playing in the clouds. He made Sir Basil suffer when he shot his tail off, as he pretended to be dead. Poor Sir Basil didn't know what to do, so as usual shouted for Lady Rosemary, who saw Parsley was faking it. His best friend is Dill the dog and both of them seem to get themselves into trouble. But once in a while Parsley does come up with a good idea, such as the time he persuaded Pashana Bedhi to use his snake charming skills to float Sage and his nest back in the tree. \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley with a tail for doing jobs of every kind but I mustn't treat it roughly or too harshly for it's such a useful thing to have behind\" His songs are: \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I am always very glad to see you wave but please don't shout or speak to me too harshly because I'm not particularly brave\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I really don't like climbing things at all so please don't shout or speak to me too harshly I am sure you wouldn't want to see me fall\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I'm supposed to pull this rope and ring the bell though I try to pull it gently never harshly I'm afraid that I'm not doing very well\" \"For today I",

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for females, and this section will discuss about the 3 main types of female voices, their respective note ranges, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One point to note: There is a difference between the 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type; The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that the voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas Voice Type refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to learn how to find the full range of your voice, as well as understand more about the various voice classification criteria and learn how to determine your own voice type! [PAR] Now, the 3 main types of female voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Soprano [PAR] Let us look at each of these voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. SOPRANO [PAR] As many of us would know, the Soprano voice is the highest of the female voices, and many of us would be familiar with this voice type. I am sure many ladies out there would be envious of their Soprano friends who seem to be able to hit the high notes with such ease! [PAR] A typical Soprano vocal range would probably be from the A note below middle C (A3) to the F or G note 2 octaves above (F6 or G6), making it a range of 2 plus to 3 octaves. Of course, this is not to be taken as an exact measurement but more as a rough guideline for soprano voices, and proper breath support must be used when measuring vocal ranges during singing. [PAR] The Soprano Tessitura is also usually higher than the other female voice types, considering that the overall vocal range is the highest among the female voices. [PAR] A Soprano would also probably transition out of her chest voice around the E flat note above middle C (E4) and shift into her head voice around the F sharp note one octave above the middle C (F5). [PAR] The soprano voice usually has a bright tone, and she would usually have a strong head voice, but a relatively weaker middle voice. Sopranos are also able to sing more high notes and sustain at a high pitch better than a mezzo soprano can, and they are also most often the lead role for operas or shows. [PAR] 2. MEZZO SOPRANO [PAR] For most ladies out there, you would probably belong to this voice type as the Mezzo Soprano voice is the most common female voice type out of the 3 main types, and it lies between the higher Soprano voice and the lower Contralto voice. [PAR] The vocal range for the Mezzo Soprano voice would be likely between the G note below middle C (G3) to the C note more than 2 octaves above (C6), making it also a range of around slightly",

The character was played by Donald Sutherland in the film and Alan Alda on television. [PAR] Contents [PAR] Edit [PAR] Born and raised in Crabapple Cove, Maine , Hawkeye is (according to the TV series) the son of Dr. Daniel Pierce. According to the novels, his father is \u201cBig Benjy\u201d Pierce, a lobster fisherman. He attended Androscoggin College, where he played football and intercepted a Hail Mary pass thrown by Dartmouth quarterback John McIntyre . After his medical residency in Boston, Hawkeye is drafted into the U. S. Army and called to serve at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) during the Korean War. Between long, intense sessions of treating critically wounded patients, he makes the best of his life in an isolated Army camp with heavy drinking, carousing, and pulling pranks on the people around him, especially the unpleasantly stiff and callous Major Frank Burns and Major Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan. [PAR] Origin of the nickname \u201cHawkeye\u201d [PAR] Edit [PAR] The novel established that Pierce's nickname of \"Hawkeye\" was given to him by his father. It comes from the novel The Last of the Mohicans, which Pierce, in Hooker's book, claimed was \"The only book my old man ever read.\"[1] [PAR] In an episode of the TV series in which Hawkeye believed himself to be in mortal danger due to heavy enemy shelling, he made out a will and left Colonel Sherman T. Potter (who Hawkeye stated was like a father) the edition of The Last of the Mohicans that his father had given him. \"It was his favorite book,\" Hawkeye wrote in the will, implying that he had read more books. [PAR] Changes in the character [PAR] Edit [PAR] Although the Robert Altman film followed Hooker's book somewhat in structure, much of the dialogue was improvised and thus departed even from Ring Lardner, Jr.'s screenplay. The screenplay itself departed from the book in a number of details (e.g. Frank Burns became a major instead of a captain, and was identified with Major Hobson, the zealously religious officer that Pierce and bunk mate Trapper John McIntyre got removed from their tent and, subsequently, the camp), but on the whole, the main characters and mood were left intact. [PAR] Perhaps the biggest change in Hawkeye's characterization from the book, to the big screen and finally to the small screen comes in his marital status. The Hawkeye of the book is married to Evelyn Pierce with children (according to the sequels) and faithful while in Korea (as far as the reader is concerned). He offers several doctors love advice, \"Jeeter\" Carroll for example, extolling the virtues of extramarital sex but never partaking himself. The film version of Hawkeye is still married, but gives himself more moral leeway, arguing that he is far from home, no one is ever going to know, and it will reduce stress for both involved.

[PAR] Bureau of Reclamation [PAR] Grand  Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River west of Spokane, Washington, is one of the  largest structures ever built by mankind--a mass of concrete standing 550 feet  high and 5,223 feet long, or just shy of a mile. Grand Coulee contains 12 million cubic yards  of concrete, or enough to build a highway from Seattle to Miami. More massive than the Great Pyramid of Giza, Grand  Coulee is listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the seven  civil engineering wonders of the United States. Grand Coulee's reservoir,  Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, stretches 150  miles north, almost to the Canadian border. [PAR] A concrete gravity dam, Grand Coulee took  eight years to build, employed thousands of men during the Great Depression and,  when completed in 1942, provided the enormous electrical power necessary to  make aluminum, so essential for World War II production of planes and ships. It was  Grand Coulee, as well, that powered the production of plutonium at the nearby  Hanford Site, which figured prominently in the making of the atomic bomb. [PAR] So  grand was Grand Coulee Dam that in 1941 folk singer Woody Guthrie wrote \u201cThe  Song of the Grand Coulee Dam\u201d (though he was paid to do so under contract with  the Bonneville Power Administration.) \u201cBiggest  thing built by the hand of a Man,\u201d Guthrie sang. \u201cPower that sings, boys, turbines that whine.  Waters back up the Canadian Line.\u201d [PAR] Appropriate  as the word grand is for the dam, the  name Grand Coulee actually refers to a  unique geological feature created thousands of years ago when Ice Age glaciers  blocked the ancient riverbed of the Columbia River. When water eventually traveled under the ice  dam, great floods scoured out hundreds of miles of deep gulches, or coulees, in  the Columbia River Basin. One of these, the Grand  Coulee, is four miles wide and bordered on three sides by steep cliffs. [PAR] A local  proposal to dam the Columbia at the head of the Grand Coulee dated to 1918, but  the idea faced strong competition from another proposal that called for an  irrigation canal to be built from the Pend Oreille River in northern Idaho. Proponents of this latter \u201cgravity plan\u201d argued that the hydroelectricity generated from the dam was not needed. Many studies followed, including one by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, which took Grand Coulee\u2019s side, recommending a high dam  at the site and the pumping of irrigation water up to the surrounding  countryside. [PAR] This recommendation took hold with the Bureau  of Reclamation, which was promoting construction of multiple-use dams, through  which the production of hydroelectric power could produce revenue to help repay the construction cost of a project. (The Reclamation Act requires that beneficiaries of a project repay those costs, and a multi-purpose project reduced the payment burden on irrigators.) The recommendation found  traction with the 1932 election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in a  time of great dust bowls and economic depression. Roosevelt launched federal program after  federal program in an attempt to spur the economy by \u201cpriming the pump\u201d and  providing jobs for out-of-work Americans.  Unprecedented funds flowed to the Bureau of Reclamation as it became a  key player in the New Deal\u2019s Public Works Administration (PWA), which spent \u201cbig bucks on big projects,\u201d Grand Coulee Dam among them.

In 1841, Egor bought freedom for himself and his family at the price of 875 rubles. [PAR] Russia had been changing ever since the early 18th century, when Tsar Peter the Great carried out a series of reforms with the intent of modernizing Russia in Western Europe's image. European styles in fashion and art were imported, the Western canon was widely read among the nobility, and French was adopted as the language of cultured discourse. A large government bureaucracy was created; the achievement of rank became an obsession of Russian life. During Chekhov's childhood, in the time of Tsar Alexander II, a second wave of reforms was underway, reforms that further liberalized the country and its economy. The most important of these was the Emancipation Declaration of 1861, which freed the serfs from bondage. These reforms caused great controversy, as they introduced what was, in effect, the beginning of a free-market economy, undermining the power of the nobility, and sometimes even impoverishing them. The situation displayed in The Cherry Orchard, of a wealthy landowning family forced to sell their estate in order to pay their debts, was thus a familiar one in the Russian society of Chekhov's day. [PAR] Chekhov himself had a relatively quiet childhood. He attended the local Russian grammar school, worked in his father's store and occasionally wrote small pieces for the amusement of his family. Taganrog was not a typical provincial town; it was a multicultural port, with Italians, Greeks, and Turks residing in the wealthier sections of town and Russians such as the Chekhovs living in comparatively poor suburbs. It had a theater, which the young Chekhov would often visit. When Chekhov was sixteen, Pavel's store failed, and the entire family had to move to Moscow\u2014the entire family, that is, except for Anton. A merchant (and friend of the family) had helped the Chekhovs with a loan, but insisted on keeping Anton with him in the house as a kind of collateral. As soon as he could, he left Taganrog in order to pursue medical studies in Moscow in 1879 at the age of 19. [PAR] That year, Chekhov began to write comic stories in order to pay his medical school tuition. By the time he was twenty, he was employed by The Spectator magazine as their regular humorist. Over ninety percent of Chekhov's published work appeared in magazines before he was twenty-eight, and, by this age, he had already established himself as a premier writer of short stories. As he developed as a writer, his stories began to take on deeper and more profound themes, as he moved away from his comic roots. [PAR] To this day, Chekhov's literary reputation primarily rests with his short stories, and Chekhov's early plays, written primarily in his early 20s, are not well-remembered. It was only in 1896 that he began to turn his attention back to drama; in the eight remaining years before his death, he managed to complete four plays: The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, The Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard. [PAR] The first performance of The Seagull was nearly laughed off the stage; it was criticized as dull, unimaginative, and lacking any sort of dramatic tension (a critical undercurrent that has survived in Russia to this day). Only gradually did Chekhov's new form of drama, emphasizing characterization, detail and symbolism instead of plot development and incident, gain acceptance. Chekhov was the in-house playwright for the Moscow Arts Theatre, which had been founded by his friend Vladimir Nemirovich-Davchenko. During this time, he fell in love with one of the",

The show is set in a bar named Cheers (named after its real life counterpart) in Boston, Massachusetts, where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize.  The show's main theme song, written and performed by Gary Portnoy, and co-written with Judy Hart Angelo, lent its famous refrain \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" as the show's tagline.

Cheers, however, eventually became a highly rated television show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at number one. The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night \"Must See TV\" lineup. Its widely watched series finale was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 270 episodes have been successfully syndicated worldwide.  Nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series for all eleven of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations.

Their coalition was re-elected by a landslide following the Armistice.  Law persuaded the Conservatives to end the coalition, and work as an independent party. Conservative withdrawal forced Lloyd George to resign. The King then invited Law to form a new administration in 1922. Law's 'Tranquility Manifesto' was an attempt to allow Britain to recover from war damage. Though elected, he lasted just 209 days in office. He resigned in May 1923 due to ill health. [PAR] Stanley Baldwin, Conservative Prime Minister from 1923, 1924-9, 1935-7, played a leading part in a Conservative rebellion which overthrew the coalition government and the premiership of Lloyd George. In Bonar Law's Conservative government he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. When Bonar Law retired through illness in May 1923, Baldwin became prime minister. Determined to help reduce unemployment, in November he called a general election to seek support for a policy of trade protection. Failing to retain a majority, his government resigned in January 1924. Its replacement, the first Labour government also lacked an overall majority, and after it was defeated in another general election in October 1924, Baldwin returned as prime minister. [PAR] James Ramsay MacDonald, Labour Prime Minister from 1924 and 1929-35, became chairman of the parliamentary Labour group in 1911. As the Labour Party grew, however, he was criticised as being too moderate. His opposition to the Great War made him more unpopular still. In 1924 was asked by George V to form a government when Stanley Baldwin's small Conservative majority proved ungovernable. In his second minority government in 1929, the economic crises, including the doubling of unemployment levels, persuaded him to include the opposition leaders in a cross-party National Government. [PAR] During the 1931 financial and political crisis, Baldwin contributed to the formation of a 'National' coalition government, led by the former Labour prime minister, MacDonald. As Lord President of the Council, Baldwin at first sought to promote international disarmament, warning of the difficulty of defence against air attack: 'the bomber will always get through'. But as the threat from Nazi Germany became obvious, he accepted the need for rearmament and introduced new defence programmes each year from 1934 to 1937, against Labour and Liberal opposition. [PAR] Baldwin became prime minister of the National government in June 1935. In the autumn he won a general election, promising to continue to strengthen national defences. When seeking to avoid war with Mussolini's Italy over Abyssinia in order to focus effort against Hitler's Germany, his Cabinet was embarrassed by premature disclosure of a compromise settlement ('the Hore-Laval pact'). In retrospect the National Government's policy of combining armed deterrence with efforts to bind Hitler and Mussolini into a general European settlement seemed insufficient, and after the Second World War broke out in 1939 Baldwin became a leading target for those - especially Churchill - who thought more could have been done to accelerate rearmament and prevent war. [PAR] Neville Chamberlain, Conservative Prime Minister from 1937-40,  succeeded Baldwin as Prime Minister in May 1937. War was brewing in Europe, and had already exploded in Spain. Chamberlain was unwilling to go down in history as responsible for an inevitably destructive war without doing everything possible to prevent it. Neville Chamberlain, as with many in Europe who had witnessed the horrors of the First World War and its aftermath, was committed to peace at almost any price. Chamberlain famously met German chancellor Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938 the result of which was an agreement that Britain and Germany would never again go to war. \"I believe,\" he declared on his return to the UK, \"it is peace for our time.\" However, the success of 'appeasement' was shortlived, as Hitler occupied Prague the following year.

The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. [PAR] The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978\u201392). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958\u201366), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967\u201392). [PAR] Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u201362) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u201374). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. [PAR] All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. [PAR] Background [PAR] \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". [PAR] The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.) [PAR] The stock-in-trade of Carry On humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (Nurse, Doctor, Again Doctor, Matron), the monarchy (Henry), the Empire (Up the Khyber), the armed forces (Sergeant) and the trade unions (At Your Convenience) as well as the Hammer horror film (Screaming), camping (Camping), foreigners (Abroad), beauty contests (Girls), and caravan holidays (Behind) among others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they proved very popular with audiences.

Celebrated annually on 26 January, it marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet of British Ships at Port Jackson, New South Wales, and the raising of the Flag of Great Britain at Sydney Cove by Governor Arthur Phillip. In present-day Australia, celebrations reflect the diverse society and landscape of the nation, and are marked by community and family events, reflections on Australian history, official community awards, and citizenship ceremonies welcoming new immigrants into the Australian community.  [PAR] The meaning and significance of Australia Day has evolved over time. Unofficially, or historically, the date has also been variously named \"Anniversary Day\", \"Foundation Day\", and \"ANA Day\".  26 January 1788 marked the proclamation of British sovereignty over the eastern seaboard of Australia (then known as New Holland).  Although it was not known as Australia Day until over a century later, records of celebrations on 26 January date back to 1808, with the first official celebration of the formation of New South Wales held in 1818.  On New Year's Day 1901, the British colonies of Australia formed a Federation, marking the birth of modern Australia. A national day of unity and celebration was looked for. It was not until 1935 that all Australian states and territories had adopted use of the term \"Australia Day\" to mark the date, and not until 1994 that the date was consistently marked by a public holiday on that day by all states and territories.  [PAR] In contemporary Australia, the holiday is marked by the presentation of the Australian of the Year Awards on Australia Day Eve, announcement of the Australia Day Honours list and addresses from the Governor-General and Prime Minister. It is an official public holiday in every state and territory of Australia, unless it falls on a weekend in which case the following Monday becomes a public holiday instead. With community festivals, concerts and citizenship ceremonies, the day is celebrated in large and small communities and cities around the nation. Australia Day has become the biggest annual civic event in Australia. [PAR] Some Indigenous Australian events are now included.  However, since at least 1938 Australia Day has also been marked by Indigenous Australians protesting the invasion of their land by Europeans and its celebration as a national holiday.  They prefer to call it \"Invasion Day\" or \"Survival Day\" and advocate that, alternatively, the date should be changed.  [PAR] History [PAR] Arrival of the First Fleet [PAR] On 13 May 1787 a fleet of 11 ships, which came to be known as the First Fleet, was sent by the British Admiralty from England to Australia. Under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, the fleet sought to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay on the coast of New South Wales, which had been explored and claimed by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. The settlement was seen as necessary because of the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America.  The Fleet arrived between 18 and 20 January 1788, but it was immediately apparent that Botany Bay was unsuitable. [PAR] On 21 January, Phillip and a few officers travelled to Port Jackson, 12 km to the north, to see if it would be a better location for a settlement. They stayed there until 23 January; Phillip named the site of their landing Sydney Cove, after the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. They also made contact with the local Aboriginal people. [PAR] They returned to Botany Bay on the evening of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Theodore RooseveltTheodore  Roosevelt Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858 \u2013 January 6, 1919) was an American statesman, author, explorer, soldier, naturalist, and reformer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. [PAR] Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College. His first of many books, The Naval War of 1812 (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the American West and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders, where he gained national fame for courage during the Spanish\u2013American War. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president as McKinley's running mate in the election of 1900. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley's re-election in a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism. [PAR] Following the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, succeeded to the office, becoming the youngest United States President in history. Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era, he championed his \"Square Deal\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Making conservation a top priority, he established a myriad of new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. [PAR] Elected in 1904 to a full term, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, William Howard Taft, to succeed him in the presidency. After leaving office, Roosevelt went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor. He tried but failed to win the presidential nomination in 1912. Roosevelt founded his own party, the Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split among Republicans enabled the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in 1912. The Democrats in the South had also gained power by having disenfranchised most blacks (and Republicans) from the political system from 1890 to 1908, fatally weakening the Republican Party across the region, and creating a Solid South dominated by their party alone. Republicans aligned with Taft nationally would control the Republican Party for decades. [PAR] Frustrated at home, Roosevelt led a two-year expedition in the Amazon Basin, nearly dying of tropical disease. During World War I, he opposed President Woodrow Wilson for keeping the U.S. out of the war against Germany, and offered his military services, which were never summoned. Although planning to run again for president in 1920, Roosevelt suffered deteriorating health and died in early 1919.",

The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and non-magical people (Muggles). [PAR] Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 30 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.  The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. , the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release. [PAR] The series was originally published in English by two major publishers, Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. A play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, based on a story by Rowling, premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre, and its script was published by Little, Brown as the eighth book in the series.  The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which has become the second highest-grossing film series of all time . The franchise has also generated much tie-in merchandise, making the Harry Potter brand worth in excess of $15\u00a0billion.  [PAR] A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death.  Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness. [PAR] The success of the books and films has ensured that the Harry Potter franchise continues to expand, with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premi\u00e8red in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a trilogy of spin-off films premi\u00e8ring in November 2016, among many other developments. Most recently, themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The central character in the series is Harry Potter, an English orphan who discovers, at the age of eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles.  The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation, that lies ahead, in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.

Together they had ten illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname FitzClarence. [PAR] Early life [PAR] She was born Dorothea (sometimes called Dorothy or Dora) Bland near Waterford, Ireland, the daughter of Francis Bland (d. 1778) and his mistress, Grace Phillips. She was the paternal granddaughter of Nathaneal Bland (d. 1760), Vicar General of Ardfert and Aghada, and Judge of the Prerogative Court of Dublin, Ireland, and his wife Lucy (n\u00e9e Heaton). [PAR] In 1774, when she was 13, Dorothea's father, who worked as a stagehand, abandoned the family to marry an Irish actress. Though he continued to support the family by sending them meagre sums of money, they were poor and Dorothea had to go to work to help support her four siblings. Her mother, an actress by profession, saw potential in Dorothea and put her on the stage. [PAR] Stage life and early relationships [PAR] She became a famous actress of the day and was said to have the most beautiful legs ever seen on the stage. Audiences enjoyed her performances in breeches roles. She assumed the name \"Mrs. Jordan\", because it was slightly more respectable for a married woman to be on the stage. In fact, there was no \"Mr. Jordan\" and Dorothea Bland never married. Some sources state that the name and title were taken to conceal an early pregnancy. She had an affair with her first boss, Richard Daly, the manager of the Theatre Royal, Cork, who was married, and had an illegitimate daughter, Frances (b. 1782 Dublin), at age 20. [PAR] In England, she had a short lived affair with an army Lieutenant, Charles Doyne, who proposed marriage. But she turned him down and went to work for the theatre company operated by Tate Wilkinson. It was at this point she adopted the name \"Mrs. Jordan\" \u2013 a reference to her escape across the Irish Sea, likened to the River Jordan. [PAR] Shortly after her affair with Wilkinson was over, she began an affair with George Inchbald, the male lead in the Wilkinson company. According to Claire Tomalin, Dorothea's biographer, Dorothea would have married Inchbald, so greatly was she in love with him, but that he never asked. Broken-hearted, she left him in 1786 to begin an affair with Sir Richard Ford, a police magistrate and a lawyer. She moved in with Ford when he promised to marry her.

He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon\u2019s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 1799, during Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt, a French soldier named Pierre Francois Bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the Rosetta Stone. This artifact provided the key to cracking the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years. [PAR] As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. [PAR] In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. [PAR] In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general. [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Rise to Power [PAR] Since 1792, France\u2019s revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various European nations. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria, one of his country\u2019s primary rivals, in a series of battles in Italy. In 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French. [PAR] The following year, the Directory, the five-person group that had governed France since 1795, offered to let Napoleon lead an invasion of England. Napoleon determined that France\u2019s naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior British Royal Navy. Instead, he proposed an invasion of Egypt in an effort to wipe out British trade routes with India. Napoleon\u2019s troops scored a victory against Egypt\u2019s military rulers, the Mamluks, at the Battle of the Pyramids in July 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the British at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. In early 1799, Napoleon\u2019s army launched an invasion of Ottoman-ruled Syria, which ended with the failed siege of Acre, located in modern-day Israel. That summer, with the political situation in France marked by uncertainty, the ever-ambitious and cunning Napoleon opted to abandon his army in Egypt and return to France.

Whether Lydgate and Barnes coined any of these terms, or whether they were setting down the terms that were considered proper in their day is not known.  Many of the terms did catch on, and the lists they appeared on were frequently reprinted. [PAR] The best source I know for investigating the histories of English words is  the Oxford English Dictionary.  Unfortunately, on the question whether  these terms ever were or still are appropriate, the OED is not entirely  helpful.  To make sense of the matter, I have placed the group names into  groups-- [PAR] GROUP A--The following group names are standard:  A bevy of quail  A bouquet of pheasants   A brood of hens  A cast of hawks  A charm of finches  A covey of partridges  A flight of swallows  A gaggle of geese  A nye of pheasants  A siege of herons  A skein of geese  A trip of dotterel  A wisp of snipe  GROUP B--These terms are not group names for a particular type of bird, but have been commonly used for many different types:   Colony  Company  Flock  Parliament  Party  GROUP C--These terms are archaic; they were once obsolete, but they have  been revived somewhat in the 19th or 20th centuries:  A building of rooks  A murmuration of starlings  A muster of peacocks  A peep of chickens  A sord of mallards  A spring of teal  A watch of nightingales  GROUP D--These terms are obsolete; they appeared on the old lists, but almost nobody has used them in centuries:   A",

It is presented by Nick Hewer, assisted by Rachel Riley, with regular lexicographer Susie Dent. It was the first programme to be aired on Channel 4, and 73 series have been broadcast since its debut on 2 November 1982. With over 6,000 episodes, Countdown is one of the longest-running game shows in the world, along with the original French version, Des chiffres et des lettres (Numbers & Letters), which has been running on French television continuously since 1965. Countdown was initially recorded at The Leeds Studios for 27 years, before moving to Granada Studios in 2009, and then over to MediaCityUK in Salford Quays in 2013. [PAR] The programme was presented by Richard Whiteley for over 20 years, until his sudden death in June 2005. It was then presented by Des Lynam until the end of 2006, Des O'Connor until the end of 2008, and Jeff Stelling until the end of 2011; Nick Hewer has presented the show since 2012. Carol Vorderman, the show's co-host, who had also been on the programme since it began, left the show in December 2008, at the same time as Des O'Connor. She was replaced by Rachel Riley. Cathy Hytner originally placed letters on the board for the letters games before this was taken over by Vorderman. [PAR] A celebrity guest features in every programme, and provides a brief interlude midway between the two advertisement breaks. The two contestants in each episode compete in three disciplines: ten letters rounds, in which the contestants attempt to make the longest word possible from nine randomly chosen letters; four numbers rounds, in which the contestants must use arithmetic to reach a random target number from six other numbers; and the conundrum, a buzzer round in which the contestants compete to solve a nine-letter anagram. During the series heats, the winning contestant returns the next day until he or she loses or has accumulated eight wins (known as an Octochamp). The best eight contestants are invited back for the series finals, which are decided in knockout format. Contestants of exceptional skill have received national media coverage, and the programme as a whole is widely recognised and parodied within British culture. [PAR] History [PAR] Origin [PAR] Countdown is based on the French game show Des chiffres et des lettres (Numbers and Letters), created by Armand Jammot. The format was brought to Britain by Marcel Stellman, a Belgian record executive, who had watched the French show and believed it could be popular overseas. Yorkshire Television purchased the format and commissioned a series of eight shows under the title Calendar Countdown, which were to be a spin-off of their regional news programme Calendar. As the presenter of Calendar, Richard Whiteley was the natural choice to present Calendar Countdown\u2014his daily appearances on both shows earned him the nickname \"Twice Nightly\".  These shows were only broadcast in the Yorkshire area.  [PAR] An additional pilot episode was made, with a refined format, although it was never broadcast.  A new British television channel, Channel 4, was due to launch in November 1982, and bought the newly renamed Countdown on the strength of this additional episode. Countdown was the first programme to be broadcast on the new channel.

[PAR] Junior Countdown [PAR] Channel 4 originally planned a parallel Junior Countdown in which the contestants were children. The pilot episode was filmed on 26 November 1982, less than a month after the first adult version was broadcast.  The presenter was Gyles Brandreth, with Ted Moult in Dictionary Corner. The format mirrored that of the adult version. No further episodes were filmed, and the pilot episode was never broadcast. Brandreth, speaking on Countdown in November 2012, stated that the concept had proved disastrous, and was abandoned.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Theodore RooseveltTheodore  Roosevelt Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858 \u2013 January 6, 1919) was an American statesman, author, explorer, soldier, naturalist, and reformer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. [PAR] Born a sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt successfully overcame his health problems by embracing a strenuous lifestyle. He integrated his exuberant personality, vast range of interests, and world-famous achievements into a \"cowboy\" persona defined by robust masculinity. Home-schooled, he became a lifelong naturalist before attending Harvard College. His first of many books, The Naval War of 1812 (1882), established his reputation as both a learned historian and as a popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in New York's state legislature. Following the deaths of his wife and mother, he took time to grieve by escaping to the wilderness of the American West and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas for a time, before returning East to run unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City in 1886. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under William McKinley, resigning after one year to serve with the Rough Riders, where he gained national fame for courage during the Spanish\u2013American War. Returning a war hero, he was elected governor of New York in 1898. The state party leadership distrusted him, so they took the lead in moving him to the prestigious but powerless role of vice president as McKinley's running mate in the election of 1900. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously across the country, helping McKinley's re-election in a landslide victory based on a platform of peace, prosperity, and conservatism. [PAR] Following the assassination of President McKinley in September 1901, Roosevelt, at age 42, succeeded to the office, becoming the youngest United States President in history. Leading his party and country into the Progressive Era, he championed his \"Square Deal\" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. Making conservation a top priority, he established a myriad of new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He greatly expanded the United States Navy, and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States' naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. [PAR] Elected in 1904 to a full term, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive policies, but many of his efforts and much of his legislative agenda were eventually blocked in Congress. Roosevelt successfully groomed his close friend, William Howard Taft, to succeed him in the presidency. After leaving office, Roosevelt went on safari in Africa and toured Europe. Returning to the USA, he became frustrated with Taft's approach as his successor. He tried but failed to win the presidential nomination in 1912. Roosevelt founded his own party, the Progressive, so-called \"Bull Moose\" Party, and called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split among Republicans enabled the Democrats to win both the White House and a majority in the Congress in 1912. The Democrats in the South had also gained power by having disenfranchised most blacks (and Republicans) from the political system from 1890 to 1908, fatally weakening the Republican Party across the region, and creating a Solid South dominated by their party alone. Republicans aligned with Taft nationally would control the Republican Party for decades. [PAR] Frustrated at home, Roosevelt led a two-year expedition in the Amazon Basin, nearly dying of tropical disease. During World War I, he opposed President Woodrow Wilson for keeping the U.S. out of the war against Germany, and offered his military services, which were never summoned. Although planning to run again for president in 1920, Roosevelt suffered deteriorating health and died in early 1919.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Marilyn MonroeMarilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926\u00a0\u2013 August 5, 1962) was an American actress and model. Famous for playing \"dumb blonde\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962.  She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon. [PAR] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946\u201347) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films. [PAR] By 1953, Monroe was one of the most bankable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the noir Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, The Seven Year Itch (1955). When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961). [PAR] Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to baseball player Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, which both ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles on August 5, 1962. Although the death was ruled a probable suicide, several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death. [PAR] Life and career [PAR] Childhood and first marriage (1926\u201344) [PAR] Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384). Gladys, the daughter of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper and worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult. Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928. The identity",

Learn all about the Greek Mythology of Achilles. [PAR] slide 1 of 6 [PAR] Hear the name Achilles and most people will think of Brad Pitt, the Trojan War, or someone's weakness, a.k.a. an \"Achilles Heel.\" However, not everyone knows how his story fits into Greek Mythology. While it's counterintuitive to deem anything associated with mythology a fact, this study guide reviews most of the important facts about Achilles in Greek Mythology. [PAR] Like many figures in Greek Mythology , Achilles story begins before he is even born. Achilles mother was a sea-nymph named Thetis whose beauty tempted the ever-philandering god Zeus. Having been warned by Prometheus that he would be dethroned by a child born to him and Thetis, Zeus forced Thetis to marry a mortal in order to remove the temptation. [PAR] slide 2 of 6 [PAR] Saved From Evil Fate [PAR] Thetis and her husband, Peleus, had six children before Achilles. The first six were thrown into fire by their mother in an effort to burn out their mortality. The seventh child was saved from this fate by his father and eventually Thetis accepted the child and grew to love him. She called him Achilles and, wanting to protect him from his human frailty, took him to the River Styx which was believed to convey immortality. Thetis held him by his heel and submerged the infant Achilles. All but the heel she held were suffused with inordinate strength, hence, Achilles heel. [PAR] \u00a0 Achilles was educated by Chiron, a centaur who lived on Mt. Pelion and was revered for his wisdom. Achilles grew strong, handsome, and well versed in the strategies of war and peace. When the call came for Greece's greatest warriors to amass and avenge the taking of Melenaus's wife, Helen, by the Trojan Prince Paris, a fretful Thetis rushed her son off to the island of Skyros disguised as a girl. While hiding on Skyros, Achilles fathers a son with the king's daughter Deidameia. [PAR] Eventually, Achilles whereabouts became unveiled and Odysseus weeded him out with a cunning ploy; he sent gifts of jewelry and trinkets to the women's lodgings that included armor and a sword. News of young woman practicing with the weapons brought emissaries to insist Achilles join the war. [PAR] slide 3 of 6 [PAR] The Trojan War [PAR] The Iliad by Homer tells only a fraction of the story of the war. The war lasted nine years, while Homer's epic recounts events from only the last year. Achilles's tale begins much earlier when he joins the fleet of Greek warriors setting sail for the Trojan shores as commander of a feared force known as the Myrmidons of Thessaly. For much of the war, Achilles is at odds with Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and supreme commander of all the Greek forces. The heart of the dispute, just like that of the war itself, is a woman. During the course of the long war Briseis, a Trojan woman, was taken as booty and given to Achilles as a concubine and he cherished her for her beauty. [PAR] Similarly, Agamemnon's mistress Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, was taken in one of the cities of the Troad. After refusing a ransom demand from Chryseis's father, Apollo inflicted Agamemnon's troops with a plague. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon to appease the god by returning the girl; he capitulated but his price was Briseis. An enraged Achilles conceded, as it was the supreme commander's right, but audibly vowed the Myrmidons would no longer fight for Agamemnon. [PAR] slide 4 of 6 [PAR] Immortal Interference [PAR] Achilles recruited the aid of his mother who, in turn, went to Zeus. He caused Agamemnon to dream of victory by aggressively moving his army forward. Agamemnon tried this and was met by Hector, the brother of Paris. A fight between Paris and Menelaus was suggested. The two faced each other in the",

Please visit our online store and go shopping at the number one imported food delivery service in the USA. England has a rich cheese making history. English cheese is known for its slow aged, intense flavors made from traditional recipes handed down through the generations.  While cheese has been produced in England for thousands of years, today England produces hundreds of varieties of cheeses.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar and Blue Stilton, England's first and second most famous cheeses, have both been given PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) status which establishes traditional methods for its production.  English PDO Cheeses must be made with local ingredients within certain geographical locations related to the specific cheese.  PDO protection helps ensure that an English Cheese like Farmhouse Cheddar or Blue Stilton does not stray from original recipes and continues England's time tested cheesemaking traditions. England continues to create new and unique cheese blends such as Cotswold (Double Gloucester with Onions and Chives) and the best-selling English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions. [PAR] Types of English Cheese: [PAR] Cheddar: Cheddar cheese originated the 1100s, perhaps earlier, in the village of Cheddar in southwestern England near the geological feature called Cheddar Gorge. Cheddar Gorge is a series of caves that naturally maintain the ideal conditions (humidity, temperature, etc.) for cheese ripening. In the 1800s, Joseph Harding, known as the modern father of Cheddar Cheese, revolutionized the cheddar cheese making process with advanced technology.  He is responsible for launching the Cheddar cheese making industries of Scotland, Canada, America and Australia.  Today this most famous English Cheese is made throughout the world, but especially in past members of the British Empire.  Cheddar is naturally white or pale yellow in color, the yellow coming from naturally occuring carotene in grass eaten by dairy cows. Darker yellow to orange varieties are produced using a natural food colorant called annatto.  Almost synonymous today with the phrase English Cheese, Cheddar develops a stronger, sharper taste the longer it ages.  West Country Farmhouse Cheddar has been given PDO (name protection) status from the EU, requiring that it be produced from the milk within Devon, Dorset, Cornwall or Somerset, England. [PAR] Cheshire: Cheshire is considered to be the original English Cheese. It is firm and crumbly in texture with a mild, slightly salty flavor.  This white, or more typically yellow-orange cheese, again colored by annatto, is great crumbled over salads. It is also delicious with fruit or as a dessert cheese. [PAR] Lancashire: Lancashire is another ancient English Cheese whose history dates back to the 1200s.  It is traditionally made in three varieties based on the cheese's maturity: Creamy, Tasty or Crumbly.  Creamy Lancashire is matured between 4 and 12 weeks, while Tasty is matured from 12 weeks to 24 months.  Crumbly Lancashire was first produced in the 1960s and is usually eaten at 6 to 8 weeks in age.  Crumbly Lancashire is mild and fresh-tasting with a firm, dry and crumbly texture. We sometimes think of it as England's answer to Feta. [PAR] Blue Stilton: Known as the \"The King Of English Cheeses,\" Blue Stilton is a blue-mold English Cheese with a rich and mellow flavor and a smooth and creamy consistency.  Blue Stilton is recognized by its striking blue-green veins, naturally crinkly rind (inedible), complex flavor and crumbly texture. While Blue Stilton is milder than other famous blues of the world like Roquefort and Gorgonzola, it is excellent for crumbling over salads or as a dessert cheese, famously served with a Port Wine. This traditional English Cheese has been awarded PDO status, which maintains that it can only be made in the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire or Leicestershire from locally produced pasteurized milk. [PAR] White Stilton: White Stilton is produced in the same manner as Blue Stilton, without blue mold added to the milk.  The result is a fresh,",

[PAR] Jacob persevered in his love for Rachel. He proved to be a hard worker. [PAR] Jacob's Strengths [PAR] Jacob was clever. Sometimes this trait worked for him, and sometimes it backfired on him. [PAR] He used both his mind and strength to build his wealth and family. [PAR] Jacob's Weaknesses [PAR] Sometimes Jacob made his own rules, deceiving others for selfish gain. He did not trust God to work things out. [PAR] Even though God revealed himself to Jacob in the Bible, Jacob took a long time to become a true servant of the Lord. [PAR] He favored Joseph over his other sons, leading to jealousy and strife within his family. [PAR] Life Lessons [PAR] The sooner we trust God in life, the longer we will benefit from his blessings. When we fight God, we are in a losing battle. [PAR] We often worry about missing the will of God for our life, but God works with our mistakes and bad decisions. His plans cannot be upset.

The rider leading a classification at the end of a stage is required to wear  the corresponding jersey during the next stage. [PAR] Jerseys  are awarded in a ceremony immediately following the stage. Where a single rider leads in the competition for more than one jersey, they  wear the most prestigious jersey to which they are entitled, and the  second-placed rider in each of the other classifications becomes entitled to  wear the corresponding jersey. [PAR] Yellow Jersey [PAR] The yellow jersey, known in French as the maillot jaune, is worn by the overall time  leader, and is the most prized jersey. It is awarded by calculating the total combined race  time up to that point for each rider. The yellow jersey was first awarded in 1919 to make the race leader stand out. The color yellow was chosen because the pages of the race sponsor's magazine,  L'Auto, were yellow. [PAR] Green Jersey [PAR] The green jersey, known in French as the maillot vert, is awarded to the cyclist with the highest number of sprint points. Points for this jersey are gained by the riders who  finish first, second, etc., at the end of each stage. The number of points for each place and the number  of riders rewarded varies depending on the type of stage as the flatter stages are more likely to result in a sprint finish. Flat stages give the  winner 35 points down to 1 point for the 25th rider; medium mountain stages  give the winner 25 points down to 1 point for the 20th rider; high mountain  stages give the winner 20 points down to 1 point for the 15th rider. Points are also awarded for  individual time trial stages: 15 for the winner down to 1 for the 10th rider. Additional points are available at intermediate sprint contests, usually  occurring 2 or 3 times in each stage at pre-determined locations; currently 6,  4 and 2 points are available to the first 3 riders at each sprint. [PAR] Polka Dot  Jersey [PAR] The  winner of the King of the Mountain wears a white jersey with red  dots (known as the maillot \u00e0 pois rouges in French), which is commonly referred to as the \"polka dot jersey\". Although the best climber was first recognized in 1933 as the \"King of the Mountain\", the distinctive  polka dot jersey was not introduced until 1975. The colors were decided by the then  sponsor, Poulain Chocolate, to match a popular product. At the top of each climb in the Tour,  there are points awarded for the riders who are first over the top. The climbs are  divided into categories, from 1  to 4  based on  their difficulty with 1 being the most difficult, measured as a function of their steepness and length. A fifth  category, called Hors categorie (outside category) is formed by  mountains even more difficult than those of the number 1 category. In 2004, the  scoring system was changed so that the first rider over a fourth category  climb was awarded 3 points while the first to complete a hors category  climb would win 20 points. Further points over a fourth category climb are only  for the top three places while on a hors category climb the top ten riders are  rewarded. Also, beginning in 2004, the points scored on the final climb of  the day were doubled if such a climb was at least a second category climb. [PAR] White Jersey [PAR] A lesser classification is  that for the white jersey (known as the maillot blanc in French), which is like the yellow  jersey, but only open for young riders (those who are less than 25 years old on  January 1 of the year the Tour is ridden).

For the time being, they have the fairly clunky Latin and Greek numerical names ununtium (Uut), ununpentium (Uup), ununseptium (Uus), and ununoctium (Uuo), but, by IUPAC rules, their discovers now get the chance to officially name them. [PAR] Online, there\u2019s growing support to name one of these new \u201cheavy metal\u201d elements lemmium in honor of Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy (who died two days before they were announced), and another octarine after the fictional \u201ccolor of magic\u201d in the late Sir Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novels (Pratchett\u00a0died in March 2015). Whether these two petitions will come to fruition remains to be seen\u2014the final names are not likely to be announced until later in the spring\u2014but as IUPAC rules demand all new elements be named after either a mythological concept or character, a mineral, a place, a property of the element itself, or a scientist [ PDF ], it seems unlikely we\u2019ll be seeing lemmium on the walls of chemistry classes any time soon. The stories behind 20 other chemical element names are explained here.\u00a0 [PAR] 1. LITHIUM (3) [PAR] Despite being the least dense metal, lithium takes its name from the Greek word for \u201cstone,\u201d lithos, because it was discovered in a rock (as opposed to the other alkali metals potassium and sodium, which were discovered in plants and animals).\u00a0 [PAR] 2. CARBON (6) [PAR] The name carbon comes from the Latin word carbo, meaning \u201ccoal\u201d or \u201ccharcoal.\u201d A small carbo, incidentally, was a carbunculus, which is the origin of carbuncle.\u00a0 [PAR] 3. NEON (10) [PAR] Neon takes its name from neos, the Greek word for \u201cnew\u201d (it was \u201cnewly\u201d discovered in 1898). [PAR] 4. PHOSPHORUS (15) [PAR] Phosphorus literally means \u201clight-bearer\u201d or \u201clight-bringing,\u201d as the first compound of the element glowed in the dark. A century before it became the name of element 15 in the late 1600s, Phosphorus was an alternative name for the planet Venus, whose appearance in the sky was once believed to strengthen the light and heat of the Sun. [PAR] 5. VANADIUM (23) [PAR] One of the transition metals, pure vanadium is a harsh steel-grey color, but four of its oxidation states produce a rainbow of solutions, colored purple, green, blue, and yellow . Because he was so impressed with how beautiful and varied these solutions were, the Swedish chemist Nils Sefstr\u00f6m chose to name vanadium after Vanad\u00eds, an alternate name for the Norse goddess of beauty, Freya. Vanadium\u2019s next door neighbor, chromium (24), also produces a variety of colored compounds and so takes its name from the Greek word for \u201ccolor,\u201d chroma.\u00a0 [PAR] 6. COBALT (27) [PAR] Cobalt is often naturally found alongside or in minerals combined with arsenic, and when smelted, cobalt ore can emit noxious arsenic-laden fumes. Long before the poisonous qualities of minerals like these could be explained by science, copper\u00a0miners in central Europe had no better explanation than to presume these toxic effects were supernatural, and were caused by devious underground goblins called kobolds who lived inside the rock\u2014and it's from the German word kobold that cobalt gets its name.\u00a0 [PAR] 7. COPPER (29) [PAR] The chemical symbol for copper is Cu, which derives from the metal\u2019s Latin name, cuprum. In turn, cuprum is descended from Kyprios, the Ancient Greek name for the island of Cyprus, which was well known in antiquity for its production of copper.

It is produced by the Met Office and broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The forecasts sent over the Navtex system use a similar format and the same sea areas. The waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas (see map below)  There are four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: [PAR] * 0048 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from an extended list of coastal stations at 0052 and an inshore waters forecast at 0055 and concludes with a brief UK weather outlook for the coming day. The broadcast finishes at approximately 0058. [PAR] * 0520 \u2013 transmitted on FM and LW. Includes weather reports from coastal stations at 0525, and an inshore waters forecast at 0527. [PAR] * 1201 \u2013 normally transmitted on LW only. [PAR] * 1754 \u2013 transmitted only on LW on weekdays, as an opt-out from the PM programme, but at weekends transmitted on both FM and LW. [PAR] The unique and distinctive sound of these broadcasts has led to their attracting an audience much wider than that directly interested in maritime weather conditions. Many listeners find the repetition of the names of the sea areas almost hypnotic, particularly during the night-time broadcast at 0048 UK time. [PAR] History [PAR] In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450\u00a0people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications. This remained the United Kingdom's Met Office primary responsibility for some time afterwards. In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.  [PAR] Today, although most ships have onboard technology to provide the Forecast's information, they still use it to check their data. [PAR] On Friday 30 May 2014, for the first time in more than 90 years, the BBC failed to broadcast the Shipping Forecast at 5:20 am. Staff at Broadcasting House were reading out the report but it was not transmitted. Listeners instead heard BBC World Service.  [PAR] Region names [PAR] The 31 sea areas covering the waters around the British Isles are as defined by the map shown here: [PAR] * Viking [PAR] * North Utsire [PAR] * South Utsire [PAR] * Forties [PAR] * Cromarty [PAR] * Forth [PAR] * Tyne [PAR] * Dogger [PAR] * Fisher [PAR] * German Bight [PAR] * Humber [PAR] * Thames [PAR] * Dover [PAR] * Wight [PAR] * Portland [PAR] * Plymouth [PAR] * Biscay [PAR] * Trafalgar [PAR] * FitzRoy [PAR] * Sole [PAR] * Lundy [PAR] * Fastnet [PAR] * Irish Sea [PAR] * Shannon [PAR] * Rockall [PAR] * Malin [PAR] * Hebrides [PAR] * Bailey [PAR] * Fair Isle [PAR] * Faeroes [PAR] * Southeast Iceland [PAR] The areas were already roughly as listed above by 1949. Later modifications include the introduction of Fisher in 1955, when Dogger was split in two. Heligoland was renamed German Bight a year later. Around 1983, the Minches sea area was merged with Hebrides. In 1984, the areas in the North Sea were coordinated with those of neighbouring countries, introducing North Utsire and South Utsire and reducing Viking in size. Finisterre was renamed FitzRoy in 2002, to avoid confusion with the (smaller) sea area of the same name used in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.  Some names still differ; for example, the Dutch KNMI names the area equivalent to Forties after the Fladen bank, while M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France calls the English Channel sea areas Dover, Wight, Portland, and Plymouth respectively Pas de Calais, Antifer, Casquets, and Ouessant.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Legal tenderLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.  Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency. [PAR] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. However, restaurants that do not collect payment until after a meal is served must accept any legal tender for the debt incurred in purchasing the meal. [PAR] The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English tendren, French tendre (verb form), meaning to offer. The Latin root is tendere (to stretch out), and the sense of tender as an offer is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).  [PAR] Demonetisation [PAR] Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency substitute them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.   Examples of this are: [PAR] *The United Kingdom, adopting decimal currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971. Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p - 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (\u00bdp, 1p, 2p  equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d ( = 2\u00bdp), 1 and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it. Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed for legal tender without time limits, but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value. [PAR] *The successor states of the Soviet Union replacing the Soviet ruble in the 1990s. [PAR] *Currencies used in the Eurozone before being replaced by the euro are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit). However, in Italy Mario Monti declared Italian Lira banknotes unredeemable for euros some months before the regular expiration of the 10-year term, and this is also true when the banknotes were lost before and then are found after",

[PAR] Editorial Reviews [PAR] Product Description [PAR] In the projects. On the docks. In City Hall. In the schools. In the media. The places and faces have changed, but the game remains the same. [PAR] Review [PAR] The Wire: The Complete First Season [PAR] After one episode of The Wire you'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of  its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series'  remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American  masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter  from The Baltimore Sun who cowrote the book that inspired TV's Homicide ,  and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable  street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece to The Corner )  that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on  institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil  police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price  (especially Clockers), the series opens as maverick Detective  Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a  vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's  deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a  haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex  investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance. [PAR] The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so  breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to  life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description.  Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the  unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson,  helmer of The Shield's finest episodes), but they are servants to  the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable,  complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention, The Wire is \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy  answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate  in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the  cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to  the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving  you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in  season 2. --Jeff Shannon [PAR] The Wire: The Complete Second Season [PAR] It hardly seems possible, but The Wire's second season is even better than the first .  The \"visual novel\" concept of this masterful HBO series is taken even  further in a rich, labyrinthine plot revolving around the longshoremen  of Baltimore's struggling cargo docks, where corruption, smuggling, and  murder draw the attention of detective McNulty (Dominic West). What  follows is a series of events which at first seem unrelated (including  13 bodies found in a cargo container), and then the ongoing effort to  topple the drug empire of \"Stringer\" Bell (Idris Elba) and the  imprisoned Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris), whose business is suffering  from short supply, high demand, and disruption of distribution. The  dutiful diligence of a Marine Police Patrol Officer and the moral  outrage of the longshoremen's union leader are also factored into the  suspicious goings-on at the loading docks, and what unfolds in these 12  episodes is an American crime epic easily on par with the Godfather saga. Yes, it's that good. [PAR] Detailed synopsis",

He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth. He did not continue his formal education at university, nor did he come under the mentorship of a senior artist, nor did he marry into wealth or prestige. His talent as an actor seems to have been modest, since he is not known for starring roles. His success as a playwright depended in part upon royal patronage. Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. [PAR] Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon. At that time, infants were baptized three days after their birth, thus scholars believe that Shakespeare was born on April 23, the same day on which he died at age 52. As the third of eight children, young William grew up in this small town 100 miles northwest of London, far from the cultural and courtly center of England. [PAR] Shakespeare attended the local grammar school, King's New School, where the curriculum would have stressed a classical education of Greek mythology, Roman comedy, ancient history, rhetoric, grammar, Latin, and possibly Greek. Throughout his childhood, Shakespeare's father struggled with serious financial debt. Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585. In the seven years following their birth, the historical record concerning Shakespeare is incomplete, contradictory, and unreliable; scholars refer to this period as his \u201clost years.\u201d [PAR] In a 1592 pamphlet by Robert Greene, Shakespeare reappears as an \u201cupstart crow\u201d flapping his poetic wings in London. Evidently, it did not take him long to land on the stage. Between 1590 and 1592, Shakespeare's Henry VI series, Richard III, and The Comedy of Errors were performed. When the theaters were closed in 1593 because of the plague, the playwright wrote two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and probably began writing his richly textured sonnets. One hundred and fiftyfour of his sonnets have survived, ensuring his reputation as a gifted poet. By 1594, he had also written, The Taming of the Shrew, The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love's Labor's Lost. [PAR] Having established himself as an actor and playwright, in 1594 Shakespeare became a shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain's Men, one of the most popular acting companies in London. He remained a member of this company for the rest of his career, often playing before the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Shakespeare entered one of his most prolific periods around 1595, writing Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Merchant of Venice. With his newfound success, Shakespeare purchased the second largest home in Stratford in 1597, though he continued to live in London. Two years later, he joined others from the Lord Chamberlain's Men in establishing the polygonal Globe Theatre on the outskirts of London. When King James came to the throne in 1603, he issued a royal license to Shakespeare and his fellow players, organizing them as the King's Men. During King James's reign, Shakespeare wrote many of his most accomplished plays about courtly power, including King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra. In 1609 or 1611, Shakespeare's sonnets were published, though he did not live to see the First Folio of his plays published in 1623. [PAR] In 1616, with his health declining, Shakespeare revised his will. Since his only son Hamnet had died",

The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.\u00a0 Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.\u00a0 The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.\u00a0 The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley\" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.\u00a0 He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real. But he did have fun playing in the clouds. He made Sir Basil suffer when he shot his tail off, as he pretended to be dead. Poor Sir Basil didn't know what to do, so as usual shouted for Lady Rosemary, who saw Parsley was faking it. His best friend is Dill the dog and both of them seem to get themselves into trouble. But once in a while Parsley does come up with a good idea, such as the time he persuaded Pashana Bedhi to use his snake charming skills to float Sage and his nest back in the tree. \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley with a tail for doing jobs of every kind but I mustn't treat it roughly or too harshly for it's such a useful thing to have behind\" His songs are: \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I am always very glad to see you wave but please don't shout or speak to me too harshly because I'm not particularly brave\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I really don't like climbing things at all so please don't shout or speak to me too harshly I am sure you wouldn't want to see me fall\" \"I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I'm supposed to pull this rope and ring the bell though I try to pull it gently never harshly I'm afraid that I'm not doing very well\" \"For today I",

[PAR] Released 4/14/2014 [PAR] Herpes Zoster in People Who Received Varicella Vaccine [PAR] Herpes zoster, also known as zoster and shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). [PAR] Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Once the illness resolves, the virus remains dormant (latent) in the dorsal root ganglia. VZV can reactive later in a person\u2019s life and cause a painful, maculopapular rash called herpes zoster. [PAR] Anyone who has had varicella or gotten varicella vaccine can develop herpes zoster. Most people typically have only one episode of herpes zoster in their lifetime. However, second and even third episodes are possible. [PAR] Clinical Features [PAR] People with herpes zoster most commonly have a rash in one or two adjacent dermatomes (localized zoster). The rash most commonly appears on the trunk along a thoracic dermatome. The rash does not usually cross the body\u2019s midline. However, approximately 20% of people have rash that overlaps adjacent dermatomes. Less commonly, the rash can be more widespread and affect three or more dermatomes. This condition is called disseminated zoster. This generally occurs only in people with compromised or suppressed immune systems. Disseminated zoster can be difficult to distinguish from varicella. [PAR] The rash is usually painful, itchy or tingly. These symptoms may precede rash onset by days to weeks. Some people may also have headache, photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), and malaise in the prodromal phase. [PAR] The rash develops into clusters of clear vesicles. New vesicles continue to form over three to five days and progressively dry and crust over. They usually heal in two to four weeks. There may be permanent pigmentation changes and scarring on the skin. [PAR] Complications [PAR] Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster. It is a persistent pain in the area where the rash once was. PHN is diagnosed in people who have pain that persists after their rash has resolved. Some define PHN as any duration of pain after the rash resolves; others define it as duration of pain for more than 30 days, or for more than 90 days after rash onset. PHN can last for weeks or months and occasionally, for many years. [PAR] A person's risk of having PHN after herpes zoster increases with age. Older adults are more likely to have PHN and to have longer lasting and more severe pain. Approximately 13% (and possibly more) of people 60 years of age and older with herpes zoster will get PHN. PHN is rare in people younger than 40 years old. Other predictors of PHN include the level of pain a person has when they have the rash and the size of their rash. [PAR] Other complications of herpes zoster include\u2014 [PAR] ophthalmic involvement with acute or chronic ocular sequelae (herpes zoster ophthalmicus); [PAR] bacterial superinfection of the lesions, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus and, less commonly, due to group A beta hemolytic streptococcus; [PAR] cranial and peripheral nerve palsies; and [PAR] visceral involvement, such as meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and acute retinal necrosis. [PAR] People with compromised or suppressed immune systems are more likely to have complications from herpes zoster. They are more likely to have severe rash that lasts longer. Also, they are at increased risk of developing disseminated herpes zoster. [PAR] \u00a0 Top of Page [PAR] Vaccination [PAR] The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends zoster vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) for people aged 60 years and older. Even people who have had herpes zoster should receive the vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. [PAR] Herpes zoster vaccine is approved by FDA for people aged 50 years and older. However, CDC does not recommend routine use of herpes zoster vaccine in people aged 50 through 59 years old. Health care providers considering the herpes zoster vaccine for certain persons aged 50 through 59 years should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their patients.",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Last of the Summer WineLast of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke that was originally broadcast on the BBC. Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973, and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show. The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last.  Subsequently, the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010.  Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode.  Roy Clarke, however, stated that he was fully aware this was the last series, and preferred the show to have a quiet ending.  The final line was said by Peter Sallis, the longest serving actor.  Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold, Yesterday, and Drama. It is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,  including various PBS stations in the United States and on VisionTV in Canada. Last of the Summer Wine is the longest-running comedy programme in Britain and the longest-running sitcom in the world.   [PAR] Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as deep-thinking and meek Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter \"Foggy\" Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert \"Truly of The Yard\" Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines. [PAR] After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, Tom Owen, as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite, Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood, and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent, Luther \"Hobbo\" Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman, \"Electrical\" Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin Smedley. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors. [PAR] Although many feel the show's quality declined over the years,  Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people  and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series. Last of the Summer Wine inspired other adaptations, including a television prequel,  several novelisations,  and stage adaptations.  [PAR] Production [PAR] History and development [PAR]",

[PAR] The Football League, also known as the npower Football League for sponsorship reasons, is a league competition featuring professional association football clubs from England and Wales. [PAR] Founded in 1888, it is the oldest such competition in world football. It was the top level football league in England from its foundation until 1992. [PAR] Since 1995 it has had 72 clubs evenly divided into three divisions, which are currently known as The Championship, League One and League Two. Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest placed clubs in the Premier League. [PAR] A director of Aston Villa, William McGregor, was the first to set out to bring some order to a chaotic world where clubs arranged their own fixtures. On March 2, 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. [PAR] The first meeting was held at Anderson's Hotel in London on March 23, 1888, on the eve of the FA Cup Final. The Football League was formally created and named in Manchester at a further meeting on April 17 at the Royal Hotel. [PAR] In 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League to take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal and on May 27, 1992, the Premier League as we know it today was formed. [PAR] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. [PAR] There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions. [PAR] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon. [PAR] A total of 43 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992 until the end of the 2009/10 season. Two other clubs (Luton Town and Notts County) were signatories to the original agreement that created the Premier League, but were relegated prior to the inaugural Premier League season and have not subsequently returned to the top flight. [PAR] Seven clubs have been members of the Premier League for every season since its inception.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] NATOThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO; ; '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4\u00a0April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22\u00a0countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15\u00a0other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70 percent of the global total.  Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2 percent of GDP. [PAR] NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion\u2014doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the organization was drawn into the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004. [PAR] Article\u00a05 of the North Atlantic treaty, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks,  after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations  and in 2011 enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. The less potent Article 4, which merely invokes consultation among NATO members, has been invoked five times: by Turkey in 2003 over the Iraq War; twice in 2012 by Turkey over the Syrian Civil War, after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F-4 reconnaissance jet, and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria;  in 2014 by Poland, following the Russian intervention in Crimea;  and again by Turkey in 2015 after threats by the Islamic State to its territorial integrity.  [PAR] History  [PAR] Beginnings  [PAR] The Treaty of Brussels, signed on 17\u00a0March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the NATO agreement. The treaty and the Soviet Berlin Blockade led to the creation of the Western European Union's Defence Organization in September 1948. However, participation of the United States was thought necessary both to counter the military power of the USSR and to prevent the revival of nationalist militarism, so talks for a new military alliance began almost immediately resulting in the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed in Washington, D.C. on 4\u00a0April 1949. It included the five Treaty of Brussels states plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was \"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.\" Popular support for the Treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949. The creation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called Atlanticism which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Homer SimpsonHomer Jay Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated television series The Simpsons as the patriarch of the eponymous family. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \"Good Night\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family got their own series on Fox that debuted December 17, 1989. [PAR] Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is essentially a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences. [PAR] In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons\u00a0\u2013 including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books\u00a0\u2013 and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"D'oh!\", has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the Oxford English Dictionary since 2001. [PAR] Homer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television. The British newspaper The Sunday Times described him as \"the greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by Entertainment Weekly, was ranked the second greatest cartoon character by TV Guide, behind Bugs Bunny, and was voted the greatest television character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and a special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. [PAR] Role in The Simpsons [PAR] Homer is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. He is the son of Mona and Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson. Homer held over 188 different jobs in the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons. In most episodes, he works as the Nuclear Safety Inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position he has held since \"Homer's Odyssey\", the third episode of the series.  At the plant, Homer is often ignored and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and constantly falls asleep and neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have Homer work at the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak havoc.  Each of his other jobs has lasted only one episode. In the first half of the series, the writers developed an explanation about how he got fired from the plant and was then rehired in every episode. In later episodes, he often began a new job on impulse, without any mention of his regular employment.  [PAR] The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters never physically age, and, as such, the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. Nevertheless, in several episodes, events in Homer's life have been linked to specific time periods. \"Mother Simpson\" (season seven, 1995) depicts Homer's mother, Mona, as a radical who went into hiding in 1969 following a run-in with the law; \"The Way We",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] U.S. stateA state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.  State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). [PAR] States range in population from just under 600,000 (Wyoming) to over 38 million (California), and in area from  (Rhode Island) to  (Alaska). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. [PAR] States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.  [PAR] States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution; among them ratifying constitutional amendments. Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the U.S. Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. [PAR] States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, and at least one Representative, while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.  Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state.  [PAR] The Constitution grants to Congress  the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. [PAR] The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw from) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v. White, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.   [PAR] States of the United States [PAR] The 50 U.S. states (in alphabetical order), along with state flag and date each joined the union: [PAR] Governments [PAR] As each state is itself a sovereign entity, it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. [PAR] Constitutions [PAR] The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nThe given context provides a comprehensive overview of the Beaufort scale, which is a method used to estimate wind speed based on observable conditions at sea and on land. The Beaufort scale categorizes wind speed into 13 different classes, ranging from \"Light air\" (0-3 knots) to \"Violent storm\" (56-63 knots). Each class is accompanied by a description of the corresponding wave height, sea conditions, and land effects.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the Beaufort scale is based on the principle that wind speed can be inferred from the observable effects it has on the ocean surface and on land. The descriptions provided for each class of wind speed demonstrate a clear understanding of the complex relationships between wind speed, wave height, and sea conditions. Furthermore, the Beaufort scale is widely used in meteorology and navigation to estimate wind speed in the absence of direct measurements.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI rate the difficulty of this topic as an 8 out of 10. The Beaufort scale is a complex system that requires a deep understanding of the relationships between wind speed, wave height, and sea conditions. While the concept is well-established, the nuances of the Beaufort scale make it challenging to grasp, especially for those without prior knowledge of meteorology or navigation.\n\n### Intentional Question Planning\n\nTo create a question that invites deeper understanding and meaningful reflection, I will focus on a specific aspect of the Beaufort scale that requires careful consideration of the relationships between wind speed, wave height, and sea conditions. The question will challenge the domain expert to think critically about the implications of the Beaufort scale and its applications in meteorology and navigation.\n\n### Identification and Ignoring of Irrelevant Information\n\nUpon examination, the provided context is highly relevant to the topic of the Beaufort scale. There are no hyperlinks, advertisements, headers, footers, navigation menus, disclaimers, social media buttons, or other irrelevant content that could be excluded from the analysis.\n\n### Decision Criteria for Question Generation\n\nBased on the meaningful content requirement, I will generate a question that encourages thoughtful engagement with the Beaufort scale.

[PAR] After the sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, the great ship slumbered on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean for over 70 years before its wreckage was discovered. On September 1, 1985, a joint American-French expedition, headed by famous American oceanographer Dr. Robert Ballard, found the Titanic over two miles below the ocean\u2019s surface by using an unmanned submersible called Argo. This discovery gave new meaning to the Titanic\u2019s sinking and gave birth to new dreams in ocean exploration. [PAR] The Titanic\u2019s Journey [PAR] Built in Ireland from 1909 to 1912 on behalf of the British-owned White Star Line, the Titanic officially left its final European port of Queenstown, Ireland on April 11, 1912. Carrying over 2,200 passengers and crew, the Titanic began its maiden voyage across the Atlantic, headed for New York. [PAR] The Titanic carried passengers from all walks of life. Tickets were sold to first, second, and third class passengers; the latter group largely consisting of immigrants seeking a better life. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Famous first class passengers included the Astors, the Strausses, J. Bruce Ismay, and Benjamin Guggenheim. [PAR] The Sinking of the Titanic [PAR] Only three days after setting sail, the Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on April 14, 1912, somewhere in the North Atlantic. Although it took the ship over two and a half hours to sink, the vast majority of the crew and passengers perished due to a significant lack of lifeboats and improper use of those that did exist. The lifeboats could have held over 1,100 people, but only 705 people were saved; nearly 1,500 perished the night the Titanic sank. [PAR] People around the world were shocked when they heard that the \u201cunsinkable\u201d Titanic had sunk. They wanted to know the details of the disaster. Yet, however much the survivors could share, theories about how and why the Titanic sank would remain unsubstantiated until the wreckage of the great ship could be found. There was just one problem -- no one was sure exactly where the Titanic had sunk. [PAR] Robert Ballard [PAR] Robert Ballard wanted to find the wreckage of the Titanic. Ballard had grown up in San Diego, California, near the ocean, where he began his life-long fascination with the ocean and learned to scuba dive. After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965 with degrees in both chemistry and geology, Ballard signed up for the Army. Two years later, in 1967, Ballard transferred to the Navy, where he was assigned to the Deep Submergence Group at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Research Institution in Massachusetts, thus beginning his illustrious career with submersibles. [PAR] By 1974, Ballard had received two doctoral degrees (marine geology and geophysics) from the University of Rhode Island and had spent a lot of time conducting deep water dives in a manned submersible he helped design, called Alvin. During subsequent dives in 1977 and 1979 near the Galapagos Rift, Ballard helped discover hydrothermal vents . More importantly, though, were the amazing plants that grew around these vents; it was the scientific study of these plants that led to the discovery of chemosynthesis , a process in which plants use chemical reactions rather than sunlight to get energy. [PAR] Yet, however many shipwrecks Ballard explored and however much of the ocean floor he mapped, Ballard never forgot about the Titanic. Ballard has said, \u201cI always wanted to find the Titanic.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] MinnesotaMinnesota (; locally ) is a state in the Midwestern United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The name comes from the Dakota word for \"clear blue water\".  Owing to its large number of lakes, the state is informally known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is L'\u00c9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).    [PAR] Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin Cities\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. [PAR] Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. The French voyageurs and later English fur trappers were the earliest non-native inhabitants. A large majority of the early territory and statehood settlers emigrated from the Eastern United States and Western Europe including Germany, Scandinavia, and Ireland. Eastern Europeans immigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, with many first working in iron mines. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, Somalia, and Latin America has broadened the state's historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota has America's largest Somali population.  Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The word Minnesota comes from the Dakota name for the Minnesota River: Mnisota. The root mni (also spelled mini or minne) means \"water\" and \"t\u014d\" (\"ta\") means \"blue\".  Mnisota can be translated as clear blue water or clouded blue water depending on pronunciation.   Native Americans demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it mnisota. Many places in the state have similar names, such as Minnehaha Falls (\"laughing water\" (waterfall)), Minneiska (\"white water\"), Minneota (\"much water\"), Minnetonka (\"big water\"), Minnetrista (\"crooked water\"), and Minneapolis, a combination of mni and polis, the Greek word for \"city\".  [PAR] Geography [PAR] Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after Alaska). Its isolated Northwest Angle in Lake of the Woods county is the only part of the 48 contiguous states lying north of the 49th parallel. The state is part of the U.S. region known as the Upper Midwest and part of North America's Great Lakes Region. It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north. With ,  or approximately 2.25 percent of the United States,  Minnesota is the 12th-largest state.  [PAR] Geology [PAR] Minnesota contains some of the oldest rocks found on earth, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the primordial ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota.  The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.

Eager to keep the Empire in the Grand Alliance (England, Habsburg Empire, Dutch Republic, Portugal, Spain, & the Duchy of Savoy), the Duke of Marlborough made plans to intercept the French and Bavarian forces before they could reach Vienna. Executing a brilliant campaign of disinformation and movement, Marlborough was able to shift his army from the Low Countries to the Danube in only five weeks, placing himself between the enemy and the Imperial capital. [PAR] Reinforced by Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy, Marlborough encountered the combined French and Bavarian army of Marshall Tallard along the banks of the Danube near the village of Blenheim. Separated from the Allies by a small stream and marsh known as the Nebel, Tallard arrayed his forces in a four mile-long line from the Danube north towards the hills and woods of the Swabian Jura. Anchoring the line were the villages of Lutzingen (left), Oberglau (center), and Blenheim (right). On the Allied side, Marlborough and Eug\u00e8ne had decided to attack Tallard on August 13. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Marlborough Attacks: [PAR] Assigning Prince Eug\u00e8ne to take Lutzingen, Marlborough ordered Lord John Cutts to attack Blenheim at 1:00 PM. Cutts repeatedly assaulted the village, but was unable to secure it. Though the attacks were not successful, they caused the French commander, Cl\u00e9rambault, to panic and order the reserves into the village. This mistake robbed Tallard of his reserve force and negated the slight numerical advantage he possessed over Marlborough. Seeing this error, Marlborough altered his orders to Cutts, instructing him to simply contain the French in the village. [PAR] At the opposite end of the line, Prince Eug\u00e8ne was having little success against the Bavarian forces defending Lutzingen, despite having launched multiple assaults. With Tallard's forces pinned down on the flanks, Marlborough pushed forward an attack on the French center. After heavy initial fighting, Marlborough was able to defeat Tallard's cavalry and routed the remaining French infantry. With no reserves, Tallard's line broke and his troops began fleeing towards H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt. They were joined in their flight by the Bavarians from Lutzingen. [PAR] Trapped in Blenheim, Cl\u00e9rambault's men continued the fight until 9:00 PM when over 10,000 of them surrendered. As the French fled southwest, a group of Hessian troops managed to capture Marshall Tallard, who was to spend the next seven years in captivity in England. [PAR] Battle of Blenheim - Aftermath & Impact: [PAR] In the fighting at Blenheim, the Allies lost 4,542 killed and 7,942 wounded, while the French and Bavarians suffered approximately 20,000 killed and wounded as well as 14,190 captured. The Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim ended the French threat to Vienna and removed the aura of invincibility that surrounded the armies of Louis XIV. The battle was a turning point in the War of Spanish Succession, ultimately leading to the Grand Alliance's victory and an end of French hegemony over Europe.",

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village. Sixty nations boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while the Soviets and",

Though the origins of curling are unclear, most people regard Scotland as curling\u2019s birthplace. Today, curling is played around the world, largely thanks to its introduction into the Olympics in 1988. Because curling can seem complicated if you don\u2019t know a lot about it, these articles help to explain the basics, from curling terminology and the roles of each position on a team, to how scoring and other elements of the game work, and why curling is such a great sport to play. [PAR] Curling Match Terminology [PAR] Curling, probably more than any other sport, has its own unique terminology (like hurry hard and burning a rock, among others). Here are the key curling words and phrases you need to know to blend in at your next bonspiel: [PAR] Blank end: An end where no points are scored. [PAR] Bonspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete. [PAR] Burning a rock: A rules infraction that happens when a player touches a stone as it\u2019s traveling down the sheet. [PAR] Button: The very center of the target rings or house. [PAR] Cashspiel: A tournament in which curlers compete for money. [PAR] Delivery: The action of throwing a stone to the other end of the playing surface. [PAR] Eight-ender: A perfect end where every one of the team\u2019s stones scores a point. [PAR] End: The way a curling game is divided. An end is like an inning in a baseball game. A curling game has either eight or ten ends. [PAR] Gripper: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you keep your footing on the ice. See slider. [PAR] Hammer: The last rock of the end. [PAR] Hack: The foothold in the ice you use to push off from when you deliver the stone. [PAR] House: Also known as the rings, this is the name of the giant bull\u2019s eye at either end of the sheet of ice. It consists of a set of concentric circles, called the 12-foot, 8-foot, 4-foot, and the Button. [PAR] Hurry hard: A directive given to sweepers by the skip or third, to begin sweeping. [PAR] Rink: A curling team; also the name of a curling facility [PAR] Rock: Also known as a stone, the granite playing utensil that a curler delivers. Regular-sized rocks weigh approximately 44 pounds. [PAR] Sheet: The frozen playing surface on which the game is played. [PAR] Slider: The sole of one of your curling shoes. It helps you move or slide along the ice. [PAR] Tee line: The line on the playing surface that runs through the middle of the house. [PAR] Weight: The amount of force used to deliver a stone. [PAR] The Members of a Curling Team [PAR] In curling, the team you play on is called a rink. The rink is made up of four players: the lead, the second, the third (also called the vice, vice-skip, or mate), and the skip. Each player has specific duties: [PAR] Lead: The lead throws the first two rocks of the end and then sweeps the next six. The lead must be very good at throwing guards and a strong sweeper. [PAR] Second: The second throws the third and fourth stones of the end and should be strong at playing takeouts. The second sweeps the first two stones and then the final four of the end. The second and the lead need to be in sync when sweeping together. [PAR] Third: The third (or mate or vice), who throws the fifth and sixth rocks of the end, must be good at all shots, but especially draws. It is the third\u2019s job to set up the shots that will be thrown by the skip, and to help the skip discuss the strategy of the final two stones of the end. The third also posts the score at the conclusion of the end",

With over 6,000 episodes, Countdown is one of the longest-running game shows in the world, along with the original French version, Des chiffres et des lettres (Numbers & Letters), which has been running on French television continuously since 1965. Countdown was initially recorded at The Leeds Studios for 27 years, before moving to Granada Studios in 2009, and then over to MediaCityUK in Salford Quays in 2013. [PAR] The programme was presented by Richard Whiteley for over 20 years, until his sudden death in June 2005. It was then presented by Des Lynam until the end of 2006, Des O'Connor until the end of 2008, and Jeff Stelling until the end of 2011; Nick Hewer has presented the show since 2012. Carol Vorderman, the show's co-host, who had also been on the programme since it began, left the show in December 2008, at the same time as Des O'Connor. She was replaced by Rachel Riley. Cathy Hytner originally placed letters on the board for the letters games before this was taken over by Vorderman. [PAR] A celebrity guest features in every programme, and provides a brief interlude midway between the two advertisement breaks. The two contestants in each episode compete in three disciplines: ten letters rounds, in which the contestants attempt to make the longest word possible from nine randomly chosen letters; four numbers rounds, in which the contestants must use arithmetic to reach a random target number from six other numbers; and the conundrum, a buzzer round in which the contestants compete to solve a nine-letter anagram. During the series heats, the winning contestant returns the next day until he or she loses or has accumulated eight wins (known as an Octochamp). The best eight contestants are invited back for the series finals, which are decided in knockout format. Contestants of exceptional skill have received national media coverage, and the programme as a whole is widely recognised and parodied within British culture.

The format was brought to Britain by Marcel Stellman, a Belgian record executive, who had watched the French show and believed it could be popular overseas.

As the presenter of Calendar, Richard Whiteley was the natural choice to present Calendar Countdown\u2014his daily appearances on both shows earned him the nickname \"Twice Nightly\".  These shows were only broadcast in the Yorkshire area.  [PAR] An additional pilot episode was made, with a refined format, although it was never broadcast.  A new British television channel, Channel 4, was due to launch in November 1982, and bought the newly renamed Countdown on the strength of this additional episode.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Bank of EnglandThe Bank of England, formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world, after the Sveriges Riksbank, and the world's 8th oldest bank. It was established to act as the English Government's banker and is still the banker for the Government of the United Kingdom. The Bank was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until nationalised in 1946.   [PAR] In 1998, it became an independent public organisation, wholly owned by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the government, with independence in setting monetary policy.     [PAR] The Bank is one of eight banks authorised to issue banknotes in the United Kingdom, but has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. [PAR] The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has devolved responsibility for managing monetary policy. The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee \"if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances\" but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days.  The Bank's Financial Policy Committee held its first meeting in June 2011 as a macro prudential regulator to oversee regulation of the UK's financial sector. [PAR] The Bank's headquarters have been in London's main financial district, the City of London, on Threadneedle Street, since 1734. It is sometimes known by the metonym The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street or The Old Lady, a name taken from the legend of Sarah Whitehead, whose ghost is said to haunt the Bank's garden.  The busy road junction outside is known as Bank junction. [PAR] Mark Carney assumed the post of Governor of the Bank of England on 1 July 2013. He succeeded Mervyn King, who took over on 30 June 2003. Carney, a Canadian, will serve an initial five-year term rather than the typical eight, and will seek UK citizenship.  He is the first non-British citizen to hold the post. As of January 2014, the Bank also has four Deputy Governors. [PAR] History [PAR] Founding [PAR] England's crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, became the catalyst for England's rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy. No public funds were available, and the credit of William III's government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the \u00a31,200,000 (at 8% p.a.) that the government wanted. [PAR] To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes.  The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The \u00a31.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy. [PAR] As a side effect, the huge industrial effort needed, including establishing ironworks to make more nails and advances in agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new Kingdom of Great Britain \u2013 England and Scotland were formally united in 1707 \u2013 to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  [PAR] The establishment of the bank was devised by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, in 1694, to the plan which had been proposed by William Paterson three years before, but not acted upon.  He proposed a loan of \u00a31.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as The Governor and Company of the Bank of England with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The Royal Charter was granted on 27 July through the passage of the Tonnage Act 1694",

The story and emotional content of a musical\u00a0\u2013 humor, pathos, love, anger\u00a0\u2013 are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals. [PAR] Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America.  These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma! (1943).  Some of the most famous and iconic musicals through the decades that followed include [PAR] West Side Story (1957), The Fantasticks (1960), Hair (1967), A Chorus Line (1975), Les Mis\u00e9rables (1985), The Phantom of the Opera (1986), Rent (1996), The Producers (2001), Wicked (2003) and Hamilton (2015). [PAR] Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America. [PAR] Definitions and scope  [PAR] Book musicals [PAR] Since the 20th century, the \"book musical\" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.   The three main components of a book musical are its music, lyrics and book. The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development, and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the libretto (Italian for \u201clittle book\u201d). The music and lyrics together form the score of a musical and includes songs; incidental music; and musical scenes, which are \"theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue.\" The interpretation of a musical by is influenced by its creative team, which includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound, which generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some famous production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in Chicago. [PAR] There is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short intermission and the first act frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music, and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves",

And he should be brainy \u2013 he should have little grey cells of the mind. [PAR] Agatha Christie - An Autobiography [PAR] About Hercule Poirot [PAR] The Beginning [PAR] Hercule Poirot came into existence during World War I. Agatha Christie was working as a VAD in Torquay, and encountered on a daily basis Belgian refugees arriving in England from the continent. Searching for a detective for her first novel, she set upon the idea of creating a Belgian detective who had been \"a former shining light of the Belgian police force\", before being forced out of his country. [PAR] Christie completed The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, but it wasn\u2019t published until four years later. In the novel, Poirot is called upon by his old friend Lieutenant Hastings, who would come to be the Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Christie later wrote that Poirot's introduction to detective fiction was not at all how he himself would have liked. \"Hercule Poirot first,\" he would have said, \"and then a plot to display his remarkable talents to their best advantage.\" [PAR] A Great Man [PAR] Poirot would be the first to call himself a great man - he has never been known for his modesty - but with such success in his career, it is difficult to argue with him. He finishes each case with a dramatic d\u00e9nouement, satisfying his own ego and confirming to all that he is truly \"the greatest mind in Europe.\" His love of elegance, beauty, and precision, as well as his eccentric mannerisms are often ridiculed by the local bumbling policemen, but it is always Poirot who has the last word. [PAR] My name is Hercule Poirot, and I am probably the greatest detective in the world. [PAR] Hercule Poirot, The Mystery of the Blue Train [PAR] Agatha Christie never imagined how popular Poirot would become, nor how many stories she would write about him. He stars in 33 novels and 54 short stories, including some of Christie's most successful such as Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile . [PAR] Poirot and Christie [PAR] One of Christie\u2019s later regrets was that Hercule Poirot began his literary life too mature: \"the result is that my fictional detective is well over a hundred by now.\" And it is no secret that character and author did not always see eye to eye. [PAR] \u201cThere are moments when I have felt: \u2018Why-why-why did I ever invent this detestable, bombastic, tiresome little creature?\u2019\u2026. But now, I must confess it, Hercule Poirot has won. A reluctant affection has sprung up for him\u2026\u201d Agatha Christie\u2019s introduction to the serialisation of Appointment With Death in the Daily Mail, 1938. [PAR] Christie grew tired of Poirot's idiosyncrasies so much so that she wrote Curtain: Poirot's Last Case in the 1940s. It was locked in a safe until 1974 when it was finally published, earning Poirot a well-deserved obituary in The New York Times; he is the only fictional character to have received such an honour. [PAR] Playing Poirot [PAR] The first actor to take on the role of the little Belgian was Charles Laughton in 1928 in the theatrical debut of Alibi. Austin Trevor was the first Poirot on screen in 1931, and went on to star in three films. There was Tony Randall in 1965 and Academy Award nominee Albert Finney in the all-star classic Murder on the Orient Express in 1974. The great Peter Ustinov, winner of two Academy Awards, played Poirot in six films and despite not physically resembling the character is still much loved worldwide. There was even a Japanese anim\u00e9 version of Poirot, broadcast in 2004. [PAR] Perhaps, however, the actor most synonymous with Hercule Poirot is David Suchet, who first took on the role in 1989. Christie never saw David Suchet's portrayal but her grandson, Mathew Prichard, thinks that she would have approved; Suchet balances \u201c",

He was the second of eight surviving children born to Carlo Buonaparte (1746-1785), a lawyer, and Letizia Romalino Buonaparte (1750-1836). Although his parents were members of the minor Corsican nobility, the family was not wealthy. The year before Napoleon\u2019s birth, France acquired Corsica from the city-state of Genoa, Italy. Napoleon later adopted a French spelling of his last name. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] In 1799, during Napoleon\u2019s military campaign in Egypt, a French soldier named Pierre Francois Bouchard (1772-1832) discovered the Rosetta Stone. This artifact provided the key to cracking the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics, a written language that had been dead for almost 2,000 years. [PAR] As a boy, Napoleon attended school in mainland France, where he learned the French language, and went on to graduate from a French military academy in 1785. He then became a second lieutenant in an artillery regiment of the French army. The French Revolution began in 1789, and within three years revolutionaries had overthrown the monarchy and proclaimed a French republic. During the early years of the revolution, Napoleon was largely on leave from the military and home in Corsica, where he became affiliated with the Jacobins, a pro-democracy political group. In 1793, following a clash with the nationalist Corsican governor, Pasquale Paoli (1725-1807), the Bonaparte family fled their native island for mainland France, where Napoleon returned to military duty. [PAR] In France, Napoleon became associated with Augustin Robespierre (1763-1794), the brother of revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre (1758-1794), a Jacobin who was a key force behind the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), a period of violence against enemies of the revolution. During this time, Napoleon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the army. However, after Robespierre fell from power and was guillotined (along with Augustin) in July 1794, Napoleon was briefly put under house arrest for his ties to the brothers. [PAR] In 1795, Napoleon helped suppress a royalist insurrection against the revolutionary government in Paris and was promoted to major general. [PAR] Napoleon\u2019s Rise to Power [PAR] Since 1792, France\u2019s revolutionary government had been engaged in military conflicts with various European nations. In 1796, Napoleon commanded a French army that defeated the larger armies of Austria, one of his country\u2019s primary rivals, in a series of battles in Italy. In 1797, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, resulting in territorial gains for the French. [PAR] The following year, the Directory, the five-person group that had governed France since 1795, offered to let Napoleon lead an invasion of England. Napoleon determined that France\u2019s naval forces were not yet ready to go up against the superior British Royal Navy. Instead, he proposed an invasion of Egypt in an effort to wipe out British trade routes with India. Napoleon\u2019s troops scored a victory against Egypt\u2019s military rulers, the Mamluks, at the Battle of the Pyramids in July 1798; soon, however, his forces were stranded after his naval fleet was nearly decimated by the British at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. In early 1799, Napoleon\u2019s army launched an invasion of Ottoman-ruled Syria, which ended with the failed siege of Acre, located in modern-day Israel.

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for males, and this section will discuss the 4 main types of male voices, their respective pitch ranges, unique tonal characteristics, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One important point to note: These 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type \u2013 are not to be confused with each other. [PAR] The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that our voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas the Type of Voice refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to understand more about how to find your own vocal range, as well as how to determine your own voice type using the various criteria! [PAR] Now, the 4 main types of male voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Countertenor [PAR] Let us look at each of these male voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. COUNTERTENOR [PAR] The Countertenor Voice may actually be unfamiliar to those of us not from the classical realm, as many of us would probably only have heard of the 3 main male voices \u2013 Tenor, Baritone and Bass. [PAR] The Countertenor voice is the highest of the adult male voice types, and has a vocal range that is similar to that of the Female Contralto Voice, the lowest of the female voice types! In the Mandarin pop scene, certain singers like Jeff Chang and the lead singer of popular pop rock band Soda Green would probably qualify as countertenor voices! [PAR] An approximate Countertenor Vocal Range would be from a G note below the middle C (G3) to a high F one octave above the middle C (F5). Be sure to support your voice well with your breath so as to get a more accurate representation of the range in your voice. Check out the section on \u2018How to Find Your Singing Range and Voice Type\u2019 to get some tips on finding your range on your own! [PAR] Also, the Tessitura or most comfortable singing range for Countertenors lies above that of the Tenor and other adult male voices. The Countertenor voice would usually be able to sing the high head voice notes with great ease and brightness in tone, and would often be confused by many listeners with regular female voices. [PAR] 2. TENOR [PAR] The Tenor Voice is the highest of the main male vocal types that most people would be familiar with, with the typical tenor vocal range lying between the C note one octave below middle C (C3) to the C note one octave above middle C (C5)! This means that it would lie just slightly below the Countertenor voice, but has similar characteristics in the sense that the Tenor would also be able to sing most high notes with ease and vocalize the head voice notes with strength and brightness! [PAR] The Tenor voice would probably transition into his middle voice around the D or E note above middle C (D4 or E4) and shift into head voice around the F sharp or G above middle C (F4 or G4). The tenor tessitura would lie between that of the Countertenor\u2019s and the Baritone\u2019s. Do make sure that we avoid certain common singing problems like jaw tightness when we attempt to find out where our vocal register transitions lie, as this will affect the notes at which we transition, affecting the voice type we may classify ourselves to be! [PAR] Famous Tenor voices include the 3 Tenors \u2013 Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as well as other classical singers like Enrico Caruso and pop singers like Elton John, Stevie Wonder. In the Mandarin pop scene, JJ Lin Junjie and Jay Chou would probably be considered Tenor voices too! [PAR] 3. BARITONE [PAR] Most men would have a vocal range similar to that of a Baritone voice, as this is the most common of the male voice types! A typical Baritone Voice Range would be between the A flat note one",

The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and non-magical people (Muggles). [PAR] Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 30 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.  The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. , the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release. [PAR] The series was originally published in English by two major publishers, Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. A play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, based on a story by Rowling, premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre, and its script was published by Little, Brown as the eighth book in the series.  The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures, which has become the second highest-grossing film series of all time . The franchise has also generated much tie-in merchandise, making the Harry Potter brand worth in excess of $15\u00a0billion.  [PAR] A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming of age and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme is death.  Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness. [PAR] The success of the books and films has ensured that the Harry Potter franchise continues to expand, with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premi\u00e8red in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a trilogy of spin-off films premi\u00e8ring in November 2016, among many other developments. Most recently, themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.

The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation, that lies ahead, in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.

[PAR] On his first day at school Bernard crossed swords with caretaker Norman Potter (Deryck Guyler), a former Desert Rat with delusions of grandeur, although with some credibility as he was the right hand man of incompetent headmaster, Maurice Cromwell (Noel Howlett), who in turn was the subject of infatuation by formidable deputy head Doris Ewell (Joan Sanderson). This trio virtually ran the school much to the resignation of the rest of the disillusioned staff and the last thing they wanted to disturb the balance was a young schoolmaster fresh out of teachers training college and full of bright ideals about modern teaching. [PAR] In order to curb Bernard's na\u00efve enthusiasm it was conspired between the trio to give him a class of 'no-hopers', namely 5C. In their last year at school the pupils of this class were an uneducable bunch of delinquents who were simply biding their time until the final bell sounded on the last day of term. This of course did not involve participating in any school activities such as lessons. However, through a series of (comical) events Bernard managed to win over not only the staff but also the class of pupils (who nicknamed him 'Privet' Hedges) that contained 'hard case' Patrick Duffy (Peter Cleall), the tough talking but wimpish Frankie (Hank) Abbott (David Barry), slow witted Dennis Dunstable (Peter Denyer), flirtatious Sharon (Penny Spencer in the first two season's, Carol Hawkins thereafter), and Maureen (Liz Gebhart), who had a crush on her teacher. Support on the teacher front came from Richard Davies who gave a first class performance as the down to earth no-nonsense Welsh science teacher, Mr Price, and the aging Eric Chitty as Mr Smith, a teacher that was clearly beyond retirement age at the series outset. In fact most of the actors who played the students were already in their twenties when Please Sir! began in 1968 and two years later (at the end of the longest last year in school history) the pupils were clearly showing their age. [PAR] The series made stars of several actors although oddly none of the students found lasting television fame. LWT Head of Light Entertainment, Frank Muir, cast Alderton as Bernard Hedges after he had spotted him as a teacher in the opening episode of Never A Cross Word. After leaving Fenn Street School the actor went on to several successful series such as Upstairs, Downstairs, it's spin-off series Thomas and Sarah, the LWT sitcom No-Honestly and a series of Wodehouse plays (Wodehouse Playhouse) for BBC (all of which Alderton co-starred alongside his wife, Pauline Collins), and the BBC sitcom My Wife Next Door with Hannah Gordon. Joan Sanderson won television immortality as Mrs Richards, the hotel guest with hearing problems in Fawlty Towers and after Please Sir! had finished she teamed up again with Deryck Guyler (who was originally cast as Fenn Street's headmaster) on a BBC radio show (also penned by the same writers), You're Only Young Once. [PAR] A 1971 feature movie was released in which Bernard meets and begins to date Penny Wheeler (Jill Kerman), and this was carried on in subsequent TV series of Please Sir! and its predecessor, The Fenn Street Gang (which in turn spawned Bowler), which briefly followed the fortunes of the pupils after they left school. [PAR] The series was the creation of former school chums and a new-to-television comedy writing team of John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, who went on to write Get Some In!; Ever Decreasing Circles; As Time Goes By and the enormously successful The Good Life.

Together with then-US President George W. Bush, he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq, an act which remains highly controversial.   [PAR] From 1983 to 2007, Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith. Under Blair's leadership, the party used the phrase \"New Labour\", to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism. Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as \"social-ism\", involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, and advocated social justice, cohesion, equal worth of each citizen, and equal opportunity.  Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism.  [PAR] In May 1997, the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory, the largest in its history, allowing Blair, at 43 years old, to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. In September 1997, Blair attained early personal popularity, receiving a 93% public approval rating, after his public response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.    The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership: in 2001, in which it won another landslide victory, and in 2005, with a reduced majority. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act, and Freedom of Information Act. Blair's government also carried out the devolution, the establishing of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto. In Northern Ireland, Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. [PAR] Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration, and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and, more controversially, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq, including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression.  In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary. [PAR] Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007, and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown.  On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East, which he held until 27 May 2015.

Extending across the entirety of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. [PAR] The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century.  The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland in Europe to Alaska in North America.

It is not Shakespeare\u2019s only play that features a move from the court to the woods \u2013 A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream and Timon of Athens do the same \u2013 but in As You Like It the forest takes on a special role as a place of inversion, cross-dressing and unsettled gender roles. The escape from the court changes the characters and creates a space of sexual freedom and chaos, where women take control and men learn lessons in romance. In the comedies, the forest becomes a distorted version of the court where social rules are broken, creating a sense of jovial confusion before a return to civilisation in the final act. [PAR] \u2018Gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time [PAR] carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\u2019 Act 1.1 [PAR] The forest can be defined as a 'pastoral space\u2019 that represents the opposite of urban life in the play, representing the division between the city and the country that was beginning to emerge in Shakespeare\u2019s time. The country was often seen as a place of nostalgia for a simpler time, as shown in Duke Senior\u2019s forest court that echoes tales of Robin Hood. The merry court of the forest is an inversion of the court at the beginning of the play, far from the threats of violence and cruel treatment of Duke Frederick. Danger in the forest of As You Like It is never truly life-threatening but, when considering the role of the forest in other plays such as Titus Andronicus, the possibility of violence draws a long shadow over the plot. [PAR] 'Alas, what danger will it be to us, [PAR] Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\u2019 Act 1.3 [PAR] When Rosalind and Celia decide to enter the forest, they must put on disguises as 'beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\u2019 (1.3) The threat of displaying beauty is underscored by the reputation forests had during Shakespeare\u2019s time as spaces where vagrants lived outside society, presenting a danger of sexual violence for women who wandered there alone. For wealthy women, such as Rosalind and Celia, the threat would be even more pronounced as they would be visibly affluent in a place of extreme poverty, fuelling Celia\u2019s decision to dress in 'poor and mean attire\u2019. (1.3) The forest of Arden is a place of comedy but underlying the play is a sense of unspoken danger, drawing on the role of the forest as a place of tragedy and violence that it assumes in Shakespeare\u2019s other plays.

By leaving the court she leaves behind the pressures of being a noblewoman and is able to express her desire for Orlando, albeit while dressed as a man. That Rosalind must cross-dress in order to express her desires is evidence that the forest can only allow so much freedom: the woman may take control, but only while others believe she is male. Rosalind engages with Orlando in a way that can be seen as homoerotic, creating both the sexual and gender confusion that permeates the forest. Her disguise frees her from womanhood but entraps her in masculinity, meaning she cannot marry Orlando unless she returns to presenting as female. Gender never truly breaks down in the forest, showing how the pastoral space is still linked to societal values that render women subordinate, values that Rosalind plays into when declaring women 'apish, shallow, inconstant.\u2019 (3.2) [PAR] 'The duke hath put on a religious life",

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Four Feather FallsFour Feather Falls was the third puppet TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for  Granada Television. It was based on an idea by Barry Gray, who also wrote the show's music. The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's Supermarionation puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a sheriff. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the Indian chief Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, and two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog. [PAR] Tex's speaking voice was provided by Nicholas Parsons, and his singing voice by Michael Holliday. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005. [PAR] Production [PAR] American Western television shows such as Wagon Train and Gunsmoke were popular with British audiences, therefore Gerry Anderson and his business partner Arthur Provis decided to make a cowboy series, based on an idea offered to them by Barry Gray. Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by Christine Glanville for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the Supermarionation puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, Supercar. [PAR] The puppets' papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow fibre glass heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated solenoids, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue. The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in Four Feather Falls had oversized heads. [PAR] Except for the pilot episode, which was made in AP Films' studios at Islet Park, the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the Slough Trading Estate. The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later. The show was filmed in black and white.  Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated special effects, and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of muzzle flashes, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the 35 mm negatives so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of tungsten, an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the puppeteers on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving. [PAR] Continuity for the series was provided by Sylvia Thamm who married Gerry Anderson. [PAR] Plot [PAR] The series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century Western town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its sheriff, Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry Indian boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised), and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak.

The first documented Olympic champion was a man named Coroebus, a cook from Elis who won the sprint race in 776 BC. Historians believe that the games had already existed for at least 500 years prior to that date. The Olympic Games originally featured only one event: a race called the \"stade\", equal to a distance of about 210 yards. By 728 BC two additional races had been added, comparable to the 400 meter and 1,500 meter races of the modern games. The Olympics came to include wrestling, boxing and the pentathlon, as well as specialized events for soldiers and heralds. It was only in 472 BC that the events were spread out over a period of four to five days, previously they had all taken place on a single day. Participation in the Olympic Games was originally limited to free born Greeks, but as Greek civilization was spread by the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Games drew entrants from as far away as Antioch, Sidon and Alexandria. While the only official prize was a wreath or garland, successful athletes were supported by the governments of their cities and devoted much time to training. Most of the competitors were, in fact, professionals. After the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century BC, the Olympic Games suffered a decline in popularity and importance, but the Games persisted until AD 393, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered their abolition. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated with Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29 year old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The Games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Games, held in London in a newly built 66,000 seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more then 2,500 competitors from 28countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No Games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the Games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the1928 Games in Amsterdam there were more than 290 women among the 3,000athletes, more than double the number that took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing and a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the Games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, where Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village. Sixty nations boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while the Soviets and",

[PAR] After the sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, the great ship slumbered on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean for over 70 years before its wreckage was discovered. On September 1, 1985, a joint American-French expedition, headed by famous American oceanographer Dr. Robert Ballard, found the Titanic over two miles below the ocean\u2019s surface by using an unmanned submersible called Argo. This discovery gave new meaning to the Titanic\u2019s sinking and gave birth to new dreams in ocean exploration. [PAR] The Titanic\u2019s Journey [PAR] Built in Ireland from 1909 to 1912 on behalf of the British-owned White Star Line, the Titanic officially left its final European port of Queenstown, Ireland on April 11, 1912. Carrying over 2,200 passengers and crew, the Titanic began its maiden voyage across the Atlantic, headed for New York. [PAR] The Titanic carried passengers from all walks of life. Tickets were sold to first, second, and third class passengers; the latter group largely consisting of immigrants seeking a better life. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Famous first class passengers included the Astors, the Strausses, J. Bruce Ismay, and Benjamin Guggenheim. [PAR] The Sinking of the Titanic [PAR] Only three days after setting sail, the Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on April 14, 1912, somewhere in the North Atlantic. Although it took the ship over two and a half hours to sink, the vast majority of the crew and passengers perished due to a significant lack of lifeboats and improper use of those that did exist. The lifeboats could have held over 1,100 people, but only 705 people were saved; nearly 1,500 perished the night the Titanic sank. [PAR] People around the world were shocked when they heard that the \u201cunsinkable\u201d Titanic had sunk. They wanted to know the details of the disaster. Yet, however much the survivors could share, theories about how and why the Titanic sank would remain unsubstantiated until the wreckage of the great ship could be found. There was just one problem -- no one was sure exactly where the Titanic had sunk. [PAR] Robert Ballard [PAR] Robert Ballard wanted to find the wreckage of the Titanic. Ballard had grown up in San Diego, California, near the ocean, where he began his life-long fascination with the ocean and learned to scuba dive. After graduating from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965 with degrees in both chemistry and geology, Ballard signed up for the Army. Two years later, in 1967, Ballard transferred to the Navy, where he was assigned to the Deep Submergence Group at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Research Institution in Massachusetts, thus beginning his illustrious career with submersibles. [PAR] By 1974, Ballard had received two doctoral degrees (marine geology and geophysics) from the University of Rhode Island and had spent a lot of time conducting deep water dives in a manned submersible he helped design, called Alvin. During subsequent dives in 1977 and 1979 near the Galapagos Rift, Ballard helped discover hydrothermal vents . More importantly, though, were the amazing plants that grew around these vents; it was the scientific study of these plants that led to the discovery of chemosynthesis , a process in which plants use chemical reactions rather than sunlight to get energy.

He is a pompous, blustering figure with overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager, and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He believes in following rules and orders to sometimes ludicrous degrees. He is class conscious and a snob, considering himself upper-middle class and looking down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. His pretensions stand in contrast to Wilson , who is genuinely Upper Middle Class, Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's having attending public school, believing it made him 'wet', while his own state-school background is an attribute. Mainwaring and Wilson's relationship is mainly based on the fact that Mainwaring has always had to struggle and fight for everything in his life, whereas Wilson has just sat back and let it all come to him, (despite being a strong autocrat, Mainwaring fully believes that people should work and earn everything they get in life). Mainwaring is prudish and repressed, and can be judgemental about people who do not share his moral outlook. [PAR] Mainwaring [PAR] Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those he considers beneath him, and his arrogance is frequently punctured by circumstance and the people around him, such as Arthur Wilson , his chief clerk with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship, and Private Walker , a black-marketeer who interjects during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefitting from underhanded deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not, and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. [PAR] As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he is barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, and his plans result in chaos. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain of World War I. (In World War II, John Le Mesurier who played Wilson, had been a Captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major). He did, however, serve in the army of occupation in France, \"during the whole of 1919 \u2014 somebody had to clear up the mess.\" (He tried to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight; Arthur Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to World War II but was also rejected with poor eyesight.) [PAR] Despite his shortcomings as a leader, Mainwaring considers himself an excellent military tactician. His height and background is frequently demonstrated to show a Napoleon Complex; he is frequently referred to as 'Napoleon' by his nemesis Hodges . In one episode, A Soldier's Farewell , Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte , and is thwarted at the Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington looking like Wilson. His pomposity and conviction of his prowess see Mainwaring yearn to be in control of any situation, and he behaves in an arrogant manner; this is demonstrated by the first episode, in which he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience or qualifications (and had to wait until the episode Room at the Bottom before he received his commission). [PAR] In Command Decision he was prepared to relinquish control so the platoon could gain rifles, arguing defence of the country was more important than his ego. In addition he was prepared to \"march in the ranks as Private Mainwaring\" when he was briefly de-commissioned. This implied he was more overzealous than a control freak. [PAR] Mainwaring's patriotism can lead to xenophobia (he is not keen on the French because they are emotional, the Russians because their communism, and the Germans and the Italians because of them being such deadly enemies).

In addition the Austrian Empire possessed numbers of irregular light troops; Hussars from Hungary and Bosniak and Pandour troops from the Balkans.

Its 39 half-hour episodes were originally screened on ITV in the United Kingdom and in syndication in Canada and the United States. The scriptwriters included the Andersons, Alan Fennell, and Dennis Spooner. Barry Gray composed the music, and Derek Meddings served as special effects director. [PAR] Stingray was the first Supermarionation production in which the marionette characters had interchangeable heads featuring a variety of expressions. It was also the first British television series to be filmed entirely in colour over its production run. [PAR] Plot [PAR] Stingray, a highly sophisticated combat submarine built for speed and manoeuvrability, is the flag vessel of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a security organisation based at Marineville in the year 2065.  It is capable of speeds of up to 600 kn, while advanced pressure compensators allow it to submerge to depths of over 36000 ft, enabling cruising to the bottom of any part of any of the Earth's oceans. Marineville is located somewhere in California, on the West Coast of the United States. In the case of it being under attack, battle stations is sounded and all the buildings and vehicles are sent down on hydraulic jacks into the safety of underground bunkers, protected by enormous steel and concrete shutters whilst missiles are deployed from underground silos and fighter jets are launched. The base lies 10 mi inland, and Stingray is launched from \"Pen 3\" through a tunnel leading to the Pacific Ocean. The alerts \"action stations\", \"launch stations\", and \"battle stations\" are sounded by a rapid drum-beat (composed and recorded by series composer Barry Gray) that is played over Marineville's public address system. Commands given by radio are acknowledged with the acronym: P.W.O.R. which stands for, \"Proceeding With Orders Received\". [PAR] The pilot of Stingray is the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest (whose Supermarionation puppet was modelled on actor James Garner). He is paired with Dixie navigator Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed \"Phones\" for his role as Stingray's hydrophone operator. (Phones' real name, George Sheridan, is referred to in the series' publicity material but is not mentioned on-screen.) Troy and Phones board Stingray by sitting on twin injector seats in Marineville's stand-by lounge, which are sent down rapidly into the vessel through injector tubes and clamped down into place. They answer to the crusty \"hoverchair\"-bound Commander Samuel Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, is enamoured of Troy. The reason for Shore's disability is revealed in the episode \"The Ghost of the Sea\": as a security agent for a deep-sea mining platform, he was injured when a hostile submersible attacked the facility and damaged his patrol craft. He managed to ram the enemy in return, and then escape to the surface, but in so doing lost the use of his legs. Sub-Lieutenant John Horatio Fisher also regularly takes shifts in the Marineville control room. [PAR] During the course of the series, Stingray encounters a number of undersea races, both friendly and hostile. The Aquaphibians, an aquatic warrior race, appear regularly\u2014usually under the command of King Titan (modelled on Laurence Olivier), who is the tyrannical ruler of the underwater city of Titanica. In the pilot episode, Stingray is attacked by Titan's forces and Troy and Phones are captured. They are rescued by Titan's slave girl, Marina (modelled on Brigitte Bardot),  a mute young woman who can breathe underwater. Troy immediately becomes infatuated with Marina, causing Atlanta to become jealous. Titan, meanwhile, swears revenge for Marina's betrayal. Marina becomes a regular member of Stingray's crew, and later acquires a pet seal pup named Oink, who appears in a number of episodes. [PAR] Many later episodes revolve around Titan's schemes to destroy Stingray and Marineville. These often fail due to the incompetence of his spy on land, Surface Agent X20 who lives on the Island of Lemoy (whose likeness is modelled on Claude",

[PAR] There are many vocal ranges and voice types for males, and this section will discuss the 4 main types of male voices, their respective pitch ranges, unique tonal characteristics, as well as how their tessituras or most comfortable voice ranges differ from each other. [PAR] One important point to note: These 2 terms \u2013 Vocal Range and Voice Type \u2013 are not to be confused with each other. [PAR] The Range of our Voice refers to the range of notes that our voice can reach or produce a sound at, whereas the Type of Voice refers to the various kinds of voices classified using certain criteria like range of vocals, tessituras, register transition points, vocal timbre or tone and so on. [PAR] Click on the links provided above to understand more about how to find your own vocal range, as well as how to determine your own voice type using the various criteria! [PAR] Now, the 4 main types of male voices are as follows: [PAR] 1. Countertenor [PAR] Let us look at each of these male voices in more detail: [PAR] 1. COUNTERTENOR [PAR] The Countertenor Voice may actually be unfamiliar to those of us not from the classical realm, as many of us would probably only have heard of the 3 main male voices \u2013 Tenor, Baritone and Bass. [PAR] The Countertenor voice is the highest of the adult male voice types, and has a vocal range that is similar to that of the Female Contralto Voice, the lowest of the female voice types! In the Mandarin pop scene, certain singers like Jeff Chang and the lead singer of popular pop rock band Soda Green would probably qualify as countertenor voices! [PAR] An approximate Countertenor Vocal Range would be from a G note below the middle C (G3) to a high F one octave above the middle C (F5). Be sure to support your voice well with your breath so as to get a more accurate representation of the range in your voice. Check out the section on \u2018How to Find Your Singing Range and Voice Type\u2019 to get some tips on finding your range on your own! [PAR] Also, the Tessitura or most comfortable singing range for Countertenors lies above that of the Tenor and other adult male voices. The Countertenor voice would usually be able to sing the high head voice notes with great ease and brightness in tone, and would often be confused by many listeners with regular female voices. [PAR] 2. TENOR [PAR] The Tenor Voice is the highest of the main male vocal types that most people would be familiar with, with the typical tenor vocal range lying between the C note one octave below middle C (C3) to the C note one octave above middle C (C5)! This means that it would lie just slightly below the Countertenor voice, but has similar characteristics in the sense that the Tenor would also be able to sing most high notes with ease and vocalize the head voice notes with strength and brightness! [PAR] The Tenor voice would probably transition into his middle voice around the D or E note above middle C (D4 or E4) and shift into head voice around the F sharp or G above middle C (F4 or G4). The tenor tessitura would lie between that of the Countertenor\u2019s and the Baritone\u2019s. Do make sure that we avoid certain common singing problems like jaw tightness when we attempt to find out where our vocal register transitions lie, as this will affect the notes at which we transition, affecting the voice type we may classify ourselves to be! [PAR] Famous Tenor voices include the 3 Tenors \u2013 Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, as well as other classical singers like Enrico Caruso and pop singers like Elton John, Stevie Wonder. In the Mandarin pop scene, JJ Lin Junjie and Jay Chou would probably be considered Tenor voices too! [PAR] 3. BARITONE [PAR] Most men would have a vocal range similar to that of a Baritone voice, as this is the most common of the male voice types! A typical Baritone Voice Range would be between the A flat note one",

[PAR] The Channel Tunnel, often called the Chunnel, is a railway tunnel that lies underneath the water of the English Channel and connects the island of Great Britain with mainland France. The Channel Tunnel , completed in 1994, is considered one of the most amazing engineering feats of the 20th century. [PAR] Dates: Officially opened on May 6, 1994 [PAR] Also Known As: The Chunnel, the Euro Tunnel [PAR] Overview of the Channel Tunnel: [PAR] For centuries, crossing the English Channel via boat or ferry had been considered a miserable task. The often inclement weather and choppy water could make even the most seasoned traveler seasick. It is perhaps not surprising then that as early as 1802 plans were being made for an alternate route across the English Channel. [PAR] Early Plans [PAR] This first plan, made by French engineer Albert Mathieu Favier, called for a tunnel to be dug under the water of the English Channel. This tunnel was to be large enough for horse-drawn carriages to travel through. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] 10 Best Universities in the United States [PAR] Although Favier was able to get the backing of French leader Napoleon Bonaparte , the British rejected Favier's plan. (The British feared, perhaps correctly, that Napoleon wanted to build the tunnel in order to invade England.) [PAR] Over the next two centuries, others created plans to connect Great Britain with France. Despite progress made on a number of these plans, including actual drilling, they all eventually fell through. Sometimes the reason was political discord, other times is was financial problems. Still other times it was Britain's fear of invasion. All of these factors had to be solved before the Channel Tunnel could be built. [PAR] A Contest [PAR] In 1984, French president Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher jointly agreed that a link across the English Channel would be mutually beneficial. However, both governments realized that although the project would create much needed jobs, neither country's government could fund such a massive project. Thus, they decided to hold a contest. [PAR] This contest invited companies to submit their plans to create a link across the English Channel. As part of the contest's requirements, the submitting company was to provide a plan to raise the needed funds to build the project, have the ability to operate the proposed Channel link once the project was completed, and the proposed link must be able to endure for at least 120 years. [PAR] Ten proposals were submitted, including various tunnels and bridges. Some of the proposals were so outlandish in design that they were easily dismissed; others would be so expensive that they were unlikely to ever be completed. The proposal that was accepted was the plan for the Channel Tunnel, submitted by the Balfour Beatty Construction Company (this later became Transmanche Link). [PAR] The Design for the Channel Tunnels [PAR] The Channel Tunnel was to be made up of two, parallel railway tunnels that would be dug under the English Channel. Between these two railway tunnels would run a third, smaller tunnel that would be used for maintenance, including drainage pipes, communication cables, drainage pipes, etc. [PAR] Each of the trains that would run through the Chunnel would be able to hold cars and trucks. This would enable personal vehicles to go through the Channel Tunnel without having individual drivers face such a long, underground drive. [PAR] The plan was expected to cost $3.6 billion. [PAR] Getting Started [PAR] Just getting started on the Channel Tunnel was a monumental task. Funds had to be raised (over 50 large banks gave loans), experienced engineers had to be found, 13,000 skilled and unskilled workers had to be hired and housed, and special tunnel boring machines had to be designed and built. [PAR] As these things were getting done, the designers had to determine exactly where the tunnel was to be dug. Specifically, the geology of the bottom of the English Channel had to be carefully examined. It was determined that although the bottom was made of a thick layer of chalk, the Lower",

His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide. [PAR] Born in Wales to Norwegian parents, Dahl served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, in which he became a flying ace and intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander. He rose to prominence in the 1940s with works for both children and adults and he became one of the world's best-selling authors. He has been referred to as \"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\". His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008, The Times placed Dahl 16th on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". [PAR] Dahl's short stories are known for their unexpected endings and his children's books for their unsentimental, macabre, often darkly comic content, featuring villainous adult enemies of the child characters.  His books champion the kind-hearted, and feature an underlying warm sentiment. Dahl's works for children include James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda,  The Witches, Fantastic Mr Fox, The BFG, The Twits and George's Marvellous Medicine. His adult works include Tales of the Unexpected. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Childhood  [PAR] Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (n\u00e9e Hesselberg).  Dahl's father had emigrated to the UK from Sarpsborg, Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s. His mother came over and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after the Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild and Else. Dahl and his sisters were raised in the Lutheran faith, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff, where their parents worshipped.  [PAR] In 1920, when Dahl was three years old, his seven-year-old sister, Astri, died from appendicitis. Weeks later, his father died of pneumonia at the age of 57. With the option of returning to Norway to live with relatives, Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales, because Harald had wished to have their children educated in British schools, which he considered the world's best.  [PAR] Dahl first attended the Cathedral School, Llandaff. At the age of eight, he and four of his friends (one named Thwaites) were caned by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of gobstoppers at the local sweet shop, which was owned by a \"mean and loathsome\" old woman called Mrs Pratchett. This was known among the five boys as the \"Great Mouse Plot of 1924\".  A favourite sweet among British schoolboys between the two World Wars, Dahl would later refer to gobstoppers in his literary creation, Everlasting Gobstopper.  [PAR] Thereafter, he transferred to a boarding school in England: St Peter's in Weston-super-Mare. Roald's parents had wanted him to be educated at an English public school and, because of a then regular ferry link across the Bristol Channel, this proved to be the nearest. His time at St Peter's was an unpleasant experience for him. He was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed to her his unhappiness. Only after her death in 1967 did he find out that she had saved every single one of his letters, in small bundles held together with green tape.  In 2016, to mark the centenary of Dahl's birth, his letters to his mother were abridged and broadcast as BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week.  Dahl wrote about his time at St Peter's in his autobiography Boy: Tales of Childhood.  [PAR] Repton School  [PAR] From 1929, he attended Repton School in Derbyshire. Dahl had",

[PAR] Related Topics [PAR] Betsy Ross [PAR] After the American Revolution began, the first unofficial national flag\u2014known as the Continental Colours (or, incorrectly, as the Grand Union Flag or the Cambridge Flag)\u2014was hoisted at Prospect Hill in Charlestown (now in Somerville, Mass.) on Jan. 1, 1776; it was raised, it appears, at the behest of Gen. George Washington , whose headquarters were nearby. The flag had 13 horizontal stripes (probably of red and white or of red, white, and blue) and, in the canton, the first version of the British Union Flag ( Union Jack ). It was used at forts and on naval vessels. Another popular early flag, that of the Sons of Liberty , had the 13 stripes only. The various 18th-century \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flags had only local significance, but in the 20th century such designs were popularized by political protesters. [PAR] The first official national flag, formally approved by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, was the Stars and Stripes. The blue canton was to contain 13 stars, but the layout of the stars was left undefined, and several patterns are known. The designer of the flag, Congressman Francis Hopkinson , may have had a ring of stars in mind to symbolize (in the words of the flag law) \u201ca new constellation.\u201d Today that pattern is popularly known as the \u201c Betsy Ross flag,\u201d although the claims of her descendants that she made the first Stars and Stripes and that she used the ring pattern are unsubstantiated. Rows of stars (4-5-4 or 3-2-3-2-3) were common, but other variations also existed. The new Stars and Stripes formed part of the military colours carried on Sept. 11, 1777, at the Battle of the Brandywine , perhaps its first such use. [PAR] Similar Topics [PAR] flag of the Confederate States of America [PAR] The Stars and Stripes changed on May 1, 1795, when two more stars and two more stripes were added to reflect the admission to the union of Vermont (1791) and Kentucky (1792). (One such flag was the 1,260-square-foot [117-square-metre] \u201cStar-Spangled Banner,\u201d made by Mary Pickersgill, that Francis Scott Key saw at Fort McHenry in September 1814, inspiring his patriotic poem .) In 1818, after five more states had been admitted, Congress enacted legislation pertaining to a new flag, requiring that henceforth the number of stripes should remain 13, the number of stars should always match the number of states, and any new star should be added on the July 4 following a state\u2019s admission. This has been the system ever since. In all, from 1777 to 1960 (after the admission of Hawaii in 1959) there were 27 versions of the flag\u201425 involving changes in the stars only. An executive order of Oct. 29, 1912, standardized the proportions and relative sizes of the elements of the flag; in 1934 the exact shades of colour were standardized. [PAR] There is no official assignment of meaning or symbolism to the colours of the flag. However, Charles Thomson , secretary of the Continental Congress, in describing the proposed Great Seal, suggested the following symbolism: \u201cWhite signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness & valour, and Blue\u2026signifies vigilence, perseverence [sic] & justice.\u201d As with many other national flags, the Stars and Stripes has long been a focus of patriotic sentiment .

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n\n### Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nThe provided context is an excerpt from SparkNotes: Animal Farm, focusing on the character list. The analysis of each character offers insight into the themes of power, manipulation, and the decline of ideals in the novel. Mollie, the vain and flighty mare, is of particular interest as she represents the petit bourgeoisie and their relationship with the working class.\n\n### Concept Exploration\n\nThe concept of the petit bourgeoisie is crucial to understanding Mollie's character. The petit bourgeoisie is a social class situated between the working class and the bourgeoisie. They often identify with the values of the working class but aspire to the privileges of the bourgeoisie. Mollie's desire for attention, grooming, and pampering reflects her identification with the bourgeoisie, while her initial reluctance to adapt to life on Animal Farm and her nostalgia for her old life represent her connection to the working class.\n\n### Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI rate the difficulty of this topic a 9 out of 10. The concept of the petit bourgeoisie and its relationship with the working class requires a deep understanding of Marxist theory and the social dynamics of the Russian Revolution.

    "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Scotland during the Roman EmpireScotland during the Roman Empire refers to the protohistorical period during which the Roman Empire interacted with the area that is now Scotland, which was known to them as \"Caledonia\". Roman legions arrived around \u00a071, having conquered the Celtic tribes of \"Britain\" (England and Wales) over the preceding three decades. Aiming to annex all of the island of \"Albion\", Romans under Q.\u00a0Petillius Cerialis and Gn.\u00a0Julius Agricola invaded the Caledonians in the 70s and 80s. An account by Agricola's son-in-law Tacitus mentions a Roman victory at \"Mons Graupius\" which became the namesake of the Grampians but has been questioned by modern scholarship. The Romans then seem to have repeated an earlier Greek circumnavigation of the island and received submission from local tribes, establishing their border of actual control first along the Gask Ridge before withdrawing to a line south of the Solway Firth. This line was fortified as Hadrian's Wall. Several Roman commanders attempted to fully conquer lands north of this line, including a brief expansion that was fortified as the Antonine Wall. Despite grandiose claims made by an 18th-century forged manuscript, however, it is now believed that the Romans at no point controlled even half of present-day Scotland and that Roman legions ceased to affect the area after around 211. [PAR] The history of the period is complex and not well-documented. The province of Valentia, for instance, may have been the lands between the two Roman walls, or the territory around and south of Hadrian's Wall, or Roman Wales. Romans held most of their Caledonian territory only a little over 40 years; they probably only held any Scottish land at all for about 80 years. Some Scottish historians such as Moffat go so far as to say Rome's presence was entirely uninfluential. \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" proper would not emerge as unified ideas until centuries later. In fact, the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period: by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons. The Scoti, Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name, had begun to settle along the west coast as well. All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367. The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives. The most enduring legacies of Rome, however, were Christianity and literacy, both of which arrived indirectly via Irish missionaries. [PAR] The dawn of Scottish history [PAR] Scotland had been inhabited for thousands of years before the Romans arrived. However, it is only during the Greco-Roman period that Scotland is recorded in writing. [PAR] The work On the Cosmos by Aristotle or Pseudo-Aristotle mentions two \"very large\" British Isles called Albion (Great Britain) and Ierne (Ireland). The Greek explorer and geographer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285\u00a0 and may have circumnavigated the mainland, which he describes as being triangular in shape. In his work On the Ocean, he refers to the most northerly point as ' (Orkney).  [PAR] The earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of 11 British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in \u00a043 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.   The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance is striking.  Originals of On the Ocean do not survive, but copies are known to have existed in the 1st century so at the least a rudimentary knowledge of the geography of north Britain would have been available to Roman military intelligence.   Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his De Chorographia, written around \u00a043, that there were 30 Orkney islands and seven Haemodae (possibly Shetland).Breeze, David J.",

The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas drew on a regular group of actors, the Carry On team, that included Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas and Jim Dale. [PAR] The Carry On series contains the largest number of films of any British series; and, next to the James Bond films, it is the second-longest continually running UK film series although with a fourteen-year break (1978\u201392). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced twelve films (1958\u201366), and the Rank Organisation made the remaining nineteen (1967\u201392). [PAR] Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u201362) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u201374). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975 and various West End stage shows which later toured the regions. [PAR] All the films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late-1960s (at the height of the franchise's success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Mount Snowdon acting as the Khyber Pass in Carry On Up the Khyber), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in Follow That Camel. [PAR] Background [PAR] \"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) was about a group of recruits on National Service and was in keeping with its setting, the titular order commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961,\"Carry On Regardless\". [PAR] The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of Music Hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Carry On Spying\") and Hammer Horror (\"Carry On Screaming\"). The most impressive of these was Carry On Cleo (1964), after the  Burton and Taylor epic Cleopatra (1963), where the budget-conscious Carry On team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. (\"Carry On Emmanuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original straight 'run'.) [PAR] The stock-in-trade of Carry On humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the National Health Service (Nurse, Doctor, Again Doctor, Matron), the monarchy (Henry), the Empire (Up the Khyber), the armed forces (Sergeant) and the trade unions (At Your Convenience) as well as the Hammer horror film (Screaming), camping (Camping), foreigners (Abroad), beauty contests (Girls), and caravan holidays (Behind) among others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they proved very popular with audiences.

[PAR] Malachite Gemstones: A malachite cabochon (30x40 millimeter) and a malachite puffed heart, both cut from rough mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This oval cabochon shows the agate-like banding in various shades of green that is typical of malachite. The puffed heart shows concentric structures. [PAR] What is Malachite? [PAR] Malachite is a green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with a chemical composition of Cu2(CO3)(OH)2.  It was one of the first ores used to produce copper metal.  It is of minor importance today as an ore of copper because it is usually found in small quantities and can be sold for higher prices for other types of use. [PAR] Malachite has been used as a gemstone and sculptural material for thousands of years and is still popular today.  Today it is most often cut into cabochons or beads for jewelry use. [PAR] Malachite has a green color that does not fade over time or when exposed to light.  Those properties, along with its ability to be easily ground to a powder, made malachite a preferred pigment and coloring agent for thousands of years.

Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Where Does Malachite Form? [PAR] Malachite is a mineral that forms at shallow depths within the Earth, in the oxidizing zone above copper deposits. It precipitates from descending solutions in fractures, caverns, cavities, and the intergranular spaces of porous rock. It often forms within limestone where a subsurface chemical environment favorable for the formation of carbonate minerals can occur.  Associated minerals include azurite , bornite , calcite , chalcopyrite , copper , cuprite , and a variety of iron oxides. [PAR] Some of the first malachite deposits to be exploited were located in Egypt and Israel.  Over 4000 years ago, they were mined and used to produce copper.  Material from these deposits was also used to produce gemstones, sculptures, and pigments.  Several large deposits in the Ural Mountains of Russia were aggressively mined, and they supplied abundant gem and sculptural material in the 1800s.  Very little is produced from these deposits today.  Much of the  malachite entering the lapidary market today is from deposits in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Smaller amounts are produced in Australia, France, and Arizona. [PAR] Stalactitic malachite: A specimen of stalactitic malachite from the Kasompi Mine, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The specimen is approximately 21 x 16 x 12 centimeters in size. Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Physical Properties of Malachite [PAR] A minor ore of copper. Gemstones, small sculptures, pigment. [PAR] Physical Properties of Malachite [PAR] Malachite's most striking physical property is its green color.  All specimens of the mineral are green and range from a pastel green, to a bright green, to an extremely dark green that is almost black.  It is typically found as stalactites and botryoidal coatings on the surfaces of underground cavities - similar to the deposits of calcite found in caves.  When these materials are cut into slabs and pieces, the sawn surfaces often exhibit banding and eyes that are similar to agate . [PAR] Malachite is rarely found as a crystal, but when found, the crystals are usually acicular to tabular in shape.  The crystals are bright green in color, translucent, with a vitreous to adamantine luster.  Non-crystalline specimens are opaque, usually with a dull to earthy luster. [PAR] Malachite is a copper mineral, and that  gives malachite a high specific gravity that ranges from 3.6 to 4.0.  This property is so striking for a green mineral that malachite is easy to identify.

It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series were filmed, comprising a total of 32 episodes. Production ceased after Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television. [PAR] Set in the mid-2060s, Thunderbirds is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls, Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray. It follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from IR's secret base in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines. [PAR] Thunderbirds began its first run in the United Kingdom on the ITV network in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. As well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns, the series has been followed by two feature-length film sequels, a live-action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute. The second of two TV remakes, the computer-animated Thunderbirds Are Go, premiered in 2015. [PAR] Widely considered to be the Andersons' most popular and commercially successful series,  Thunderbirds has received particular praise for its effects (directed by Derek Meddings) and musical score (composed by Barry Gray). It is also well remembered for its title sequence, which opens with an often-quoted countdown by actor Peter Dyneley (who voiced the character of Jeff): \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1: Thunderbirds Are Go!\" A real-life rescue service, the International Rescue Corps, is named after the organisation featured in the series.

In 1829 he was graduated second in his class at West Point without having incurred a single demerit in his four years there. Commissioned in the Corps of Engineers, he served as a captain under General Winfield Scott in the Mexican War, in which he distinguished himself in the battles of Veracruz , Churubusco, and Chapultepec. He was slightly wounded in that war and earned three brevets to colonel. General Scott declared him to be \u201cthe very best soldier that I ever saw in the field.\u201d [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] Robert E. Lee graduated second in his class from West Point in 1829. He did not receive a single demerit during his four years at the academy. [PAR] In 1852 he was appointed superintendent of West Point. Three years later, with the approval of Jefferson Davis , then secretary of war, he transferred as a lieutenant colonel to the newly raised Second Cavalry and served in West Texas . [PAR] Although John Brown\u2019s raid on the U.S. Arsenal and Armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia ), in October 1859 occurred while Lee was at his home on extended leave in Arlington, Virginia, he was placed in command of a detachment of marines and, with Second Lieutenant J. E. B. Stuart, captured Brown and his band. [PAR] On April 20, 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War , he resigned his commission and three days later was appointed by Governor John Letcher of Virginia to be commander in chief of the military and naval forces of the state. When Virginia\u2019s troops were transferred to the Confederate service, he became, on May 14, 1861, a brigadier general, the highest rank then authorized. Soon after he was promoted to full general. [PAR] Lee\u2019s first field command was in the western part of the state, where he failed to hold back invading Union forces in an area of strong pro-Union sentiment. He was recalled to Richmond, and from March 1862 he was military adviser to President Davis. From this position he was able to influence some operations, notably those of General Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson in his Shenandoah Valley campaign. [PAR] When General Joseph E. Johnston was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31, Lee took command of what became the Army of Northern Virginia. He successfully repulsed the efforts of Union general George McClellan in the Peninsular campaign, concluding with the Battles of Seven Days: Oak Grove, Mechanicsville, Gaine\u2019s Mill, Garnett\u2019s and Golding\u2019s Farms, Savage\u2019s Station and Allen\u2019s Farm, White Oak Swamp, and Malvern Hill. Victories were won through Lee\u2019s aggressiveness and daring in the face of McClellan\u2019s timidity rather than by any comprehensive generalship on Lee\u2019s part, for he was unable to exercise control over his subordinate commanders, and the individual battles could be considered tactical defeats. [PAR] On August 29-30, he defeated General John Pope in the second Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), but when he invaded Maryland he was checked on September 17 by Union forces under McClellan at Antietam. Here, even after the bloodiest day of the entire war, Lee held on and was willing to fight on the same field another day. On December 13, he defeated General Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg, and it was here that he made the remark to General James Longstreet that many of his admirers have tried to explain away: \u201cIt is well war is so terrible\u2013we would grow too fond of it.\u201d Lee loved fighting a war. [PAR] Lee\u2019s most brilliantly fought battle was the defeat of Joseph Hooker at Chancellorsville on May 1-4, 1863. It is one of the most elemental rules of generalship, indeed one might feel it elemental common sense, that the general of a numerically inferior force refrain from dividing that force in the face of his enemy.

Although Lemuel Gulliver\u2019s vivid and detailed style of narration makes it clear that he is intelligent and well educated, his perceptions are na\u00efve and gullible. He has virtually no emotional life, or at least no awareness of it, and his comments are strictly factual. Indeed, sometimes his obsession with the facts of navigation, for example, becomes unbearable for us, as his fictional editor, Richard Sympson, makes clear when he explains having had to cut out nearly half of Gulliver\u2019s verbiage. Gulliver never thinks that the absurdities he encounters are funny and never makes the satiric connections between the lands he visits and his own home. Gulliver\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 makes the satire possible, as we pick up on things that Gulliver does not notice. [PAR] Read an in-depth analysis of Gulliver. [PAR] The emperor\u00a0-\u00a0 The ruler of Lilliput. Like all Lilliputians, the emperor is fewer than six inches tall. His power and majesty impress Gulliver deeply, but to us he appears both laughable and sinister. Because of his tiny size, his belief that he can control Gulliver seems silly, but his willingness to execute his subjects for minor reasons of politics or honor gives him a frightening aspect. He is proud of possessing the tallest trees and biggest palace in the kingdom, but he is also quite hospitable, spending a fortune on his captive\u2019s food. The emperor is both a satire of the autocratic ruler and a strangely serious portrait of political power. [PAR] The farmer\u00a0-\u00a0 Gulliver\u2019s first master in Brobdingnag. The farmer speaks to Gulliver, showing that he is willing to believe that the relatively tiny Gulliver may be as rational as he himself is, and treats him with gentleness. However, the farmer puts Gulliver on display around Brobdingnag, which clearly shows that he would rather profit from his discovery than converse with him as an equal. His exploitation of Gulliver as a laborer, which nearly starves Gulliver to death, seems less cruel than simpleminded. Generally, the farmer represents the average Brobdingnagian of no great gifts or intelligence, wielding an extraordinary power over Gulliver simply by virtue of his immense size. [PAR] Glumdalclitch\u00a0-\u00a0 The farmer\u2019s nine-year-old daughter, who is forty feet tall. Glumdalclitch becomes Gulliver\u2019s friend and nursemaid, hanging him to sleep safely in her closet at night and teaching him the Brobdingnagian language by day. She is skilled at sewing and makes Gulliver several sets of new clothes, taking delight in dressing him. When the queen discovers that no one at court is suited to care for Gulliver, she invites Glumdalclitch to live at court as his sole babysitter, a function she performs with great seriousness and attentiveness. To Glumdalclitch, Gulliver is basically a living doll, symbolizing the general status Gulliver has in Brobdingnag. [PAR] The queen\u00a0-\u00a0 The queen of Brobdingnag, who is so delighted by Gulliver\u2019s beauty and charms that she agrees to buy him from the farmer for 1,000 pieces of gold. Gulliver appreciates her kindness after the hardships he suffers at the farmer\u2019s and shows his usual fawning love for royalty by kissing the tip of her little finger when presented before her. She possesses, in Gulliver\u2019s words, \u201cinfinite\u201d wit and humor, though this description may entail a bit of Gulliver\u2019s characteristic flattery of superiors. The queen seems genuinely considerate, asking Gulliver whether he would consent to live at court instead of simply taking him in as a pet and inquiring into the reasons for his cold good-byes with the farmer. She is by no means a hero, but simply a pleasant, powerful person. [PAR] The king\u00a0-\u00a0 The king of Brobdingnag, who, in contrast to the emperor of Lilliput, seems to be a true intellectual, well versed in political science among other disciplines. While his wife has an intimate, friendly relationship with the diminutive visitor, the king\u2019s relation to Gulliver is limited to serious discussions about the history and institutions of Gulliver\u2019s native land.",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n\n## Thoughtful Content Examination\n\nThe provided context revolves around the character analysis of Lemuel Gulliver and various rulers he encounters in the novel 'Gulliver's Travels'. The analysis focuses on Gulliver's character, his perceptions, and his reactions to the absurdities he encounters. Additionally, the context delves into the characterization of the emperor of Lilliput, the farmer of Brobdingnag, Glumdalclitch, the queen of Brobdingnag, and the king of Brobdingnag. The characterization of these figures serves as a satire of politics and power.\n\n## Concept Exploration\n\nThe context explores the themes of intellectualism, power, and perception. The king of Brobdingnag, in particular, is portrayed as a true intellectual, well-versed in political science.

On the other hand, the emperor of Lilliput is depicted as a ruler who believes in his own power and majesty, despite being physically small. This dichotomy between the two rulers highlights the complexities of power and perception.\n\n## Strategic Complexity Calibration\n\nI rate the difficulty of this topic as 8 out of 10.
