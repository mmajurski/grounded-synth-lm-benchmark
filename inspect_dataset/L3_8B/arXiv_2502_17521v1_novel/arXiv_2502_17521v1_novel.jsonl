In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string. There is ongoing debate about whether such syntactic transformations constitute true data contamination, as it is challenging to distinguish between an LLM\u2019s ability to recall memorized information and its reasoning capability during inference. In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring that benchmarks provide an accurate and reliable measure of an LLM\u2019s true ability to handle novel and unseen data.\n",

If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

    "context": "###### Examples of each contamination\nWe provide contamination examples in Table\u00a01. In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string. There is ongoing debate about whether such syntactic transformations constitute true data contamination, as it is challenging to distinguish between an LLM\u2019s ability to recall memorized information and its reasoning capability during inference. In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

    "context": "###### Examples of each contamination\nWe provide contamination examples in Table\u00a01. In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string. There is ongoing debate about whether such syntactic transformations constitute true data contamination, as it is challenging to distinguish between an LLM\u2019s ability to recall memorized information and its reasoning capability during inference. In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking.\n\nIn this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks. We first examine methods that enhance static benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap\u2014the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for dynamic benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing dynamic benchmarks.\n\nThis survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts.\n\nWe maintain a GitHub repository to continuously collect both static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs. The repository can be found at this link\u00a0111GitHub Link: Static-to-Dynamic LLM Benchmarking.\n",

    "context": "### Ethical Considerations\nOur work is rooted in the goal of enhancing the transparency and fairness of LLM evaluations, which can help mitigate the risks of bias and contamination in AI systems. However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains. Lastly, we encourage further exploration of ethical guidelines surrounding data usage, model transparency, and the broader societal impact of AI benchmarks.\n",

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

I then planned a question that requires the domain expert to reflect on the potential consequences of data contamination.\n\n### Question Generation\n\nI generated a question that is analytical, application-based, and requires the domain expert to demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the primary concern when using recent information from competitions to evaluate LLMs, and how does it impact the reliability of the evaluation results?\nA: The primary concern is the potential for data contamination, which can lead to biased evaluation results.\nB: The primary concern is the lack of diversity in test cases, which can lead to underfitting models.\nC: The primary concern is the high computational cost of generating new test cases, which can lead to overfitting models.\nD: The primary concern is the difficulty in verifying the correctness of evaluation results, which can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because data contamination is a significant issue when using recent information from competitions to evaluate LLMs. This can lead to biased evaluation results and undermine the reliability of the evaluation.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>",
