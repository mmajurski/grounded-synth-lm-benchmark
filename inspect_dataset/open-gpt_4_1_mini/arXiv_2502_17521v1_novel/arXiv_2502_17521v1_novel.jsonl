Knowledge benchmarks test retrieval of factual information and multi-domain understanding, suggesting assumptions that models have limitations in both breadth (multi-domain coverage) and depth (technical and long-context challenges). The development of refined and extended benchmarks (e.g., MMLU-Redux, MMLU-Pro) and specialized tasks (ControlBench, FRAMES) indicates a recognition that existing benchmarks are insufficient to fully capture the nuanced capabilities and weaknesses of LLMs. Implicitly, this reflects an assumption that models may excel in some areas (e.g., straightforward factual recall) but falter in others (e.g., complex reasoning, long-context management, technical accuracy).

Among these, C-SimpleQA is specifically highlighted as a benchmark designed to evaluate the factuality ability of language models to answer short questions in Chinese. This indicates a specialized focus on measuring factual accuracy in a non-English language context, emphasizing short-form question answering.\n\nThe subtlety here lies in the intersection of factual accuracy, language specificity (Chinese), and question format (short questions).

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

Static benchmarking uses fixed, human-crafted datasets but is vulnerable to contamination due to the public release of benchmarks and the massive, often opaque, data collection processes of LLMs. Dynamic benchmarking emerges as a solution to mitigate contamination risk by continuously updating or regenerating benchmarks, thus adapting to the evolving training data and increasing transparency.\n\nThe text also notes limitations of static benchmarks in transparency and adaptability, and that dynamic benchmarks, while promising, currently do not fully meet all desirable criteria for effectiveness.

Furthermore, it mentions the lack of systematic surveys on dynamic benchmarking and criteria for evaluating them, underscoring an ongoing research gap.\n\nDifficulty rating: 9/10. The question demands deep technical understanding of benchmarking methodologies, contamination implications, and the trade-offs between static and dynamic approaches. It requires synthesizing the nuanced differences in contamination risk, transparency, and adaptability, reflecting state-of-the-art challenges in LLM evaluation.\n\nThe question is designed to provoke critical reflection on how benchmarking methods cope with contamination, how transparency is maintained or compromised, and how adaptable the benchmarks are to rapid model and data evolution\u2014key concerns for domain experts evaluating or designing LLM benchmarks.\n\nThus, the question is purposeful, insightful, and encourages a sophisticated comparative analysis that goes beyond surface-level facts to consider implications and future directions.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do static and dynamic benchmarking approaches fundamentally differ in their ability to mitigate data contamination risk, maintain transparency, and adapt to the evolving training data of Large Language Models?\n\nExplanation: Static benchmarks rely on fixed datasets publicly available for evaluation, which makes them vulnerable to contamination because LLMs can inadvertently train on these datasets, inflating performance metrics; they offer transparency by being openly accessible but lack adaptability since their content does not change post-release. Dynamic benchmarks address contamination by continuously updating or regenerating datasets based on LLM training timestamps or reconstructing benchmarks, thereby reducing overlap with training data; this approach enhances adaptability by evolving alongside models and improves contamination mitigation but poses challenges in maintaining transparency and standardization due to constant changes.\n\nCorrect Answer: Static benchmarks have high transparency but high contamination risk and low adaptability, whereas dynamic benchmarks reduce contamination risk and improve adaptability but face challenges in transparency and standardization.\n</output_format>",

For example, the function \ud835\udca2\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udca2\u22c5\\mathcal{G}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_G ( \u22c5 ) could be a domain-specific an annotator.\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the expected alignment between the transformed dataset\u2019s outputs and their corresponding ground truth values, measured using the scoring function \ud835\udcae\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udcae\u22c5\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_S ( \u22c5 ).

The correctness metric is an expected value over this scoring function, indicating that the scoring function should be well-defined and capable of supporting statistical aggregation.\n\nThe complexity level is high (around 8-9), as understanding involves grasping abstract evaluation frameworks, the role of oracles, and the theoretical properties necessary for a scoring function to reliably quantify correctness in dynamic benchmarking.\n\nThe question can be framed to probe an expert\u2019s understanding of the theoretical and practical requirements for scoring functions used in correctness evaluation, inviting reflection on why specific properties are necessary and how these impact the reliability and interpretability of benchmarking results.\n\nThis question encourages deep engagement with the evaluation framework, the mathematical formalism, and the implications for benchmarking design and interpretation.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: In the context of dynamic benchmarking correctness evaluation, what key properties must a scoring function possess to reliably measure the alignment between generated outputs and ground truth, and why are these properties essential for ensuring trustworthy and interpretable benchmarking results?\n\nExplanation: The scoring function quantifies how well the generated outputs match the ground truth provided by an oracle; therefore, it must be sensitive enough to detect discrepancies, produce scores that are interpretable and comparable across different outputs, and be robust against noise or irrelevant variations to prevent misleading evaluations. These properties ensure the correctness metric accurately reflects the benchmark's fidelity to true data, enabling reliable and meaningful assessments of LLM performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: Sensitivity to discrepancies, interpretability, comparability, and robustness to noise are key properties that ensure the scoring function reliably measures alignment and supports trustworthy, interpretable benchmarking results.\n</output_format>",

To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking.\n\nIn this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks. We first examine methods that enhance static benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap\u2014the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for dynamic benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing dynamic benchmarks.\n\nThis survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts.\n\nWe maintain a GitHub repository to continuously collect both static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs. The repository can be found at this link\u00a0111GitHub Link: Static-to-Dynamic LLM Benchmarking.\n",

The context also notes that existing dynamic benchmarks have their own limitations, though it does not specify these in detail.\n\nThe nuanced theme revolves around the complexity of effectively measuring LLM performance without contamination bias, highlighting both the progress made (dynamic benchmarking) and the shortcomings that remain (lack of standardized evaluation criteria and existing benchmark limitations).

    "context": "##### 4.2.4 Stable of Complexity\nDynamic benchmarks must also account for complexity to help users determine whether a performance drop in an LLM on the transformed dataset is due to potential data contamination or an increase in task complexity. If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications. For example, DyVal\u00a0(Zhu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes applying graph complexity to evaluate the complexity of reasoning problems.\n\nFormally, given a complexity measurement function \u03a8\u2062(\u22c5)\u03a8\u22c5\\Psi(\\cdot)roman\\_\u03a8 ( \u22c5 ), the stability can be formulated as:\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the variance in complexity across different trials, where high variance indicates that the dynamic benchmarking method is not stable.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the importance of assessing the stability of complexity in dynamic benchmarking for large language models (LLMs). The central idea is that when dynamic transformations are applied to seed datasets, the complexity of resulting datasets can change, affecting model performance independently of data contamination. Therefore, understanding whether a performance drop arises from increased complexity or contamination is crucial for trustworthy evaluation. The text highlights the difficulty of measuring complexity robustly and mentions that existing metrics tend to be domain-specific and lack generalizability. It also references DyVal\u2019s approach of using graph complexity for reasoning problems. The formalization involves a complexity measurement function \u03a8(\u00b7), where stability corresponds to the variance in complexity across trials\u2014the higher the variance, the less stable the benchmarking method.\n\nImplicitly, the text points to the challenge of creating dynamic benchmarks that are both sensitive to meaningful performance changes and robust against confounding factors like complexity shifts. This requires a complexity metric that is consistent and generalizable, which remains an open problem. The context also hints at a conceptual framework where stability of complexity is quantifiable, linking it directly to variance in complexity measurements.\n\nThe difficulty is rated at 9 because this topic requires an advanced understanding of dynamic benchmarking, complexity metrics, and their mathematical treatment. It demands familiarity with concepts like data contamination, complexity measurement, and variance-based stability assessment, which are sophisticated and nuanced.\n\nThe question should encourage experts to critically evaluate the role and challenges of stability of complexity in benchmarking, reflecting on implications for trustworthiness and methodological rigor.

High variance in complexity across trials undermines trustworthiness of benchmarking results, as performance changes may reflect inconsistent difficulty rather than true model robustness. The main challenges include the domain-specific nature of existing complexity metrics, their limited generalizability, and the inherent difficulty in quantifying complexity consistently across varied tasks, which complicates establishing a reliable, universal complexity measurement function \u03a8(\u00b7).\n\nCorrect Answer: Because stable complexity measurements ensure that performance drops reflect true model issues rather than fluctuating task difficulty, but current complexity metrics are domain-specific and lack generalizability, making stable complexity assessment across diverse benchmarks challenging.\n</output_format>",

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

The text also notes that while dynamic benchmarks offer some mitigation by generating fresh data, their evaluation lacks standardized criteria, and they face challenges balancing correctness and scalability. The interplay between commercial/data privacy constraints and contamination management underscores a critical tension: protecting sensitive or proprietary data reduces contamination transparency, making contamination harder to detect and manage, which in turn compromises benchmark reliability.

Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring that benchmarks provide an accurate and reliable measure of an LLM\u2019s true ability to handle novel and unseen data.\n",

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

The text also highlights that static methods relying on high assumptions about contamination detection are insufficient, and that dynamic benchmarks, though promising, have their own shortcomings such as scalability and complexity control. The discussion of label protection implicitly points to its role in preserving evaluation reliability by preventing leakage of test labels into training data or model knowledge.

Encryption methods secure test data by making it inaccessible to unauthorized parties, utilizing techniques like public key encryption, licenses restricting derivative works, and confidential computing frameworks such as secure multi-party computation. The limitation noted is the reliance on strong key management and vulnerability if keys are compromised, as well as increased computational overhead. Label protection entails withholding true test labels from public access so only authorized evaluators can use them, preventing models from memorizing answers and thus preserving evaluation integrity.\n\nCentral ideas include the necessity of protecting evaluation data to prevent contamination of training sets, the technical approaches to achieving this protection, and the implications for maintaining fairness and integrity in model assessment. The nuanced relationship lies in balancing robust protection with practical constraints like computational cost and key security risks. The implication is that without such protections, benchmarking results could be biased or invalid due to data leakage.\n\nThe analysis leads to a question that challenges an expert to critically evaluate how these protection mechanisms impact the fairness and trustworthiness of benchmarking, considering both their strengths and limitations, and the trade-offs involved. The question should provoke reflection on the interplay between security measures and the practical realities of their deployment, and how this affects the credibility of model evaluations.\n\nDifficulty is rated 9/10 due to the requirement for advanced understanding of encryption, data contamination risks, benchmarking protocols, and evaluation integrity.\n\nThe question aims to inspire deep engagement by asking how robust protection strategies influence both the integrity and fairness of model assessment, pushing experts to synthesize technical, ethical, and practical considerations.\n\nSince the context is coherent, technical, and highly relevant to the topic, generating a question-answer pair is appropriate.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: How do encryption-based data protection and label withholding mechanisms jointly influence the integrity and fairness of machine learning model benchmarking, and what critical vulnerabilities or trade-offs must be considered to ensure these protections do not inadvertently compromise the assessment's credibility?\n\nExplanation: Encryption-based methods protect test data confidentiality by preventing unauthorized access and reuse, thus reducing data contamination risks, while label withholding prevents models from memorizing true answers, maintaining evaluation integrity. However, both approaches rely on secure key management and controlled access, presenting vulnerabilities if compromised. Additionally, encryption introduces computational overhead, and over-restriction may limit transparency and reproducibility. Balancing these factors is essential to avoid undermining fairness or trust in benchmarking results.\n\nCorrect Answer: They collectively enhance evaluation integrity and fairness by preventing data leakage and answer memorization, but their effectiveness depends on secure key management and controlled access, and they involve trade-offs like computational overhead and potential transparency loss that must be managed to maintain credible assessments.\n</output_format>",

To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to enhance static benchmarking and mitigate the impact of data contamination.\n\n\n##### 3.3.1 Canary String\nCanary strings are deliberately crafted, unique tokens embedded within a dataset to serve as markers for data contamination. When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\n###### Limitations\nThe effectiveness of canary strings depends on model trainers being aware of and responsive to these markers.\n\nIf a developer aims to leak benchmarking data to boost scores, this method will not work.\n",

Canary strings are unique tokens intentionally embedded in datasets to detect whether a model has memorized training data instead of generalizing. The core idea is that if a model outputs these unique strings, it signals memorization and contamination. The text also notes limitations: canary strings rely on the assumption that model trainers are aware of the markers and will act upon detecting them. Additionally, if developers deliberately leak benchmark data to inflate scores, canary strings become ineffective. The underlying assumptions here include: awareness and good-faith response from model developers, and that the canary tokens remain unique and detectable.\n\nThis context leads to a deep question about the foundational assumptions of canary string methods and their implications for effectiveness and applicability.

These assumptions affect reliability because if developers intentionally ignore or circumvent canary strings\u2014such as by leaking benchmark data to boost scores\u2014the method fails to detect contamination.

Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

It highlights a debate on whether such syntactic transformations truly constitute contamination, as distinguishing between memorization and reasoning is difficult. The text points out that in some NLP applications, syntactic information alone drives decision-making, making contamination via syntactic similarity problematic. The significance lies in how contamination, especially syntactic, can inflate evaluation scores, misleading assessments of generalization and robustness of LLMs. This affects benchmark validity, model comparison, deployment, and policy-making. The core relationship is that syntactic contamination challenges the integrity of benchmarks for models evaluated on tasks relying heavily on syntactic cues, thus compromising the evaluation of true reasoning versus memorized recall.\n\nImplicitly, this suggests that contamination is not merely about exact data duplication but also subtle transformations that preserve syntactic structure, which can still bias evaluation results.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

The text emphasizes that although various dynamic benchmarking strategies have been proposed\u2014such as continuously updating benchmark datasets based on training timestamps or regenerating benchmark data\u2014no systematic survey or evaluation criteria for these dynamic benchmarks have previously been established.\n\nImportantly, the authors claim to be the first to propose a set of criteria to evaluate dynamic benchmarks and note that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully meet these criteria, indicating a gap in current benchmarking designs. However, the actual criteria themselves are not detailed in the given context.

It first extracts reasoning graphs from existing benchmarks and then perturbs them into new samples using predefined rules.\n\nC2LEVA\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2024c) incorporates all three contamination-free construction methods to build a contamination-free bilingual evaluation.\n\n\n### 5 Discussions\nKey Insights.\n\nOur analysis highlights two key insights regarding data contamination in LLM benchmarking. First, static benchmarks become less effective as training corpora grow. The probability of contamination increases with Prcontam\u221d|\ud835\udc9ftrain|\u22c5|\ud835\udc9ftest|\u22121proportional-tosubscriptPrcontam\u22c5subscript\ud835\udc9ftrainsuperscriptsubscript\ud835\udc9ftest1\\text{Pr}\\_{\\text{contam}}\\propto|\\mathcal{D}\\_{\\text{train}}|\\cdot|\\mathcal{D}\\_%\n\n{\\text{test}}|^{-1}Pr start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT contam end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT \u221d | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT train end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | \u22c5 | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT test end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, rendering traditional benchmarks outdated for models trained on web-scale data. Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context discusses the limitations and challenges surrounding LLM benchmarking, particularly focusing on data contamination issues in static benchmarks and the move towards dynamic benchmarks. It highlights that static benchmarks become less effective as training data size grows because contamination probability increases proportionally, making traditional benchmarks outdated. It also points out that static methods rely heavily on assumptions such as post-hoc contamination detection, which lacks transparency and depends on indirect inference rather than direct evidence. This raises questions about the validity and reliability of contamination detection in static benchmarks. The text also emphasizes that dynamic benchmarks attempt to address these limitations but bring new challenges such as balancing correctness and scalability and controlling complexity.\n\nFrom this, the key focus for the question is the assumptions and limitations of post-hoc contamination detection methods in static benchmarking.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n",

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context introduces \"collision\" as a critical concept in dynamic benchmarking, especially relevant when benchmarking datasets are publicly available and potentially used to train large language models (LLMs). The core idea is that if transformations of a benchmark dataset overlap substantially, the benchmark loses its ability to create novel and diverse test cases, which undermines its reliability in genuinely assessing LLM capabilities. Collision is quantified via two metrics: Collision Rate, which measures overlap between independently transformed datasets, and Repeat Trials, which estimates how many attempts are needed to recreate an existing transformed dataset. These metrics directly address the risk of data contamination\u2014when a benchmark becomes part of training data\u2014by assessing if a dynamic benchmark can still offer fresh evaluation challenges.
