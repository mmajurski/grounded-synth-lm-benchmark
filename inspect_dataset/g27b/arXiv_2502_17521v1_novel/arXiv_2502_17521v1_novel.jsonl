Similarly, TRUCE (Chandran et\u00a0al., 2024) leverages confidential computing and secure multi-party computation to enable private benchmarking, ensuring that test data and model parameters remain confidential.\n\n\n###### Limitation\nWhile these methods effectively protect against data leakage, they depend on strong key management, they introduce extra computational overheads. These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment. This approach is common in benchmarks such as GLUE Wang (2018), SuperGLUE Wang et\u00a0al. (2019), and OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Chen et\u00a0al. (2021), etc., where the test labels are withheld to prevent models from learning or memorizing them during training. The key advantage of this method is its ability to maintain evaluation integrity by preventing model exposure to answers, thereby mitigating data contamination risks.\n",

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment.

We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications. For example, DyVal\u00a0(Zhu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes applying graph complexity to evaluate the complexity of reasoning problems.\n\nFormally, given a complexity measurement function \u03a8\u2062(\u22c5)\u03a8\u22c5\\Psi(\\cdot)roman\\_\u03a8 ( \u22c5 ), the stability can be formulated as:\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the variance in complexity across different trials, where high variance indicates that the dynamic benchmarking method is not stable.\n",

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials. Repeat Trials quantifies the expected number of transformation trials required to fully regenerate an existing transformed dataset Ti\u2062(\ud835\udc9f)subscript\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc9fT\\_{i}(\\mathcal{D})italic\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( caligraphic\\_D ), providing insight into the benchmark\u2019s ability to produce novel variations.\n\nThese metrics help assess whether a dynamic benchmark remains effective in evaluating LLM capabilities, even when exposed to potential training data contamination.\n",

It defines two metrics to quantify this risk: Collision Rate and Repeat Trials. The core idea is that a robust benchmark should generate diverse and novel test cases, minimizing overlap between transformations.\n2. **Concept Exploration:** The text implies that a high Collision Rate and a low Repeat Trials value would indicate a weak benchmark susceptible to contamination. Conversely, a low Collision Rate and a high Repeat Trials value suggest a robust benchmark capable of generating genuinely novel test cases. The underlying theory relates to the need for benchmarks to accurately reflect real-world LLM performance, not just performance on data they've already seen.\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration:** Difficulty: 8/10.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks.

Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials.

Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials. Repeat Trials quantifies the expected number of transformation trials required to fully regenerate an existing transformed dataset Ti\u2062(\ud835\udc9f)subscript\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc9fT\\_{i}(\\mathcal{D})italic\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( caligraphic\\_D ), providing insight into the benchmark\u2019s ability to produce novel variations.\n\nThese metrics help assess whether a dynamic benchmark remains effective in evaluating LLM capabilities, even when exposed to potential training data contamination.\n",

    "context": "### 1 Introduction\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has advanced rapidly in recent years, fueled by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude3, and DeepSeek\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications.

In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string.

In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making.

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.
