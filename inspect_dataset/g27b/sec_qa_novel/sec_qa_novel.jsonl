It is easy to understand,\n\ncompute, and trivial to crack. Let's create a table that maps every letter in the alphabet to a different letter:\n\n:::: table\n\n::: content\n\n| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   | I   | J   | K   | L   | M   | N   | O   | P   | Q   | R   | S   | T   | U   | V   | W   | X   | Y   | Z   |\n\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n\n| J   | G   | T   | Q   | X   | Y   | A   | U   | C   | R   | V   | I   | F   | H   | O   | K   | L   | E   | D   | B   | W   | S   | Z   | M   | N   | P   |\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nNow creating a message is simple a matter of performing the substitutions. For example, `HELLO WORLD`{.literal} becomes\n\n`UXIIO ZOEIQ`{.literal}.\n\nWhile this is simple to understand and set up, it is also very easy to break. You could use a frequency attack, where\n\nyou analyze a large chunk of encrypted text knowing that certain letters are more frequent than others. By matching up\n\nthe most frequently used ciphertext letters with their standard English equivalents you may quickly reach a solution.\n\nYou could also go through all permutations of the alphabet (4E26) and see what gives you the most English words.

Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.

[SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission.

It stands for *Authentication*,\n\n*Authorization*, and *Accounting* and it is used in designing and implementing protocols. These concepts should be\n\nremembered when designing security plans.\n\nAuthentication is the process of confirming someone's identity. This may be done with user names and passwords or more\n\nfrequently via multi-factor authentication (MFA) which requires not only something you know, but something you have\n\n(fingerprints, key fob, etc.).\n\nAuthorization refers to keeping track of which resources an entity has access to. This can be done via a permission\n\nscheme or access control list (ACL). Occasionally you will encounter something more exotic where authorization limits\n\nusers to interactions during a particular time of day or from a particular IP address.\n\nAccounting refers to tracking the usage of resources. This may be as simple as noting in a log file when a user has\n\nlogged in to keeping track of exactly which services and user uses and how long they use them. Accounting is incredibly\n\nimportant because it allows you to not only monitor for possible problems, but also inspect what has occurred *after* a\n\nproblem is encountered. Accounting also allows system administrators to show irrefutably what actions a user has taken.\n\nThis can be very important evidence in a court of law.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.3.

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends. These groups can be very sophisticated.\n\nThe most well known hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several politically motivated attacks.\n\nOrganized crime is another element which may employ or support threat actors typically to make money. These groups\n\ntypically have access to more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note that threat actors with\n\nroots in organized crime may find it easier to migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large\n\ncriminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a\n\nhacker working with an organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are familiar with the sale of stolen\n\ngoods.\n\nThe last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most resources, are threat actors working with or for\n\ngovernments and nation states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of their country to commit\n\ncyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are\n\nreferred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT).

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed.

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed.

Zone Transfer Attacks {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__zone_transfer_attacks}\nOn the subject of the domain name system, zone transfer attacks may leak sensitive information about domains. DNS is a\n\ndistributed system by design and is used for resolving domain names into IP addresses. Due to the distributed nature of\n\nthe system, protocols were built in for having a single domain served by multiple servers. These servers pass\n\ninformation to each other using a DNS zone transfer.\n\nTypically these communications should be internal as they may leak valuable information regarding the zone.\n\nUnfortunately an improperly configured DNS server may advertise its zone transfers publicly. [In such a situation an\n\nattacker can use the leaked information in the recon phase of an\n\nattack.](https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php){.link}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.5.12.

Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data.

Digital Certificates {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__digital_certificates}\nA digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company or an individual. Since asymmetric encryption\n\nrequires know a party's public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of the owner. The question\n\nthen becomes how do you trust that the public key is *actually* for the alleged owner? That's where the issuing\n\nauthority comes in. A *certificate authority (CA)* signs the certificate indicating that the ID and public_key are\n\ncorrect. Certificates can be self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often only used in\n\ntesting. Since most certificates are used for encrypting web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is\n\nusing a self-signed certificate.\n\nGiven how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not\n\nissues by root CAs, but are actually issued by intermediate CAs. Root CAs delegate the work to Intermediate CAs and\n\nindicate their trust in them by signing the intermediate CAs keys. This creates a *chain of trust* from the issued\n\ncertificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA (signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by\n\nthe browser). Tools that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and update them from the companies\n\nthat issue them as needed.\n\nThe certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact with it is often possible to install root CAs\n\nmanually. [This is can be used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for\n\ndebugging](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert){.link} or for more nefarious\n\npurposes. For this reason some applications, Facebook mobiles apps for example, maintain their own certificate store and\n\nprevent users from adding root CAs to it.\n\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/letsencrypt.svg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"letsencrypt\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nSo how do you get a certificate for your website? The customer will generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that\n\nincludes the public key and their ID. The CA will validate that the customer owns the website and build and sign the\n\ncert. This whole process can be automated and performed for free via a tool called [Let's\n\nEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){.link}.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"2.10.6. Blockchain\"}\n",

Learning the Lingo {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__learning_the_lingo}\nIn general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary. Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2. AAA\"}\n",

Why do we need cryptography? {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__why_do_we_need_cryptography}\nCryptography is used to set up secure channels of communication, but it can also be used to provide non-repudiation of\n\nactions, basically leaving digital footprints that show someone did something. This means that cryptography allows us to\n\nprovide authentication, authorization, *and* accounting (AAA).\n\nBy using a secure and *confidential* encrypted channel we can be sure that anyone who intercepts our communications\n\ncannot \\\"listen in.\\\" This helps prevents *man-in-the-middle (MITM)* attacks. Cryptography can also be used to provide\n\n*integrity*: proving that the data is valid. With cryptography you can provide a *signature* for the data showing that\n\nthe person who claims to have sent it really did send it. Cryptography also allows for *non-repudiation* as it can show\n\nthat only one person was capable of sending a particular message. Lastly cryptography also allows us to perform\n\nauthentication *without* storing passwords in plaintext. This is critical in an age where data breaches are increasingly\n\ncommon.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Case Study: Equifax\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n",

Business Continuity has three main parts: Business Continuity Planning\n\n(BCP), Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP).\n\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) is a methodology for keeping things running. With BCP threats are identified in\n\nadvance and critical business processes are prioritized. Recovery procedures for these processes have been developed and\n\ntested. In response to an incident, these procedures are followed as practiced.\n\nBusiness Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies business functions and rates the impact of an outage on these functions. BIA\n\nmeasures the impact of an outage on:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Property (tangible assets)]{.principal}\n\n- [Finance (monetary funding)]{.principal}\n\n- [Safety (physical protection)]{.principal}\n\n- [Reputation (status)]{.principal}\n\n- [Life (well being)]{.principal}\n\n- [Customers]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nBIA can help pinpoint mission-essential functions and single points of failure.

In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for\n\nconnections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on.\n\nYou may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them.

While individual controls may provide multiple parts, it is still important to\n\nunderstand what each part represents:\n\n::: description-list\n\n[Identification]{.term}\n\n:   [The act of identifying an actor or *something* that is used to identify an actor. This could be as simple as a\n\n    drivers license or as complex as a cryptographic signature that can only be made by the bearer of a private key.\n\n    Example: A delivery driver presenting an employee badge.]{.principal}\n\n[Authentication]{.term}\n\n:   [This step occurs when an identity is confirmed through the use of a specific process. This could be the process\n\n    through which the private key is used or perhaps another biometric process such as reading a fingerprint. In either\n\n    case the *authentication* is the method by which we verify identity. Example: Examining the delivery driver's\n\n    badge.]{.principal}\n\n[Authorization]{.term}\n\n:   [Authorization is when an actor is given permission to access a resource. In casual conversation we may assume that\n\n    *authorization* is a foregone conclusion once an actor has progressed this far, but in actuality authorization\n\n    relies on the previous steps being completed and may in fact fail. A system may have identified who someone was\n\n    through authentication with a username and password, but that user is not set up to have access to a resource. In\n\n    this case the *authorization* step would fail. To continue with our delivery driver example: Allowing the delivery\n\n    driver to pick up a package.]{.principal}\n\n[Accounting]{.term}\n\n:   [Finally accounting is the process through which a record of access to the resource is recorded. Accounting may be a\n\n    log of users who have signed in an log of what resources they each accessed.

Lastly victim has been poorly configured to ignore changes to the host key. This is\n\nnot entirely unreasonable as many users just ignore the warnings and clear out the known_hosts file when prompted\n\nanyway.\n\nStart by downloading the [scapy.zip](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/scapy.zip){.link} file which\n\ncontains the Docker Compose configuration we will be using. Uncompress it to a directory where you have write access.\n\nThis lab will require us to use three terminal windows/tabs: one for the `docker-compose up`{.literal} command which\n\nwill show the output of everything running in the background, one for the victim which will show an SSH session with the\n\nserver, and one for the attacker which we will use to make the attack.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/scapy.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"scapy\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nOpen three terminals and `cd`{.literal} into the directory where you uncompressed the lab zip file in each of them.\n\nThere should be a `docker-compose.yml`{.literal} file and `server`{.literal}, `victim`{.literal}, and\n\n`attacker`{.literal} directories in the directory you are in.\n\nIn the first terminal run the `docker-compose up`{.literal} command to build the images and run the containers:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>PS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\scapy&gt; docker-compose up\n\nCreating network &quot;scapy_testnet&quot; with the default driver\n\nCreating scapy_server_1   ... done\n\nCreating scapy_victim_1   ... done\n\nCreating scapy_attacker_1 ... done\n\nAttaching to scapy_victim_1, scapy_server_1, scapy_attacker_1\n\nserver_1    | &gt; Starting SSHD\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Generating new host keys\n\nscapy_victim_1 exited with code 0\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 No host keys configured, using keys at &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame&quot;\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_rsa_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_ecdsa_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_ed25519_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Listening on [::]:22 \u2460\n\nserver_1    | ssh-keygen: generating new host keys: RSA DSA ECDSA ED25519\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for dsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 1024 MD5:a5:e6:e9:38:d2:2e:88:fd:f0:aa:a8:05:07:35:5f:18 root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | 1024 SHA256:NM7DONpt1doZp4e6WV+6WVVr+KUrh9luUSRcAhnzdyw root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | 1024 SHA512:LHfFdSk1XiAKQArH0CW+RkaKv5GgovPCH7UIQ+P4T2LbgGpCBP5aGA1V3oriYbTZWuS9TlUgDbEfTBq19AV/cA root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for rsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 3072 MD5:74:44:b6:a2:74:b9:7e:1b:ba:3d:27:b8:19:3a:48:df root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | 3072 SHA256:mubm9mLNrdNDk5fyj0dghDBIbbwcVKXo23Qdv61/S/c root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | 3072 SHA512:JFQhS6trY7sNqRSwZ+t0uyBb5ddNh9qSLtBrMaa5G7xWzKHpxCuKBSDbvLk4W9JKeQftTU4293UDV9vqCcf/6w root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for ecdsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 256 MD5:15:75:5f:9b:72:7c:f0:13:ea:0d:b4:47:b7:62:69:63 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA256:4p/Afp/8C2tHn7AePdS7OHCgPxfBamdaLIUg4IJ7xx4 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA512:NnbevqBXFkGQWIirdFsLPnX85q7q/1Y7E4i+BLHLqE3cg2aqkduBJsssyr9+G7bSvq7txvjl9SRmyRAzuDT7DQ root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for ed25519 host key\n\nserver_1    | 256 MD5:ad:00:61:26:4d:a0:07:be:6b:8e:91:bd:f0:65:e6:14 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA256:Vl7jQulDsONglP1xbSN+J8nSfCaIER40rHhgy7z/BYg root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA512:WkmvOWe6oaZ/qE1ZiA0rZAjn9H+hCDxI8NHpsjRNCalK/CgVV9+VhkzHgRTKfKTqQeE0y/Zz2GaEJGv/sapCHg root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: No SSH authorized_keys found!\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Unlocking root account\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: password authentication enabled.\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: password authentication for root user enabled.\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Running: /etc/entrypoint.d/changepw.sh\n\nserver_1    | Running /usr/sbin/sshd -D -e -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nserver_1    | Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22. \u2461\n\nserver_1    | Server listening on :: port 22.</code></pre>\n\n<figcaption>Listing 1. docker-compose up</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* Notice that attacker has a fake SSH server running in the background\n\n2.  *\u2461* Notice that server has a legitimate SSH server running in the background\n\n:::\n\n<aside class=\"admonition note\" title=\"Note\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nIf you receive the error\n\n`failed to create network scapy_testnet: Error response from daemon: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space`{.literal}\n\ncheck to see if you have other containers running and stop them.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThis document details a lab exercise demonstrating a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack using Scapy and a fake SSH server (sshesame). The attacker manipulates ARP tables to intercept traffic between a victim and a server, ultimately capturing the victim's SSH credentials. The lab setup involves Docker containers for the attacker, victim, and server, with pre-configured IP addresses. The core of the attack relies on sending a malicious ARP packet to the victim, redirecting their traffic through the attacker's system, where sshesame intercepts the SSH login attempt. The document includes detailed terminal outputs and instructions for setting up and executing the attack. The complexity is high, requiring understanding of networking concepts (ARP, IP, MAC addresses), SSH, and Scapy packet manipulation. The primary takeaway is the vulnerability of systems relying on trust without proper verification (like ignoring SSH host key changes) and the power of network-level attacks.

SSH Keys\"}\n\n\n### 7.3.7. SSH Keys {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ssh_keys}\nSecure Shell Server (SSH) supports the use of asymmetric encryption keys for authentication. Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data. This bit of data is useless to the MitM.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.8. Sessions and Cookies\"}\n",

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

Through the shell you can create, read, update, or delete files, make network\n\nconnections, configure kernel parameters, install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells that\n\ncan be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an\n\nattacker would need to have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is being able to interact\n\nwith a shell remotely on the exploited machine.\n\nIn this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote shells can run in the background on a victim\n\nmachine listening on a port for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not actually have an\n\nexternal IP the attacker can use to connect. In these instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out\n\nfrom the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the inside*. This is more compatible with the\n\nfirewalls/NAT routers that sit between most devices and the Internet.\n\nIn either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote connection allows an attacker to basically do\n\nanything they want. To that end, many tools have sprung up to provide remote shell access. A machine may already have a\n\nremote shell tool installed, such as an SSH server. Barring that [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/){.link} can be\n\nused with any executable to provide access to it over a network. [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/){.link} (a\n\nvery popular pentesting framework) comes with many payloads, most of which are shells of various types. Programs also\n\nexist to run shells over ICMP, Discord, IRC, or even DNS!\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n:::::::::\n\n::::::::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"5.7. Lab: MitM with Scapy\"}\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination:** The context describes remote shells and their implications, focusing on the power they grant to an attacker. It details how attackers gain shell access (direct connection, reverse shell), tools used to achieve this (SSH, Netcat, Metasploit), and the broad capabilities afforded by such access. The core idea is that privileged shell access equates to complete control.\n2. **Concept Exploration:** The text highlights the versatility of shell access \u2013 it's not limited to Linux, exists in Windows (PowerShell), and can be established through various protocols (ICMP, Discord, DNS). This emphasizes the adaptability of attackers. The concept of a reverse shell is crucial for bypassing network restrictions.\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration:** Difficulty: 9/10.

The document provides detailed terminal outputs and instructions for replicating the attack. The key takeaway is how ARP spoofing can redirect traffic and enable credential theft, and the importance of host key verification and passwordless authentication.

The distinction was eventually lost and a hacker has come to be\n\nthe popular term for someone attempting to gain unauthorized access to data. For an interesting glimpse into early\n\nhacker culture/reasoning read [The Conscience of a\n\nHacker](https://archive.org/stream/The_Conscience_of_a_Hacker/hackersmanifesto.txt){.link} by The Mentor originally\n\npublished in Phrack Magazine 1986.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Hacker Hats\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Hacker Hats\n:::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/hats.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"hats\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nAn early attempt at classifying hackers involved assigning hat colors according to their motivations. This harkens back\n\nto the old western movies where the bad guys wore black hats and the good guys wore white hats.

It is also worth nothing that the second quadrant of our graph is empty, but\n\nthis does not mean that there aren't malicious, legal hackers.

For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

Modern ransomware uses\n\nsymmetric encryption to the files quickly and then encrypts the symmetric key asymmetrically using a hard-coded public\n\nkey for which the threat actor has the corresponding private key. When the ransom is paid, typically via cryptocurrency,\n\nthe threat actor can decrypt the symmetric key using their private key and the user can use the symmetric key to decrypt\n\nthe files.\n\nRansomware is considered a data breach in the data is often exfiltrated as well. It is also worth noting that when the\n\nransom is paid, there is no guarantee that the threat actor will actually begin the decryption process. Typical targets\n\nof ransomware include corporate infrastructure and health care systems although ransomware may also be spread\n\nindeterminately. The payout of ransoms can be a large money-making enterprise so many APTs or criminal groups may employ\n\nits use.
