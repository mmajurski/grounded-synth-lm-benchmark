The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1\u20135 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4\u20138 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1\u20136).  Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all.  Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the \"curse\" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables.

The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1\u20135 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4\u20138 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1\u20136).  Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all.  Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the \"curse\" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables.

The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1\u20135 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4\u20138 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1\u20136).

The only true scored \"instrument\" is an electric metronome for each individual player, though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer.  Because the graphic notation of score (which is a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths) leaves a lot of room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced.  There is no conductor for the performance.  It has been recorded on the album \"Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's & 1990's\".  In a review of a performance by the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1992 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the music critic of \"The New York Times\", Alex Ross, described the piece as \"merely a timid, spastic prelude to Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's monumental \"Po\u00e8me symphonique\" for 100 metronomes\".

    "response": "```xml\n<document_analysis>\nThoughtful Content Examination: The text describes \"Music for Electric Metronomes\" as an avant-garde, aleatoric composition for 3-8 performers, centered around electric metronomes and performer-determined sounds/actions. It emphasizes the theatrical nature of the piece, its Fluxus affiliation, the open interpretation allowed by its graphic notation, and the absence of a conductor. The text also briefly introduces the composer, Toshi Ichiyanagi.\n\nConcept Exploration: The core concept is the radical departure from traditional ensemble performance practices. Traditional ensembles rely on a conductor, a fixed score, and precise replication. This piece inverts those norms, placing significant agency in the hands of the performers. The role of the performer shifts from interpreter to co-creator. The reference to Ligeti\u2019s work provides a point of comparison regarding mechanical sound sources.\n\nStrategic Complexity Calibration: Difficulty: 9/10. This question requires understanding of avant-garde music principles, aleatoric composition, the Fluxus movement, and the implications of removing traditional roles (like the conductor) from a musical performance. It goes beyond simply recalling facts; it demands a comparative analysis of performance paradigms.\n\nIntentional Question Planning: The question aims to probe the expert's understanding of how the performer's role is fundamentally altered in this piece compared to traditional ensemble settings. It forces a nuanced comparison, considering agency, interpretation, and the nature of the musical score.
