Lab: Malicious Containers {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_malicious_containers}\nWhile containers have made it much easier to deploy software, they have also made it easier to deploy *malicious*\n\nsoftware. Imagine that we have an internal company website, written in PHP and deployed in a Docker container. Given the\n\nlayered nature of the Docker build system, this application is *trusting* that the images it is building from are\n\nsecure. Take a look at the following `Dockerfile`{.literal} to see just how easy it is to slip something malicious into\n\nthe image:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>FROM php:apache\n\nCOPY shell.php /var/www/html/shell.php\n\nCOPY index.php /var/www/html/index.php</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n`shell.php`{.literal} is a shell written in PHP that will execute with the permissions of the web server. This means it\n\nwill be able to read and write (but not overwrite) in the /var/www/html directory.\n\nLet's download, build, and run this image. Download [the malicious.zip\n\nfile](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/malicious.zip){.link}, unzip it in a directory where you have write\n\naccess, and navigate to that directory in your shell.\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>PS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\malicious&gt; docker build -t malicious . \u2460\n\n[+] Building 32.4s (8/8) FINISHED\n\n =&gt; [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                                                                                                                                        0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring dockerfile: 134B                                                                                                                                                                        0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load .dockerignore                                                                                                                                                                           0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring context: 2B                                                                                                                                                                             0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/php:apache                                                                                                                                              32.2s\n\n =&gt; [1/3] FROM docker.io/library/php:apache@sha256:f1c5dba2a2981f91ec31b9596d4165acd0b46e58382e47622487e130a21e420d                                                                                         0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load build context                                                                                                                                                                           0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring context: 61B                                                                                                                                                                            0.0s\n\n =&gt; CACHED [2/3] COPY shell.php /var/www/html/shell.php                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; CACHED [3/3] COPY index.php /var/www/html/index.php                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; exporting to image                                                                                                                                                                                      0.1s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; exporting layers                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; writing image sha256:e1dc75a91b2e269091069b1e3406a496b4bbfd95b066f970062ea8b3a74d8368                                                                                                                0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; naming to docker.io/library/malicious                                                                                                                                                                0.0s\n\nPS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\malicious&gt; docker run -p 8080:80 malicious \u2461\n\nAH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server&#39;s fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.2.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the security vulnerabilities in Docker containers, specifically focusing on the potential for malicious software to be deployed within containers. It highlights the importance of trusting the images used in the Docker build system and demonstrates how easily malicious code can be inserted into an image. The context provides a lab scenario where a Dockerfile is used to build an image with a malicious PHP shell, which can execute with web server permissions. The lab involves downloading, building, and running the malicious image, and then using the shell to create a new web page on the compromised server.\n\nUpon analyzing the context, it becomes clear that the primary concern is the security of Docker containers and the potential for malicious activity. The context emphasizes the need for trusted images and secure configuration practices to mitigate these risks. The lab scenario serves as a practical example of how vulnerabilities can be exploited and the importance of careful consideration when building and deploying Docker images.\n\nThe thought process behind generating a question from this context involves identifying the key concepts and themes related to Docker container security. This includes understanding the potential vulnerabilities, the importance of trusted images, and the need for secure configuration practices. The question should be designed to challenge the domain expert's knowledge and encourage a deep understanding of the subject matter.\n\nGiven the context and the objective of generating a highly insightful and probing question, the difficulty level of the question is rated as 8 out of 10. The question should require the domain expert to demonstrate a thorough understanding of Docker container security, including the potential risks and mitigation strategies.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What command would be used to create a new file named `timeoff.html` with the text `GRANTED` in the `/var/www/html` directory of a Docker container running an Apache web server, assuming the user has the necessary permissions?\nA: echo \"GRANTED\" > /var/www/html/timeoff.html\nB: touch /var/www/html/timeoff.html && echo \"GRANTED\" >> /var/www/html/timeoff.html\nC: mkdir /var/www/html/timeoff.html && echo \"GRANTED\" > /var/www/html/timeoff.html\nD: rm /var/www/html/timeoff.html && echo \"GRANTED\" > /var/www/html/timeoff.html\nExplanation: The correct answer, A, uses the echo command to create a new file with the specified text.

Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.  [User accesses a sevice]{.principal}\n\n2.  [User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request]{.principal}\n\n3.  [User logs in]{.principal}\n\n4.  [Credentials are verified]{.principal}\n\n5.  [SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one. The following diagram\n\nhighlights the differences between OpenID authentication and an OAuth flow:\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/oauth.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"oauth\" />\n\n</div>\n\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">OpenID vs. Pseudo-Authentication using OAuth</a> by <a\n\nhref=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\" class=\"link\">Perhelion</a>\n\nused under <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenIDvs.Pseudo-AuthenticationusingOAuth.svg\"\n\nclass=\"link\">CC0 1.0</a></figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.10.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

The key points mentioned are CTR mode's ability to function in parallel due to the use of a nonce and counter, and its capability to solve the problems associated with ECB mode. Additionally, the context touches upon Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and its differences from CTR, such as the use of an IV instead of a nonce and the generation of a message authentication code (MAC) for each block.\n\nGiven this information, the question should aim to test the expert's understanding of how CTR mode achieves parallelization and its implications for security and efficiency.

Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

Lab: Linux File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_linux_file_permissions}\nIn this lab we are going to explore UNIX style file permissions and determine what they can do and why they are limited.\n\nFinally we will see how Linux ACLs provide more flexibility in assigning permissions.\n\nWe will be working in a vanilla Ubuntu container and installing software and adding users manually. Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

It is broken into\n\ntwo groups: clients using UDP port 161 (TLS 10161) and a manager using UDP port 162 (TLS 10162). The manager collects\n\nmessages from the clients regarding the operations of the network and uses this information to take actions as\n\nnecessary. SNMP can be used to pass information about the temperature of a machine, how many connections it currently\n\nhas, the channel capacity currently being utilized, etc. SNMP is currently up to version 3 which is encrypted and\n\nrequires authentication. This is particularly important because SNMP is a very powerful protocol which exchanges\n\ninformation that could potentially be very valuable to an attacker.

Clients use UDP port 161 (and TLS 10161 for secure communication), while managers use UDP port 162 (and TLS 10162 for secure communication). The manager's role is to collect messages from clients about network operations and take necessary actions.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: Implicit in this explanation is the importance of SNMP in network management, including its ability to provide detailed information about network devices, such as temperature, connections, and channel capacity utilization. The current version of SNMP (version 3) is encrypted and requires authentication, highlighting the protocol's potential vulnerability if not properly secured.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: Given the technical nature of the topic, a question that probes the understanding of SNMP's components and their interactions would be appropriately challenging. A difficulty rating of 8 out of 10 is assigned due to the need for the question to delve into specific details of SNMP operation and security considerations.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: The question should invite a deeper understanding of the roles of SNMP clients and managers and their communication methods.

Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

Currently\n\nthere are two main versions of the IP protocol, IPv4 and IPv6, and one of the major differences is in how many IP\n\naddresses are available. IPv4 supports 32 bit addresses and IPv6 supports 128 bit addresses. To give an idea of how big\n\nof a change that is, we have currently allocated all possible IPv4 addresses, but with IPv6 we could give an address to\n\nevery grain of sand on the beaches of earth and still not run out.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"IPv6 Security Implications\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n",

Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

Because ICMP messages work at the\n\nnetwork layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue with the internet layer.\n\nThe most common use for ICMP is the `ping`{.literal} command. `ping`{.literal} sends an ICMP echo request to check to\n\nsee if a host is up. By responding to the request with the data included in the request we can assume that the host is\n\nup and functioning.\n\nICMP is also used in the `traceroute`{.literal} command. `traceroute`{.literal} incrementally increase the Time To Live\n\n(TTL) field of ICMP packets and watches for *TTL Exceeded* messages to determine what route packets are taking to get to\n\na host.

Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.  [User accesses a sevice]{.principal}\n\n2.  [User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request]{.principal}\n\n3.  [User logs in]{.principal}\n\n4.  [Credentials are verified]{.principal}\n\n5.  [SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one.

Lab: Linux File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_linux_file_permissions}\nIn this lab we are going to explore UNIX style file permissions and determine what they can do and why they are limited.\n\nFinally we will see how Linux ACLs provide more flexibility in assigning permissions.\n\nWe will be working in a vanilla Ubuntu container and installing software and adding users manually. Let's start up the\n\ncontainer, install the packages we need, and add some users to work with:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\docs&gt;docker run -it ubuntu bash\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get update\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/# apt-get install acl\n\nReading package lists...

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself. Set the\n\npermissions such that only you can view the contents. Show the permissions of the home directory and demonstrate that\n\nanother user *cannot* view its contents. Take a screenshot showing all of this and submit this as one of your\n\ndeliverables.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nUnfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the granularity needed in a modern system. For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo design an access control scheme for a Linux system that incorporates both traditional file permissions and ACLs, we must first understand the limitations and capabilities of each. Traditional UNIX file permissions provide a basic level of access control by assigning read, write, and execute permissions to the user, group, and others. However, these permissions often lack the granularity needed for complex access control requirements.\n\nThe provided context explores the use of traditional UNIX file permissions and their limitations, particularly in scenarios where more fine-grained access control is necessary, such as allowing a web server to access specific user directories without exposing them to all users. It introduces Linux ACLs (Access Control Lists) as a solution to overcome these limitations, enabling more precise control over file and directory permissions.\n\nThe analysis involves understanding the `chmod` command for modifying traditional permissions and the `setfacl` and `getfacl` commands for managing ACLs. A key aspect is recognizing how ACLs can be used to grant specific permissions to users or groups beyond the traditional owner, group, and other categories, thus providing a more flexible and secure access control mechanism.\n\nGiven the context, a challenging question would involve applying this understanding to a scenario that requires balancing access needs with security constraints, potentially involving the use of both traditional permissions and ACLs to achieve the desired level of access control.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What command would you use to add read and execute permissions for a specific user to an existing directory, while keeping the traditional permissions intact, and how would you verify that these permissions have been correctly applied?\nA: chmod u+r,x <directory>\nB: setfacl -m u:<user>:r-x <directory>\nC: chown <user> <directory>\nD: getfacl -m u:<user>:r-x <directory>\n\nExplanation: The correct answer involves using the `setfacl` command to modify the ACL of the directory, specifically adding read and execute permissions for a specified user. This approach allows for fine-grained control over permissions beyond what traditional UNIX permissions offer. The `getfacl` command is used to verify the permissions, making option B the correct choice for applying the permissions and option D incorrect as it suggests using `getfacl` for setting permissions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

I planned the question to invite deeper understanding and critical engagement with the content, focusing on the authentication schemes supported by SSH.\n\nI ignored irrelevant elements, such as the discussion of LDAP, as it is not directly related to the question topic of SSH and its authentication schemes. I also excluded any information that appeared nonsensical or disconnected from the primary subject matter.\n\nBased on my analysis, I generated a question that requires a deep understanding of SSH and its authentication schemes, as well as the ability to synthesize high-level general understanding.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What authentication scheme supported by SSH utilizes a pair of keys, one public and one private, to authenticate a user without requiring a password?\nA: Password authentication\nB: Key authentication\nC: Hardware device authentication\nD: SOCKS5 proxy authentication\nExplanation: SSH supports many authentication schemes, including key authentication, which uses a pair of keys to authenticate a user.

The central idea of the context is the distinction between passive and active reconnaissance methods in computer systems security. Passive recon involves gathering information without sending anything to the target, such as accessing publicly available information or passively sniffing network packets. Active recon, on the other hand, involves interaction with the target, including port scanning, vulnerability scanning, or contacting workers.\n\nThe context highlights the key differences between passive and active recon, including the level of detectability and the amount of information that can be gathered.

FTP uses TCP on\n\nport 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The\n\ninteresting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server\n\nto client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would\n\nfail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.\n\nDespite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate\n\nenvironments.

Learning the Lingo {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__learning_the_lingo}\nIn general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary.

These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2. AAA\"}\n",

False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the basics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), including its request and response structure, methods, paths, and standard response codes. It also touches upon the use of headers in HTTP requests and responses. A crucial point mentioned is that unencrypted HTTP traffic, which is sent over port 80, is vulnerable to attacks because all information is sent in cleartext. This implies significant security risks, including eavesdropping and tampering. \n\nGiven the topic of security vulnerabilities associated with unencrypted HTTP traffic, the key concept to explore is the risk of sending information in cleartext. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to intercept sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identifiable information, which can then be used for malicious purposes.\n\nThe analysis of the context reveals that the security vulnerability of unencrypted HTTP traffic is a critical issue. The fact that all information is sent in cleartext makes it easily accessible to attackers, who can intercept and exploit this data. This highlights the need for encryption, such as HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), to protect data in transit.\n\nTo generate a question that inspires thoughtful engagement and requires a deep understanding of the content, we need to consider the implications of sending information in cleartext over unencrypted HTTP. The question should be challenging, requiring the synthesis of high-level general understanding beyond the specific context provided.\n\nThoughtful consideration leads to the realization that a question about the consequences of using unencrypted HTTP for sensitive transactions could probe the domain expert's understanding of the security vulnerabilities associated with cleartext data transmission.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a high level of difficulty, the question should be designed to test the ability to analyze the situation, understand the risks, and apply knowledge of security principles to real-world scenarios.\n\nThe decision to generate a question based on the provided context is justified because the context contains meaningful, coherent, and educationally valuable content related to the security vulnerabilities of unencrypted HTTP traffic.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the primary security risk associated with sending authentication credentials over unencrypted HTTP, and how can this risk be mitigated?\nA: Data corruption and implementing firewalls\nB: Eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be mitigated by using HTTPS\nC: Server overload and using load balancers\nD: Network congestion and implementing Quality of Service (QoS) policies\n\nExplanation: The primary security risk of sending authentication credentials over unencrypted HTTP is the vulnerability to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and exploit sensitive data.

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

While a\n\nhash may be a one-way function, it is still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John the\n\nRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/){.link} and do exactly that.\n\nJohn the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a simple wordlist.

John the Ripper can also run incrementally though\n\nall the possible character combinations, but it takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,\n\nevery hash in `/etc/shadow`{.literal} is built off of a random number. This number is called a *salt* and is stored with\n\nthe hash. This means that instead of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker must try every\n\npossible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow\n\ntables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table){.link} so that all of the possible hashes have already been\n\ncomputed. These tables may take up terabytes of disk space, but can make cracking even complicated hashes much simpler.\n\n<p>\n\nLet's use a custom utility named\n\n<code class=\"literal\">\n\n[\\`crypt`</code>`{=html}](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/blob/main/labs/hash/crypt.c){.link} to show that we have the\n\nactual password.

Lab: MitM with Scapy {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_mitm_with_scapy}\nIn this lab we will use a fake SSH server, [sshesame](https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame){.link}, and an interactive\n\npacket manipulation program, [scapy](https://scapy.net/){.link}, to disrupt an ongoing SSH session between victim and\n\nserver, position ourself in the middle of the traffic, and capture the username and password victim is using.\n\n:::: table\n\n::: content\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n| Name                                                      | IP Address                                                |\n\n+===========================================================+===========================================================+\n\n| server                                                    | 172.20.0.5                                                |\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n| victim                                                    | 172.20.0.6                                                |\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n| attacker                                                  | 172.20.0.7                                                |\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n: Table 1. IP Addresses Used\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nFor this lab our IP addresses are configured statically and are known to the attacker. It is also assumed that the\n\nattacker is on the local network. Lastly victim has been poorly configured to ignore changes to the host key. This is\n\nnot entirely unreasonable as many users just ignore the warnings and clear out the known_hosts file when prompted\n\nanyway.\n\nStart by downloading the [scapy.zip](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/scapy.zip){.link} file which\n\ncontains the Docker Compose configuration we will be using. Uncompress it to a directory where you have write access.\n\nThis lab will require us to use three terminal windows/tabs: one for the `docker-compose up`{.literal} command which\n\nwill show the output of everything running in the background, one for the victim which will show an SSH session with the\n\nserver, and one for the attacker which we will use to make the attack.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/scapy.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"scapy\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nOpen three terminals and `cd`{.literal} into the directory where you uncompressed the lab zip file in each of them.\n\nThere should be a `docker-compose.yml`{.literal} file and `server`{.literal}, `victim`{.literal}, and\n\n`attacker`{.literal} directories in the directory you are in.\n\nIn the first terminal run the `docker-compose up`{.literal} command to build the images and run the containers:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>PS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\scapy&gt; docker-compose up\n\nCreating network &quot;scapy_testnet&quot; with the default driver\n\nCreating scapy_server_1   ... done\n\nCreating scapy_victim_1   ... done\n\nCreating scapy_attacker_1 ... done\n\nAttaching to scapy_victim_1, scapy_server_1, scapy_attacker_1\n\nserver_1    | &gt; Starting SSHD\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Generating new host keys\n\nscapy_victim_1 exited with code 0\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 No host keys configured, using keys at &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame&quot;\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_rsa_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_ecdsa_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_ed25519_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Listening on [::]:22 \u2460\n\nserver_1    | ssh-keygen: generating new host keys: RSA DSA ECDSA ED25519\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for dsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 1024 MD5:a5:e6:e9:38:d2:2e:88:fd:f0:aa:a8:05:07:35:5f:18 root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | 1024 SHA256:NM7DONpt1doZp4e6WV+6WVVr+KUrh9luUSRcAhnzdyw root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | 1024 SHA512:LHfFdSk1XiAKQArH0CW+RkaKv5GgovPCH7UIQ+P4T2LbgGpCBP5aGA1V3oriYbTZWuS9TlUgDbEfTBq19AV/cA root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for rsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 3072 MD5:74:44:b6:a2:74:b9:7e:1b:ba:3d:27:b8:19:3a:48:df root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | 3072 SHA256:mubm9mLNrdNDk5fyj0dghDBIbbwcVKXo23Qdv61/S/c root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | 3072 SHA512:JFQhS6trY7sNqRSwZ+t0uyBb5ddNh9qSLtBrMaa5G7xWzKHpxCuKBSDbvLk4W9JKeQftTU4293UDV9vqCcf/6w root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for ecdsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 256 MD5:15:75:5f:9b:72:7c:f0:13:ea:0d:b4:47:b7:62:69:63 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA256:4p/Afp/8C2tHn7AePdS7OHCgPxfBamdaLIUg4IJ7xx4 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA512:NnbevqBXFkGQWIirdFsLPnX85q7q/1Y7E4i+BLHLqE3cg2aqkduBJsssyr9+G7bSvq7txvjl9SRmyRAzuDT7DQ root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for ed25519 host key\n\nserver_1    | 256 MD5:ad:00:61:26:4d:a0:07:be:6b:8e:91:bd:f0:65:e6:14 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA256:Vl7jQulDsONglP1xbSN+J8nSfCaIER40rHhgy7z/BYg root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA512:WkmvOWe6oaZ/qE1ZiA0rZAjn9H+hCDxI8NHpsjRNCalK/CgVV9+VhkzHgRTKfKTqQeE0y/Zz2GaEJGv/sapCHg root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: No SSH authorized_keys found!\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Unlocking root account\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: password authentication enabled.\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: password authentication for root user enabled.\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Running: /etc/entrypoint.d/changepw.sh\n\nserver_1    | Running /usr/sbin/sshd -D -e -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nserver_1    | Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22. \u2461\n\nserver_1    | Server listening on :: port 22.</code></pre>\n\n<figcaption>Listing 1. docker-compose up</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* Notice that attacker has a fake SSH server running in the background\n\n2.  *\u2461* Notice that server has a legitimate SSH server running in the background\n\n:::\n\n<aside class=\"admonition note\" title=\"Note\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nIf you receive the error\n\n`failed to create network scapy_testnet: Error response from daemon: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space`{.literal}\n\ncheck to see if you have other containers running and stop them.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nTo generate a highly insightful and probing question-answer pair, let's first analyze the provided context. The context revolves around a lab exercise demonstrating a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack using Scapy to disrupt an ongoing SSH session between a victim and a server. The attacker positions themselves in the middle of the traffic and captures the username and password the victim is using.\n\nThe lab setup involves a fake SSH server (sshesame) and an interactive packet manipulation program (Scapy). The attacker uses Scapy to create and send malicious ARP packets, tricking the victim into sending traffic intended for the server to the attacker instead. This allows the attacker to capture the victim's credentials when they attempt to reconnect to the server via SSH.\n\nGiven this context, we can identify central ideas such as the vulnerability of SSH connections to MitM attacks, the role of ARP spoofing in such attacks, and the importance of secure authentication methods (like using keys instead of passwords) and proper host key management.\n\nConcept exploration reveals underlying themes of network security, the potential for attackers to exploit weaknesses in protocol implementations (like ignoring host key changes), and the significance of educational labs in demonstrating real-world attack scenarios to promote better security practices.\n\nStrategic complexity calibration suggests that a question addressing the mitigation of MitM attacks on SSH connections, considering the specifics of the lab scenario, would be appropriately challenging. It should invite deeper understanding, meaningful reflection, or critical engagement with the content, ensuring the question is purposeful and requires a high level of technical understanding.\n\nGiven these considerations, a question that stands out is related to preventing MitM attacks on SSH connections, focusing on the use of keys versus passwords and the management of host keys.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What security measure can prevent a Man-in-the-Middle attack like the one demonstrated in the lab, where an attacker intercepts and logs a victim's SSH credentials, and how does it mitigate the vulnerability?\nA: Implementing password authentication with complex passwords\nB: Using SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords\nC: Regularly updating the SSH server software\nD: Disabling SSH altogether\n\nExplanation: Using SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords can significantly mitigate the risk of a MitM attack, as an attacker would need to obtain the private key (which is not transmitted over the network) rather than just intercepting a password. Proper management of host keys is also crucial, as ignoring changes to the host key, as seen in the lab setup, can facilitate such attacks.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",

False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings.

The context discusses the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement of security solutions, focusing on the concepts of false positives and false negatives. \n\nFalse positives occur when a security solution detects a threat that does not exist, potentially leading to teams ignoring alerts due to their frequency, thus rendering the security solution ineffective. The key to reducing false positives is to refine the rule set used for triggering warnings, which can be achieved by determining a baseline of normal events and identifying abnormalities that correspond to actual attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, false negatives happen when a security solution fails to identify an existing threat.

The difficulty rating for such a question would be high, around 8 or 9 out of 10, as it requires not only a deep understanding of Unix File Permissions and IAM but also the ability to apply this knowledge in a practical, security-conscious scenario.\n\nThe question should encourage deep engagement with the content, critical reflection on implications, and a clear demonstration of understanding and competency in managing access control in a shared computing environment.\n\nThoughtful consideration and reasoning behind the question generation involve identifying a scenario where understanding and applying Unix File Permissions is critical and then crafting a question that requires the synthesis of high-level general understanding beyond the specific context provided.\n\nGiven these guidelines, the question should be self-contained, clear, and concise, with answer options that are plausible and reasonable, yet challenging to distinguish between, especially for the incorrect options.\n\nThe decision to generate a question is based on the presence of meaningful, coherent, and educationally valuable content within the provided context, which indeed contains significant information about Unix File Permissions and their application in securing sensitive data.\n\nTherefore, the rationale for question generation is well-founded, and the process ensures that the resulting question-answer pair will be highly challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the subject matter and its practical applications.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What command would a system administrator use to change the permissions of a sensitive configuration file to allow the owner to have read, write, and execute permissions, the group to have read and write permissions, and all other users to have no permissions, and then how would they verify these changes?\nA: chmod 630 filename; ls -l filename\nB: chmod 760 filename; ls -l filename\nC: chown owner.group filename; chmod 750 filename; ls -l filename\nD: chmod 710 filename; chown owner.group filename; ls -l filename\n\nExplanation: The correct answer requires understanding how to use the chmod command to set specific permissions for the owner, group, and other users, and then verifying these changes. The chmod command uses octal numbers to represent permissions, where read is 4, write is 2, and execute is 1. The combination of these numbers sets the permissions. For the owner to have read, write, and execute (7), the group to have read and write (6), and others to have no permissions (0), the command would be chmod 760. Verifying the changes involves using ls -l to list the file's permissions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n</output_format>",
