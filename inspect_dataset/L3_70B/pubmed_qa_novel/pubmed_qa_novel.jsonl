    "context": "Currently, a 'pedagogical gap' exists in distributed medical education in that distance educators teach medical students but typically do not have the opportunity to assess them in large-scale examinations such as the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). We developed a remote examiner OSCE (reOSCE) that was integrated into a traditional OSCE to establish whether remote examination technology may be used to bridge this gap. The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method.\n\nForty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students.\n\nStatistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78).

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\n\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\n\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group.

A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up.

We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003.\n\nUsing a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care).\n\nInitially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.

    "context": "It is widely accepted that exemplary surgical care involves a surgeon's involvement in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative periods. In an era of ever-expanding therapeutic modalities available to the vascular surgeon, it is important that trainees gain experience in preoperative decision-making and how this affects a patient's operative and postoperative course. The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the continuity of care they are able to provide for patients and the factors affecting this experience.\n\nThis prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and conducted at the University of British Columbia during January 2005. All patients who underwent a vascular procedure at either of the two teaching hospitals were included. In addition to type of case (emergent, outpatient, inpatient), resident demographic data and involvement in each patient's care (preoperative assessment, postoperative daily assessment, and follow-up clinic assessment) were recorded. Categoric data were analyzed with the chi2 test.\n\nThe study included 159 cases, of which 65% were elective same-day admission patients, 20% were elective previously admitted patients; and 15% were emergent. The overall rate of preoperative assessment was 67%, involvement in the decision to operate, 17%; postoperative assessment on the ward, 79%; and patient follow-up in clinic, 3%. The rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (assessing patient pre-op and post-op) was 57%. Emergent cases were associated with a significantly higher rate of preoperative assessment (92% vs 63%, P<.05). For elective cases admitted before the day of surgery compared with same-day admission patients, the rates of preoperative assessment (78% vs 58%, P<.05) and involvement in the decision to operate (16% vs 4%, P<.05) were significantly higher.\n\n",

    "context": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\n\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\n\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009).

Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV.

The study included patients with ET, normal volunteers (NV), and patients with PD, focusing on the semi-quantitative analysis of DaTSCAN data to compare radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum, caudate nucleus, and putamen among these groups.\n\nThe key findings from the study indicate that while qualitative interpretation of SPECT data showed no difference in radiopharmaceutical uptake between NV and ET patients, semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences, particularly a reduced uptake in the striatum of ET patients compared to NV. Additionally, patients with PD showed reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical in the putamen, which correlated with the side of motor symptom presentation.\n\nThe clinical follow-up of ET patients showed no significant change in clinical presentation towards PD in most cases, with DaTSCAN follow-up confirming the absence of dopaminergic degeneration in all but one patient, who had an equivocal baseline study that deteriorated over time.\n\nGiven the complexity and the nuanced differences in diagnosis and progression between ET and PD, the question should aim to probe the understanding of these nuances, the role of DaTSCAN in differential diagnosis, and the implications of the study's findings for clinical practice.\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the primary implication of reduced radiopharmaceutical uptake in the putamen, as observed in Parkinson's disease patients via DaTSCAN, for the differential diagnosis from essential tremor?\nA: It confirms the presence of essential tremor.\nB: It indicates dopaminergic degeneration characteristic of Parkinson's disease.\nC: It suggests a need for further neurological examination.\nD: It rules out the possibility of parkinsonism in patients with tremors.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer, B, reflects the understanding that reduced radiopharmaceutical uptake in the putamen, as identified by DaTSCAN, is indicative of dopaminergic degeneration. This is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and aids in differentiating it from essential tremor, where such degeneration is not typically observed.

Among sisters, the corresponding proportions were 70% and 88%, respectively (p = 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, daughters and sisters of a proband with poor prognosis had a 60% higher 5-year breast cancer mortality compared to those of a proband with good prognosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.2; p for trend 0.002). This association was slightly stronger among sisters (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.4) than among daughters (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3).\n\n",

    "context": "The combined use of free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in early detection of prostate cancer has been controversial. This article systematically evaluates the discriminating capacity of a large number of combination tests.\n\nFree and total PSA were analyzed in stored serum samples taken prior to diagnosis in 429 cases and 1,640 controls from the Physicians' Health Study. We used a classification algorithm called logic regression to search for clinically useful tests combining total and percent free PSA and receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared these tests with those based on total and complexed PSA. Data were divided into training and test subsets. For robustness, we considered 35 test-train splits of the original data and computed receiver operating characteristic curves for each test data set.\n\nThe average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across test data sets was 0.74 for total PSA and 0.76 for the combination tests. Combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA>4.0 ng/mL were identified 29 out of 35 times. All these tests extended the PSA reflex range to below 4.0 ng/mL. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the overall diagnostic performance as expressed by the area under the curve did not differ significantly for the different tests.\n\n",

The analysis involves a classification algorithm and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the discriminating capacity of various combination tests. The key aspect of this context is the assessment of the area under the ROC curve as a measure of the diagnostic performance of these tests.\n\nUpon examining the context, it becomes clear that the area under the ROC curve is a critical metric for evaluating the effectiveness of different PSA tests in distinguishing between cases and controls. The fact that the average area under the ROC curve for total PSA is 0.74 and slightly higher for combination tests (0.76) suggests that while there is some discriminatory power, there is also room for improvement. The identification of combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than the traditional PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL, which can extend the diagnostic range below this threshold, underscores the potential for refining diagnostic strategies.\n\nGiven the emphasis on the area under the ROC curve as a measure of diagnostic performance, a thoughtful and challenging question would probe the understanding of this metric and its implications for clinical practice. The question should encourage reflection on what the area under the ROC curve signifies about a test's ability to discriminate between those with and without the disease, and how this information can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe thought process behind generating this question involves recognizing the central role of the ROC curve analysis in assessing diagnostic tests and understanding that the area under this curve provides a quantitative measure of a test's discriminatory power. This leads to considering how changes in the area under the curve might reflect improvements or declines in diagnostic performance, and how clinicians might use this information to make informed decisions about test selection and interpretation.\n\nDifficulty rating: 8/10\n\nThis question is designed to be challenging because it requires not only an understanding of the ROC curve and its application in evaluating diagnostic tests but also the ability to think critically about how changes in the area under the curve reflect changes in diagnostic performance.

However, few studies concerning the association between failure of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and PTS have been published. The objective of this study was to explore the association between the failure of ACLR and PTS at a minimum of two years follow-up.\n\nTwo hundred and thirty eight eligible patients from June 2009 to October 2010 were identified from our database. A total of 20 failure cases of ACLR and 20 randomly selected controls were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the results of manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 arthrometer at 30\u00b0 of knee flexion and pivot-shift test before the ACLR and at the final follow-up were collected. The medial and lateral PTSs were measured using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, based on Hudek's measurement. A comparison of PTS between the two groups was performed.\n\nThe overall failure rate of the present study was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1\u00b0 \u00b1 3.2\u00b0 and the mean lateral PTS was 4.6\u00b0 \u00b1 2.6\u00b0.

The study analyzed data from 3406 cases of gynaecological cancer in the Anglia region from 1996 to 2003. The results showed a significant improvement in survival rates from 2000 to 2003, which coincided with the implementation of the DH guidance. However, the study's limitations and potential biases need to be considered, such as the reliance on data from a specific region and the potential for confounding variables.\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the study's findings may be influenced by various factors, including changes in treatment protocols, improvements in healthcare infrastructure, or shifts in patient demographics.

Our study sought to compare mental health indicators between Francophones and non-Francophones living in the province of Manitoba.\n\nTwo populations were used: one from administrative datasets housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy and the other from representative survey samples. The administrative datasets contained data from physician billings, hospitalizations, prescription drug use, education, and social services use, and surveys included indicators on language variables and on self-rated health.\n\nOutside urban areas, Francophones had lower rates of diagnosed substance use disorder (rate ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and of suicide and suicide attempts (RR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79), compared with non-Francophones, but no differences were found between the groups across the province in rates of diagnosed mood disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, or any mental disorders after adjusting for age, sex, and geographic area.

    "context": "Cerebral hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure undergone to control intractable seizures, is becoming a standard procedure with more cases identified and treated early in life [33]. While the effect of the dominant hemisphere resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.\n\nSeven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2].\n\nWe found that about 60% of our group developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range. Phonological processing measured by both phonological awareness and nonword reading was unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants. Phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory, a component of phonological processing skills, together with receptive vocabulary size, positively correlated with reading levels similar to those reported in average readers. Receptive vocabulary, a bilateral function, was preserved to a certain degree similar to that of strongly left-lateralized phonological skills [3]. Later seizure onset was associated with better reading levels.\n\n",

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images.\n\nUsing scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nTwo hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined.

The context discusses a randomized clinical trial investigating the effect of bracket-ligature combinations on orthodontic space closure over three months. The trial involved three groups, each using a different bracket-ligature combination, and measured the mean amount of space closure as the primary outcome.

The context discusses racial differences in asthma care, specifically focusing on the accuracy of physician estimates of asthma severity and its relation to disparities in care. \n\nThe key findings include that black patients are more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by physicians compared to white patients, and this underestimation is associated with poorer quality asthma care, including less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids, less instruction on managing asthma flare-ups, and lower ratings of asthma care and physician communication.\n\nGiven these points, the question should invite deeper understanding and critical engagement with the content, particularly focusing on the criteria for classifying physician estimates as underestimates of asthma severity. \n\nA thoughtful question could explore the specific conditions or factors that lead to the classification of a physician's estimate as an underestimate, especially in the context of racial disparities in asthma care. This requires considering implicit assumptions about what constitutes an \"underestimate\" and how such underestimates impact patient care.\n\nStrategically calibrating the complexity, the question should be challenging enough to encourage reflection on the implications of these underestimates for asthma management and patient outcomes, without being so straightforward that it fails to provoke deeper thought.\n\nIntentional question planning involves ensuring the question is purposeful, encourages meaningful reflection, and critically engages with the content.

    "context": "The gap between evidence-based treatments and routine care has been well established. Findings from the Sequenced Treatments Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) emphasized the importance of measurement-based care for the treatment of depression as a key ingredient for achieving response and remission; yet measurement-based care approaches are not commonly used in clinical practice.\n\nThe Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for monitoring depression severity was introduced in 19 diverse psychiatric practices. During the one-year course of the project the helpfulness and feasibility of implementation of PHQ-9 in these psychiatric practices were studied. The project was modeled after the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series. Two of the 19 practices dropped out during the course of the project.\n\nBy the conclusion of the study, all remaining 17 practices had adopted PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care in their practice. On the basis of responses from 17 psychiatrists from those practices, PHQ-9 scores influenced clinical decision making for 93% of 6,096 patient contacts. With the additional information gained from the PHQ-9 score, one or more treatment changes occurred during 40% of these clinical contacts. Changing the dosage of antidepressant medication and adding another medication were the most common treatment changes recorded by psychiatrists, followed by starting or increasing psychotherapy and by switching or initiating antidepressants. In 3% of the patient contacts, using the PHQ-9 led to additional suicide risk assessment.\n\n",

The study introduced PHQ-9 in 19 diverse psychiatric practices and evaluated its helpfulness and feasibility over a one-year period. Key findings include the adoption of PHQ-9 by all remaining 17 practices after two dropped out, and its significant influence on clinical decision-making, with treatment changes occurring in 40% of patient contacts. The PHQ-9 scores led to various treatment adjustments, including dosage changes of antidepressant medication, addition of another medication, initiation or increase of psychotherapy, and switching or initiating antidepressants. In a small percentage of cases, the PHQ-9 also prompted additional suicide risk assessments.\n\nGiven the context's focus on the practical application and impact of the PHQ-9 in psychiatric care, a challenging question would require domain experts to reflect on the broader implications of measurement-based care and the PHQ-9's role within it. The question should encourage consideration of how the PHQ-9 influences treatment outcomes and patient care pathways, beyond its immediate effects on treatment decisions.\n\nThoughtful consideration of the context reveals that while the PHQ-9 is shown to significantly impact clinical decision-making, the long-term effects of its implementation on patient outcomes and the sustainability of measurement-based care approaches in psychiatric practices are not explicitly addressed.

This study was undertaken to assess the p53, PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic inflammation.\n\nSections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining.\n\np53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001).

    "context": "Because of the inflammatory nature of Crohn's disease, ileocolic resections are often difficult to perform, especially if an abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis is present. Our goal was to determine whether the above factors are contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1996, 46 laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections were attempted. Fourteen patients had an abscess or phlegmon treated with bowel rest before operation (group I), 10 patients had recurrent Crohn's disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis (group II), and 22 patients had no previous operation and no phlegmon or abscess associated with their disease (group III). These groups were compared with each other and with 70 consecutive open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease during the same time period (group IV).\n\nOperative blood loss and time were greater in group IV than in groups I, II, and III (245 versus 151, 131, and 195 ml, respectively, and 202 versus 152, 144, and 139 minutes, respectively). Conversion to open procedure occurred in 5 patients (group I, 1 [7%]; group II, 2 [20%]; group III, 2 [9%]). Morbidity was highest in group IV (21% versus 0%, 10%, and 10%, respectively). Only one patient died (group IV, 1%). Length of hospital stay was longest in group IV (7.9 versus 4.8, 3.9, and 4.5 days, respectively).\n\n",

The study categorizes patients into four groups based on the presence of abscess or phlegmon, recurrent disease, and previous operations. \n\nUpon analyzing the context, it becomes evident that the primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in challenging cases, such as those with abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease, and to compare these outcomes with open ileocolic resections.\n\nThe context highlights significant differences in operative blood loss, time, morbidity, and length of hospital stay between laparoscopic-assisted and open ileocolic resections, suggesting that laparoscopic approaches may offer advantages in terms of reduced hospital stay and morbidity for patients with Crohn's disease.\n\nGiven the detailed comparison and the specific focus on the length of hospital stay, a thoughtful and probing question can be crafted to assess the understanding and competency of a domain expert in this area.\n\nThoughtful engagement with the content reveals that the comparison of length of hospital stay is a critical aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of laparoscopic-assisted versus open ileocolic resections. Therefore, a question that encourages deep reflection on the implications of these findings and requires the synthesis of high-level general understanding would be highly appropriate.\n\nThe question should be designed to challenge even the smartest domain experts, necessitating a deep understanding of the content and its implications for clinical practice.

This reduction in morbidity directly correlates with the shorter length of hospital stay observed in the laparoscopic groups. While reduced operative blood loss and shorter operative time are also benefits of laparoscopic-assisted resections, they are not the primary factors contributing to the reduced hospital stay.

    "context": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\n\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\n\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\n\n",

The effectiveness of a school food policy is affected by the content of the policy, its implementation and its support by parents, teachers and principals. The aim of this study is to detect opportunities to improve the school food policy and/or implementation at Dutch primary schools. Therefore, this study explores the school food policy and investigates schools' (teachers and principals) and parents' opinion on the school food policy.\n\nData on the schools' perspective of the food policy was collected from principals and teachers by means of semi-structured interviews. In total 74 principals and 72 teachers from 83 Dutch primary schools were interviewed. Data on parental perceptions about the school food policy were based on a cross-sectional survey among 1,429 parents from the same schools.\n\nMost principals (87.1%) reported that their school had a written food policy; however in most cases the rules were not clearly defined.
