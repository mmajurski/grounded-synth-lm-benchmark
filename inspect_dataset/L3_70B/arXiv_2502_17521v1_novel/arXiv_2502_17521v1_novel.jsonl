Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials. Repeat Trials quantifies the expected number of transformation trials required to fully regenerate an existing transformed dataset Ti\u2062(\ud835\udc9f)subscript\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc9fT\\_{i}(\\mathcal{D})italic\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( caligraphic\\_D ), providing insight into the benchmark\u2019s ability to produce novel variations.\n\nThese metrics help assess whether a dynamic benchmark remains effective in evaluating LLM capabilities, even when exposed to potential training data contamination.\n",

This overlap can potentially limit the benchmark's ability to generate novel and diverse test cases, thereby contaminating the data.\n\nThe key ideas here include the importance of transparency in benchmarking, the risk of data contamination when benchmarks are used to train LLMs, and the metrics proposed to quantify collision, such as Collision Rate and Repeat Trials. These metrics are crucial for assessing the robustness and effectiveness of a dynamic benchmark in evaluating LLM capabilities despite potential contamination.\n\nGiven the complexity and the specific focus on dynamic benchmarking and data contamination, the question should aim to challenge the domain expert's understanding of how dynamic benchmarking strategies mitigate the challenges of balancing transparency with the prevention of data contamination.

For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al.

(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains.

To generate a question that encourages deep engagement and nuanced understanding, we must first identify the central ideas and significant relationships within the context. \n\nThe context mentions several methods for rewriting samples from existing static benchmarks, including Auto-Dataset, StructEval, ITD, and VarBench. Each of these methods employs LLMs (Large Language Models) in different ways to generate new samples or rewrite contaminated ones. ITD is unique in its approach as it utilizes a contamination detector to identify contaminated samples and then rewrites them while preserving their difficulty levels.\n\nThe key concept here is the preservation of difficulty levels, which suggests that the quality of the training dataset is heavily dependent on maintaining the cognitive challenge presented by the original samples. This implies that simply rewriting samples without considering their difficulty levels could potentially degrade the quality of the training dataset.\n\nGiven this understanding, the question should probe the domain expert's knowledge on the implications of preserving difficulty levels and the potential consequences of not doing so.

As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

First, static benchmarks become less effective as training corpora grow. The probability of contamination increases with Prcontam\u221d|\ud835\udc9ftrain|\u22c5|\ud835\udc9ftest|\u22121proportional-tosubscriptPrcontam\u22c5subscript\ud835\udc9ftrainsuperscriptsubscript\ud835\udc9ftest1\\text{Pr}\\_{\\text{contam}}\\propto|\\mathcal{D}\\_{\\text{train}}|\\cdot|\\mathcal{D}\\_%\n\n{\\text{test}}|^{-1}Pr start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT contam end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT \u221d | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT train end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | \u22c5 | caligraphic\\_D start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT test end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT | start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, rendering traditional benchmarks outdated for models trained on web-scale data. Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n",

(2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nThe paper is structured as illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

For example, human annotation of LatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) shows that about 10% of samples suffer from faithfulness and answerability issues, compromising evaluation reliability. Moreover, in interactive evaluation, reliability largely depends on the interviewer LLM, which generates questions and assigns scores.\n\n\n##### 4.3.4 Hybrid Generation\nLatestEval\u00a0(Li et\u00a0al., 2023d) combines temporal cutoff and LLM-based generation to automatically generate reading comprehension datasets using LLMs on real-time content from sources such as BBC.\n\nDARG\u00a0(Zhang et\u00a0al., 2024b) integrates LLM-based and graph-based generation.

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria.

Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications.

However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task.
