The piece involves the manipulation of electric metronomes, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions.  It is a very theatrical piece, and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with Fluxus, an experimental art movement from the sixties.  The only true scored \"instrument\" is an electric metronome for each individual player, though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer.  Because the graphic notation of score (which is a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths) leaves a lot of room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced.  There is no conductor for the performance.  It has been recorded on the album \"Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's & 1990's\".  In a review of a performance by the S.E.M.
