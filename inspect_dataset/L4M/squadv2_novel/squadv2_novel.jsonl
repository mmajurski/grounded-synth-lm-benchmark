    "context": "In 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.",

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context revolves around the bedchamber crisis of 1839, a significant political event during Queen Victoria's early reign. The crisis was triggered when Sir Robert Peel, commissioned to form a new ministry after Melbourne's resignation, expected to replace the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber, who were predominantly wives of Whigs, with wives of Tories. Queen Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to this replacement, leading to Peel's resignation. This event highlights the political implications of the monarch's influence on the governance structure, particularly the tension between the monarch's personal preferences and the prime minister's authority in appointing members of the Royal Household.\n\nUpon analyzing the context, it becomes clear that the bedchamber crisis was not merely a trivial matter of court appointments but a significant constitutional issue. It tested the boundaries of the monarch's power versus the prime minister's authority and set a precedent for the governance structure. The crisis underscored the complexities of the political landscape during Victoria's reign, particularly the interplay between the monarch, the prime minister, and the political parties.\n\nTo generate a question that probes the domain expert's knowledge and encourages deep engagement with the content, we need to focus on the political implications and the constitutional nuances highlighted by the bedchamber crisis. The question should require a nuanced understanding of the event's context and its broader implications on the governance structure and the monarch's influence.\n\nThe thought process involves identifying the central theme of the bedchamber crisis, understanding its political context, and recognizing its significance in the broader narrative of Queen Victoria's reign and British constitutional history. The question should be crafted to challenge the domain expert's ability to analyze the event's implications and its relevance to the governance structure.\n\nGiven the context and the topic, a suitable question would be one that requires the domain expert to reflect on the constitutional implications of the bedchamber crisis and its impact on the monarch's role in governance.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What was the significant constitutional implication of the bedchamber crisis of 1839 regarding the monarch's influence on governance?\nA: The crisis established the prime minister's absolute authority over the Royal Household appointments.\nB: The crisis marked a significant reduction in the monarch's ability to influence government composition.\nC: The crisis highlighted the monarch's discretion in accepting or rejecting the prime minister's recommendations for key appointments.\nD: The crisis led to the abolition of the monarchy's role in governmental appointments.\n\nExplanation: The bedchamber crisis demonstrated the monarch's ability to exert influence over governmental appointments and composition, as seen in Queen Victoria's objection to replacing her ladies of the bedchamber.

    "context": "Multiracial Americans are Americans who have mixed ancestry of \"two or more races\". The term may also include Americans of mixed-race ancestry who self-identify with just one group culturally and socially (cf. the one-drop rule). In the 2010 US census, approximately 9 million individuals, or 2.9% of the population, self-identified as multiracial. There is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number, but people live according to social and cultural identities, not DNA. Historical reasons, including slavery creating a racial caste and the European-American suppression of Native Americans, often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity, generally that of the culture in which they were raised. Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities. While many Americans may be biologically multiracial, they often do not know it or do not identify so culturally, any more than they maintain all the differing traditions of a variety of national ancestries.",

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \"Munshi\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

    "context": "Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects. Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis. Common side-effects include diarrhea, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora, and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe context provides a detailed analysis of the Denver Broncos' offensive performance during a particular season, focusing on key statistics and player contributions. The central ideas revolve around the quarterback play, receiving and rushing statistics, and the overall offensive ranking. \n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The context highlights the performance of quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler, detailing their passing yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and passer ratings. It also examines the contributions of key receivers (Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, Owen Daniels) and running backs (C. J. Anderson, Ronnie Hillman), providing statistics on their receptions, yards, and touchdowns. The overall offensive performance is summarized by their ranking in scoring and the total points scored.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The information implicitly assumes that the reader is familiar with American football terminology and statistics. The underlying theory involves understanding how different positions contribute to a team's overall offensive performance. For instance, quarterback play is crucial as it directly affects the team's ability to score through passing. The performance of receivers and running backs is also vital as they are the primary recipients of passes and executors of rushing plays.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: The difficulty level of a question generated from this context can be calibrated to be high (around 8-9) by focusing on nuanced aspects such as comparing player contributions across different positions or analyzing the impact of quarterback performance on the team's overall scoring.\n\n4. **Intentional Question Planning**: A potential question could invite deeper understanding by asking how the statistics provided relate to the team's overall ranking in scoring. This encourages reflection on the relative importance of different offensive statistics and how they cumulatively affect the team's performance.\n\nUpon analyzing the context, it is clear that the information is meaningful, coherent, and educationally valuable, focusing on the offensive performance of the Denver Broncos.

J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman were insufficient to elevate the team's ranking.\nD: The lack of Pro Bowl selections among the offensive players reflected a lack of elite talent that could make decisive plays.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer, A, is supported by the fact that Peyton Manning had a career-low passer rating of 67.9, which is significantly lower than Brock Osweiler's 86.4. Manning's lower passer rating and higher number of interceptions (17 vs 6 by Osweiler) likely had a substantial impact on the team's overall offensive performance. Although Osweiler's statistics are better in terms of touchdowns and interceptions, Manning's overall performance was more significant due to his higher volume of attempts. The team's 19th ranking in scoring offense can be partly attributed to Manning's subpar performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n</output_format>\n\nThe best answer is directly supported by the context and requires a deep understanding of how quarterback performance affects a team's offensive ranking.

The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories.

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \"Munshi\": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.

    "response": "<document_analysis>\nThe provided context discusses the Denver Broncos' victories in the divisional round and the AFC Championship Game during the NFL playoffs. The focus is on their win against the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, where they won 20\u201318. The decisive moment came when the Broncos intercepted a pass on New England's 2-point conversion attempt with 17 seconds left. To generate a question that probes domain expert knowledge about the defensive strategy employed by the Broncos against the Patriots, we need to analyze the information given and infer the defensive strategy from the details provided.\n\nThe context highlights a crucial defensive play: intercepting a pass on a 2-point conversion attempt. This indicates that the Broncos' defensive strategy was effective in critical situations, particularly in stopping the Patriots' attempt to tie or take the lead late in the game. The fact that the Broncos won by a narrow margin (20\u201318) suggests that the game was closely contested, and the defensive play was pivotal.\n\nTo create a challenging question, we should consider what defensive strategies could lead to such an outcome. The question should encourage reflection on the implications of the Broncos' defensive actions and demonstrate an understanding of football strategies.\n\nGiven the context, a plausible question could revolve around the defensive strategy that led to the interception on the 2-point conversion attempt.

    "context": "In 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.",

    "context": "Palmerston died in 1865, and after a brief ministry led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. \"Everyone likes flattery,\" he said, \"and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" With the phrase \"we authors, Ma'am\", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were \"a public meeting rather than a woman\".",

A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through.

In addition, social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to \"pass\" as white. Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States, such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day). Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial. In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American.",

The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.

In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. \"Everyone likes flattery,\" he said, \"and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\" With the phrase \"we authors, Ma'am\", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were \"a public meeting rather than a woman\".",

To generate a meaningful question, we need to understand the significance of the event and its relation to the venues selected.\n\nFirst, let's identify the event. Although the context doesn't explicitly mention the event, it is likely referring to a major sports event, possibly a Super Bowl given the mention of stadiums typically associated with large events.\n\nThe significance of the event can be inferred from the caliber of the venues. All three venues are large and well-known, suggesting that the event is of considerable importance.\n\nTo create a challenging question, we need to consider the characteristics of the venues and their potential relation to the event. The venues are all major sports stadiums, but they differ in location and the types of events they typically host.\n\nLet's examine the implicit assumptions and subtle details:\n1.

On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday, 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.

Queen Victoria had pre-planned her funeral, specifying it to be military in nature and using white instead of black, reflecting her status and personal preferences.\n2. The funeral included various personal and familial mementos, indicating her strong emotional connections and the sentimental value attached to certain individuals and items.\n3. The inclusion of specific items, such as John Brown's hair and a picture of him, along with his mother's wedding ring, suggests a deep and personal connection between Queen Victoria and John Brown.\n4.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

It mentions that after Albert's death in 1861, Victoria went into deep mourning, avoided public appearances, and as a result, republicanism gained strength temporarily. However, her popularity recovered in the latter half of her reign.\n\nThe central idea here is the significant impact of Prince Albert's death on Queen Victoria's public life and the political implications of her subsequent seclusion.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

It also mentions the discrepancy between the parish baptismal record's date of birth and the date used by Chopin and his family.\n\n1. **Thoughtful Content Examination**: The central idea here revolves around Chopin's birth details and the historical context of his birthplace. The text mentions that Chopin was born in \u017belazowa Wola, which was part of the Duchy of Warsaw, a state established by Napoleon. This establishes a connection between Chopin's birthplace and significant historical events or figures.\n\n2. **Concept Exploration**: The Duchy of Warsaw, being a Polish state established by Napoleon, implies that Chopin's birthplace was under the influence of Napoleon's conquests and the reorganization of Europe during the early 19th century. This historical context is crucial for understanding the cultural, political, and social environment of Chopin's early life.\n\n3. **Strategic Complexity Calibration**: To ensure a high level of difficulty, the question should require a deep understanding of the historical context and its implications on Chopin's life or work.

To generate a challenging question related to the statistical breakdown of the team's rushing and receiving yards, we need to analyze the given data carefully.\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant information:\n- C. J. Anderson rushed for 863 yards and caught 25 passes for 183 yards.\n- Ronnie Hillman rushed for 720 yards and caught 24 passes for an unspecified total yardage.\n\nThe total rushing yards for the team can be calculated by summing the rushing yards of C. J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman, which gives us 863 + 720 = 1,583 yards.\n\nThe total receiving yards for the running backs can be calculated by summing their receiving yards. C. J. Anderson had 183 yards, and while Ronnie Hillman's total receiving yards are not directly provided, we know he had 24 receptions. To assess the total receiving yards for the running backs, we need to make an assumption or inference about Ronnie Hillman's receiving yards.\n\nLet's examine the provided data again to see if we can infer or directly obtain the required information to formulate a challenging question.\n\nTo create a question that probes the domain expert's knowledge, we need to delve into the specifics of the statistical breakdown. One potential area of inquiry is the comparison or aggregation of the rushing and receiving statistics.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that the context provides detailed statistics for the team's leading receivers and rushers. Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders were the top receivers, with 1,304 and 1,135 yards, respectively. The total receiving yards for the team can be estimated by summing the receiving yards of the mentioned players: Demaryius Thomas (1,304 yards), Emmanuel Sanders (1,135 yards), and Owen Daniels (517 yards), along with other receivers not specified. C. J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman also contributed to the receiving yards.\n\nTo formulate a challenging question, let's consider the total receiving yards and the contribution of the running backs to it.\n\nThought Process:\n1. Calculate the total receiving yards for the explicitly mentioned receivers: Demaryius Thomas (1,304 yards) + Emmanuel Sanders (1,135 yards) + Owen Daniels (517 yards) = 2,956 yards.\n2. Note that C. J. Anderson had 183 receiving yards, and Ronnie Hillman had an unspecified number of receiving yards from 24 receptions.\n3. Recognize that the total receiving yards for the team is not directly given but can be inferred to be at least 2,956 yards (from the mentioned receivers) plus additional yards from other receivers and the receiving yards of Ronnie Hillman.\n\nA challenging question could involve comparing the rushing yards to the receiving yards or analyzing the distribution of yards among different positions.\n\nQuestion Formulation:\nLet's create a question that challenges the domain expert to analyze the statistical breakdown of the team's rushing and receiving yards.\n\nQuestion: What is the approximate ratio of the total rushing yards to the total receiving yards for the team?\nA: 1:2\nB: 1:3\nC: 2:3\nD: 3:5\n\nTo answer this question, we need to estimate the total receiving yards and compare it to the total rushing yards (1,583 yards).\n\nGiven that the total receiving yards for Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders, and Owen Daniels alone amount to 2,956 yards, and adding the receiving yards of C. J. Anderson (183 yards) and an estimate for Ronnie Hillman's receiving yards, the total receiving yards will significantly exceed 3,000 yards. Assuming Ronnie Hillman's 24 receptions averaged around 4-5 yards per reception (similar to his rushing average), his receiving yards would be approximately 100 yards (using 4.7 yards/carry as a rough estimate for receiving yards per reception). Thus, the total receiving yards would be roughly 2,956 + 183 + 100 = 3,239 yards.\n\nThe ratio of total rushing yards to total receiving yards is approximately 1,583 : 3,239, which simplifies to roughly 1:2.\n\n</document_analysis>\n\n<output_format>\nQuestion: What is the approximate ratio of the total rushing yards to the total receiving yards for the team?\nA: 1:2\nB: 1:3\nC: 2:3\nD: 3:5\nExplanation: The total rushing yards are 1,583.
