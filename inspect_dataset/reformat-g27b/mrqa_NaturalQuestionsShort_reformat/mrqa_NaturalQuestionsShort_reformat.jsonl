    "context": "<P> Article Five of the United States Constitution describes the process whereby the Constitution , the nation 's frame of government , may be altered . Altering the Constitution consists of proposing an amendment or amendments and subsequent ratification . Amendments may be proposed either by the Congress with a two - thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a convention of states called for by two - thirds of the state legislatures . To become part of the Constitution , an amendment must be ratified by either -- as determined by Congress -- the legislatures of three - quarters of the states or state ratifying conventions in three - quarters of the states .

    "response": "```xml\n<document_analysis>\n<thought_process>The original question is very basic and doesn't challenge a domain expert. The context provides a clear description of Article V, focusing on the amendment process. I will rephrase the question to be more analytical, focusing on the two methods of proposing amendments and the two methods of ratification, and the equal weight given to each state\u2019s vote. I will ensure the answer options are distinct and require a nuanced understanding of the amendment process.
