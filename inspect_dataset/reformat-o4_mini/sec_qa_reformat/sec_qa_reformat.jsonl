      "D": "SSH transmits data in a more efficient format than Telnet."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "SSH (Secure Shell) is preferred over Telnet for secure remote administration because it encrypts the entire session, including login credentials and transmitted data. This encryption prevents eavesdropping and keeps the communication confidential, unlike Telnet, which transmits data in plaintext and is susceptible to interception.",
