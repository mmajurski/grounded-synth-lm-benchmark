Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford , Manchester , England , leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat - trick in South Africa 's first and second innings , both taken on 28 May 1912 . He completed both hat - tricks by dismissing South Africa 's Tommy Ward . Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat - trick : Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble ( two years apart , between the same teams at the same ground ) , Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram ( just over a week apart , in consecutive matches between the same teams ) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad . Three players have taken a hat - trick on their Test debut : English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930 , New Zealand off - spinner Peter Petherick in 1976 , and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994 . Geoff Griffin took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat - trick , taking only eight wickets in his entire Test career . During the match in which he took his hat - trick , Griffin was repeatedly called for throwing by the umpires and never bowled again in a Test match . Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat - trick on his birthday , and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat - trick in the same Test match . </P>",
