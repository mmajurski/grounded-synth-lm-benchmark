Unauthorized\n\naccess is when an actor gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access. The system is often used\n\nin an unintended manner to provide such access. Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others\n\nhaving access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information security typically falls under the\n\nrisk-management plan of a company and its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that\n\ninformation technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated from a basic service provider to directorships with\n\na seat at the highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT assets have become the most\n\nvaluable things many companies own. Guarding these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of\n\ninformation security professionals.\n\n*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to help an attacker gain access to a system. Many\n\ntypes of malicious software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that cause harm to a computer\n\nsystem or network. In the case of many attacks, *system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means the system will no longer be able to perform its\n\nintended purpose. System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.\n\n:::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.2.

    "context": "## 1.2. Learning the Lingo {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__learning_the_lingo}\nIn general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse vocabulary. Unfortunately security is no exception\n\nto this rule. Three of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are *CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.1. CIA\"}\n\n\n### 1.2.1. CIA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__cia}\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/cia.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cia\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhile the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in information security, for our purposes CIA is an\n\nacronym used to remember the three foundational information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and\n\navailability. These ideas form the cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.\n\n*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores\n\ncredit card numbers (a questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be kept *confidential*. You\n\nwould not want other users of the site or outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be taken\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at this point it is enough to understand that maintaining\n\nconfidentiality is a principle of security.\n\n*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously,\n\ndata is very valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and reliable? In security we strive to\n\nmaintain integrity so that the system and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be trusted. Imagine\n\nthat e-commerce site again. What would happen if an attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the\n\nsystem? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and honest customers would not receive what they\n\nordered, all because of an integrity violation.\n\n*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to ensure that valid users have access to the data when\n\nneeded. In the simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply taking the system off line and\n\nnot allowing any access. Such a system would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are designed to\n\nbe accessible and part of your security plan should be ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of\n\nimplementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the resources are available to keep the system working. In\n\nan extreme case, denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By keeping this principle in mind,\n\nhopefully you can mitigate some of those risks.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.2. AAA\"}\n"

AAA {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__aaa}\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/aaa.svg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"aaa\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nAnother acronym you're going to encounter in many different contexts is AAA. It stands for *Authentication*,\n\n*Authorization*, and *Accounting* and it is used in designing and implementing protocols. These concepts should be\n\nremembered when designing security plans.\n\nAuthentication is the process of confirming someone's identity. This may be done with user names and passwords or more\n\nfrequently via multi-factor authentication (MFA) which requires not only something you know, but something you have\n\n(fingerprints, key fob, etc.).\n\nAuthorization refers to keeping track of which resources an entity has access to. This can be done via a permission\n\nscheme or access control list (ACL). Occasionally you will encounter something more exotic where authorization limits\n\nusers to interactions during a particular time of day or from a particular IP address.\n\nAccounting refers to tracking the usage of resources. This may be as simple as noting in a log file when a user has\n\nlogged in to keeping track of exactly which services and user uses and how long they use them. Accounting is incredibly\n\nimportant because it allows you to not only monitor for possible problems, but also inspect what has occurred *after* a\n\nproblem is encountered. Accounting also allows system administrators to show irrefutably what actions a user has taken.\n\nThis can be very important evidence in a court of law.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"1.2.3.

Increasingly security experts are not being asked to analyze a single system, but a network of hundreds if not\n\nthousands of systems. In this case you should make use of scripts and tools to make sure you are not manually doing the\n\nsame thing over and over. Have you found a good way of testing to see if a part of a system is secure? Put it in a\n\nscript so that you can reuse the test on other systems. This same logic applies to how systems are designed. Do you have\n\na database of user login info? Reuse that database across multiple systems.

    "context": "## 1.3. Hacker Culture {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__hacker_culture}\nThe term *hacker* comes from the sound that programmers would make when typing or *hacking* away at keyboards.\n\nOriginally a hacker was anyone who worked feverishly at a problem on a computer and the term *cracker* was used to\n\ndefine people who attempted to bypass security systems. The distinction was eventually lost and a hacker has come to be\n\nthe popular term for someone attempting to gain unauthorized access to data. For an interesting glimpse into early\n\nhacker culture/reasoning read [The Conscience of a\n\nHacker](https://archive.org/stream/The_Conscience_of_a_Hacker/hackersmanifesto.txt){.link} by The Mentor originally\n\npublished in Phrack Magazine 1986.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Hacker Hats\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Hacker Hats\n:::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/hats.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"hats\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nAn early attempt at classifying hackers involved assigning hat colors according to their motivations. This harkens back\n\nto the old western movies where the bad guys wore black hats and the good guys wore white hats. Just as in real life\n\nnothing is clearly black and white, as such we've laid the traditional roles on a two-axis continuum from malicious to\n\nbenevolent and illegal to legal.\n\n::: description-list\n\n[White Hat]{.term}\n\n:   [These hackers are typically employed by a company to test the security of their systems. They operate legally with\n\n    the intent of ultimately improving security.]{.principal}\n\n[Black Hat]{.term}\n\n:   [These hackers operate outside the bounds of the law, and as such are subject to prosecution. Their intent is\n\n    nefarious usually involving personal profit, malice, or some combination of the two.]{.principal}\n\n[Gray Hat]{.term}\n\n:   [A gray hat hacker operates illegally but ultimately wants to improve the security of the system. They may inform\n\n    administrators of the details of their breach or they may be acting to force a group to better secure their system.\n\n    In rare circumstances a gray hat hacker may actually exploit a system for the purposes of hardening it once they\n\n    have gained administrative access. It should be noted that despite the good intentions, gray hat hackers are still\n\n    operating illegally and may be subject to prosecution.]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThere are several more hat distinctions (blue hats, green hats, etc.) with mixed meanings. For example a blue hat may\n\nrefer to an external entity hired by a company to test the security of a component, as is the case in Microsoft, or it\n\nmay refer to a hacker motivated by revenge. It is also worth nothing that the second quadrant of our graph is empty, but\n\nthis does not mean that there aren't malicious, legal hackers. These may be software developers exploiting legal\n\nloopholes or possibly even individuals working for another government engaged in cyber warfare.\n\n::::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"1.4.

Just as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized access there are also\n\nmany groups of threat actors.\n\nNeophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You\n\nmay hear other pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common thread is that these threat actors\n\nare *not* highly sophisticated. The same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be applied to\n\nautomating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may encounter actors \\\"punching above their weight\\\" or using\n\ncomplex tools while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.\n\nHacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political ends.

In the case of a data breach\n\nonly the hashes are leaked and the attacker does not have access to the passwords to try with other services.\n\nTwo main families of hash algorithms are used: MD5 and SHA. MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value and is still often used to\n\nverify data integrity. The algorithm is technically cryptographically broken, but you may still see it in use.

Typically software is used which generates a hash\n\nfor every word in the dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the compromised machine. One way to\n\ncombat this is through salting or adding random bits to each password. When salting the bits are stored with the hash.\n\nThis forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a\n\nstored table (rainbow table) of all the possible hashes. It can make attacks go from instant to days or even years\n\ndepending on the complexity of the password.\n\nAn even better way of combating attacks against hashes is through a secret salt or *pepper*. A pepper is a random value\n\nthat is added to the password but not stored with the resulting hash.

    "context": "## Case Study: Exploiting Non-Rolling Codes\n::: content\n\nThe importance of non-repeating codes, such as the counter codes used in the CTR and GCM block cipher modes of operation\n\ncan be highlighted through analysis of another important technology that uses codes: keyless entry systems. When garage\n\ndoor openers first came on to the market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was programmed to\n\nrecognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in could easily get the code and replay the code to open the\n\ngarage door with their own device.^\\[[^2]\\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling\n\ncodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code){.link} in their remotes and receivers. Given the same seed a rolling\n\ncode allows each device to generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will use the next code in\n\na sequence every time the button is hit. The receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next\n\nseveral codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times out of range). This effectively mitigates the\n\nreplay attack.\n\nGiven that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes, you would assume car manufacturers employ the\n\nsame technology in their remotes. In a case of \\\"everything old is new again\\\" this isn't true. [Blake Berry\n\n(HackingIntoYourHeart) discovered that several makes and models of cars are actually still vulnerable to a replay\n\nattack.](https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty/blob/main/README.md){.link}\n\nSammy Kamkar also discovered a vulnerablility for rolling codes, named RollJam, which he demonstrated at DEF CON 23.\n\nKamkar's device jams signals sent by a keyfob, while recording the codes being sent. Once it has two codes recorded,\n\npresumably from the victim pressing the button multiple times, it stops jamming, sends out the first code to unlock the\n\ncar and stores the second code to unlock the car at a later time.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n:::::\n\n::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::::\n\n:::::::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"2.10.

Digital Certificates {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__digital_certificates}\nA digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company or an individual. Since asymmetric encryption\n\nrequires know a party's public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of the owner. The question\n\nthen becomes how do you trust that the public key is *actually* for the alleged owner? That's where the issuing\n\nauthority comes in. A *certificate authority (CA)* signs the certificate indicating that the ID and public_key are\n\ncorrect. Certificates can be self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often only used in\n\ntesting. Since most certificates are used for encrypting web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is\n\nusing a self-signed certificate.\n\nGiven how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not\n\nissues by root CAs, but are actually issued by intermediate CAs. Root CAs delegate the work to Intermediate CAs and\n\nindicate their trust in them by signing the intermediate CAs keys. This creates a *chain of trust* from the issued\n\ncertificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA (signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by\n\nthe browser). Tools that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and update them from the companies\n\nthat issue them as needed.\n\nThe certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact with it is often possible to install root CAs\n\nmanually. [This is can be used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for\n\ndebugging](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert){.link} or for more nefarious\n\npurposes.

Lab: Hash it Out {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_hash_it_out}\nA *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique* set of characters for a given *message*. In a\n\nperfect world, given a hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message was, but given a hash and\n\nthe original message you can check that the hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets try\n\nto further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently poor hashing algorithm.^\\[[^3]\\]^\n\n**Anagram Hash**\n\nLet's assume we wanted to hash the message \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" so that we can have a string of characters the uniquely\n\nrepresent that phrase. One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message, make everything lowercase,\n\nand then arrange all the letters alphabetically. \\\"Hello from Karl\\\" becomes \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\". You can think of it like\n\nsaying, \\\"There is one \\'a\\' in the message, one \\'e\\' in the message, one \\'f\\' in the message\\', one \\'k\\' in the\n\nmessage, three \\'l's in the message...\u200b\\\" Now our hash, \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\", can be used to uniquely identify the phrase.\n\nNow assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person sending the message. He could use the untrusted\n\nparty to send us the message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We could use the hash to know the\n\nmessage came from Karl *and* if anyone else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because a hash is\n\na one-way function. \\\"aefhklllmoorr\\\" reveals very little about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.\n\nHopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets examine another very common usecase and find out\n\nexactly why this is a terrible algorithm.\n\nAssume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You want to make sure users are using their password\n\nwhen they log in, but you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite common. If you website was\n\nbreached you don't want to leak a bunch of people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of\n\ntheir password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare the hashes. For example if our password was\n\n\\\"password\\\" using our basic hash algorithm the hash would be \\\"adoprssw\\\". We could store \\\"adoprssw\\\" in our database,\n\nuse it for comparison during login, and if someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know that\n\nthe original password is \\\"password\\\". This may prevent an attacker from exploiting the fact that many people use the\n\nsame password on multiple sites.\n\nThe problem is that there are many things that hash to \\\"adoprssw\\\" including \\\"wordpass\\\", \\\"drowsaps\\\", or even the\n\nhash we're storing: \\\"adoprssw\\\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred to as a *collision* and this\n\nparticular algorithm is useless because it generates so many of them.\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nWhat would the anagram hash of \\\"AlwaysDancing\\\" be?\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\nNow that we understand what hashes do and to some extant how they are possible, lets look at a much more useful hash\n\nfunction.\n\n**MD5**\n\nFor this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.

The term is used to describe many different types of\n\n*intentionally malicious* programs. One of the key differences between malware and just plain bad software is the\n\nintentional aspect of its creation. Malware is designed to damage or exploits computer systems. It often spies on,\n\nspams, or otherwise damages target or host machines.\n\n:::\n\n::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"3.2. Malware Targets\"}\n"

This is due largely to its popularity as\n\na desktop operating system. The second largest target is web browsers, which afford malware a unique cross-platform\n\nreach. The third largest target is the Android mobile operating system, which while technically Linux runs mostly on\n\nmobile phones. Both Linux and Mac do not receive as much malware attention. While this may be partially due to the\n\nopen-source nature of Linux and the BSD kernel used by Macs, it is also partially due to the lack of popularity of each\n\nof these operating systems. Malware is often widely distributed, meaning it can target only the most popular/possibly\n\nweakest links and still be successful.\n\n:::\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Zero Days\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n"

Types of Malware {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__types_of_malware}\nThe definition of malware is so broad and new malware is being created daily. This can make it difficult to classify\n\nmalware. As we go through some basic types, please keep in mind that there is significant overlap. For example, you may\n\nencounter ransomware distributed as a virus *or* ransomware distributed as a trojan.

Worms, Viruses, and Trojans {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__worms_viruses_and_trojans}\nWorms are self-propagating programs that spread without user interaction. Their code is typically stored within an\n\nindependent object, such as a hidden executable file. Worms often do not severely damage their host, as they are\n\nconcerned with rapid, exponential spreading.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nStuxnet\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nStuxnet was a 2010 worm that specifically targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. The worm used an unprecedented four\n\nzero-day attacks and was designed to spread via USB flash drives and Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). In this way it\n\ndidn't just rely on networks to propagate. Ultimately Stuxnet's payload targeted the code used to program PLC devices\n\nthat control motors and make them spin too fast, destroying the centrifuges. Stuxnet also employed an impressive rootkit\n\nto cover its tracks. Given the level of sophistication Stuxnet is believed to have been developed by the US and Israel.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nViruses typically require user interaction, such as copying and infected file from one machine to another, and store\n\ntheir code inside another file on a machine. An executable file may be infected by having the virus code added a\n\nseparate page that executes before the standard program code. Viruses can be quite damaging to the host as they may take\n\nsignificant resources to spread locally. The term virus is also an unfortunately overloaded one. Due to it's popularity\n\nit is often used by some lower-skill threat actors to refer to many different types of malware.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nConcept Virus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nThe Concept virus was the first example of a Microsoft Word macro virus. The virus hid itself inside Microsoft Word\n\nfiles and used Word's embedded macro language to perform its replication tasks. Viruses were later created for Excel and\n\nother programs that had sufficiently sophisticated yet ultimately insecure internal scripting languages.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nA trojan is a form of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software. It does not have to rely on a software\n\nexploit as much as it exploits users into installing, running, or giving extra privileges to the malicious code. Trojans\n\nare the most popular kind of malware as they can be used as an attack vector for many other payloads. The name comes\n\nfrom Greek mythology, where a Trojan horse was disguised as a gift and given to a besieged town. Within the large horse\n\nwere secret troops who came out in the middle of the night and opened the town gates.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nEmotet\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\nEmotet is a banking trojan from 2014 that spread through emails. It made use of malicious links or macro-enabled\n\ndocuments to make the user download its code.

Modern ransomware uses\n\nsymmetric encryption to the files quickly and then encrypts the symmetric key asymmetrically using a hard-coded public\n\nkey for which the threat actor has the corresponding private key. When the ransom is paid, typically via cryptocurrency,\n\nthe threat actor can decrypt the symmetric key using their private key and the user can use the symmetric key to decrypt\n\nthe files.\n\nRansomware is considered a data breach in the data is often exfiltrated as well. It is also worth noting that when the\n\nransom is paid, there is no guarantee that the threat actor will actually begin the decryption process. Typical targets\n\nof ransomware include corporate infrastructure and health care systems although ransomware may also be spread\n\nindeterminately. The payout of ransoms can be a large money-making enterprise so many APTs or criminal groups may employ\n\nits use.

Both of these detection techniques rely on the malware being stored in a file. Fileless malware\n\nattempts to avoid detection by leaving no footprint in the file system. This type of malware uses legitimate processes\n\nto load itself into memory, often with a registry key created to reload every time the machine is restarted.

A protocol may include information about the syntax\n\nused, error correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication occurs in the context of that\n\nsituation. In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses\n\noften determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed\n\nvia individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for\n\nComments (RFCs). You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. [Some of the earliest web\n\nprotocols are detailed in RFCs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616){.link} More often than not, large\n\nprotocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the [Institute of Electrical and\n\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/){.link} which handles WiFi protocols. These groups publish papers\n\ndetailing how the protocols work.\n\nThis chapter will give a brief description of important protocols following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important\n\nto note that some of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks. In this case they will be grouped\n\naccording to which layer they largely function within.\n\n:::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"4.1. Network Access Layer\"}\n"

ARP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__arp}\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used on the local ethernet segment to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. Since\n\nthis protocol functions at the ethernet segment level, security was not a primary concern. Unfortunately this means that\n\nARP communications can be easily spoofed to cause a MitM scenario. A malicious actor simply sends out several ARP\n\npackets, *gratuitous arp*, saying that traffic for a certain IP address should be sent to them. Since the MAC to IP\n\naddress table is cached in several places, it can take a long time for all the caches to invalidate and resolve an issue\n\ncaused by malicious ARP frames.\n\nThere is a protocol designed to mitigate the issues with ARP. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) reaches across layers to work\n\nwith the DHCP lease database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a DHCP lease was granted.\n\nWhile this can solve many of the issues associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure higher-level\n\nprotocols such as HTTPS just in case.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.1.2.

IP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__ip}\nIP stands for internet protocol and it was devised to allow creating a network of networks. The network of networks that\n\nuses it primarily is the Internet, although you could use IP in other scenarios as well. IP is largely concerned with\n\n*routing* traffic across and to networks. The protocol was first detailed by the IEEE in 1974 and comes from the\n\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) project, which created the first large, packet-switched network.\n\nMost people are familiar with IP addresses, the unique number given to a host participating in an IP network. Currently\n\nthere are two main versions of the IP protocol, IPv4 and IPv6, and one of the major differences is in how many IP\n\naddresses are available. IPv4 supports 32 bit addresses and IPv6 supports 128 bit addresses. To give an idea of how big\n\nof a change that is, we have currently allocated all possible IPv4 addresses, but with IPv6 we could give an address to\n\nevery grain of sand on the beaches of earth and still not run out.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"IPv6 Security Implications\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n"

    "context": "## IPv6 Security Implications\n::: content\n\nFrom a security standpoint, the way addresses are used in IPv4 vs IPv6 has big consequences. Since there aren't enough\n\nIPv4 addresses a typical internet user is assigned a local address that gets translated to an external IPv4 address when\n\nthey route their packets through their router. This is referred to as Network Address Translation (NAT) and is usually\n\nhandled by an all-in-one device that also makes sure external entities cannot connect to the internal network.\n\nWith IPv6 addresses each host on that same *internal* network can be given an external IPv6 address. A *basic* IPv6\n\nrouter may simply pass the packets to the network without blocking connections to the internal network. If the machines\n\nare not hardened or a firewall is not put in place/enabled the machines could be subject to attack.\n\nAs a computer security specialist it is important to test not only IPv4 connectivity, but also IPv6 to ensure that your\n\nnetwork is configured appropriately.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.2.2.

ICMP {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__icmp}\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is largely used to send messages between systems when IP doesn't work. For\n\nexample, lets say we tried to connect to a host but our router doesn't know how to get there. Our router can send us an\n\nICMP *Destination Unreachable* message to let us know that something is going wrong. Because ICMP messages work at the\n\nnetwork layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue with the internet layer.\n\nThe most common use for ICMP is the `ping`{.literal} command. `ping`{.literal} sends an ICMP echo request to check to\n\nsee if a host is up. By responding to the request with the data included in the request we can assume that the host is\n\nup and functioning.\n\nICMP is also used in the `traceroute`{.literal} command. `traceroute`{.literal} incrementally increase the Time To Live\n\n(TTL) field of ICMP packets and watches for *TTL Exceeded* messages to determine what route packets are taking to get to\n\na host.

DHCP servers can also give information about proxies,\n\nDomain Name Servers (DNS), gateways and even where to get a [where to get a kernel to boot an OS over the\n\nnetwork!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment){.link}\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of modern networks, with clients coming and going, DHCP is the standard. From a security\n\nstandpoint someone impersonating a DHCP server can wreak havoc on a network. These rogue DHCP servers can cause traffic\n\nto be redirected to initiate MitM attacks or cause DoS attacks. DHCP relies on broadcast Address Resolution Protocol\n\n(ARP) messages and does not make use of authentication, meaning that once an attacker is on the same Ethernet segment as\n\nthe victim machines all bets are off.\n\n:::\n\n::::: {.section .sect3 title=\"4.4.2.

Names are\n\nsignificantly easier for people to remember than IP addresses. In order for a computer to resolve a name, it first\n\nqueries a local cache, then its primary DNS server.

Interception Attacks {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__interception_attacks}\nInterception attacks rely on the ability to intercept network communications. This may be due to the nature of the\n\nnetwork being used or sometimes other methods may leveraged to better position the attacker. These attacks generally\n\ninvolve forging fictitious messages, recording transmitted data, or altering the contents of messages while on a\n\nnetwork. This family of attacks places all parts of the CIA triad at risk.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.1.1. MitM\"}\n"

A typical\n\nattack involves eavesdropping and possibly modifying messages between two parties. Encryption can be used to mitigate\n\nthe attack, making it impossible for an attacker to decrypt the messages they are intercepting. That being said,\n\nparticular attention must be paid to the handshaking/key exchange protocol to be sure that an attacker does not gain\n\naccess to the key(s) being used. What follows is an example of MitM being used to intercept and modify the public key\n\nexchange:\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/mitm-keys.svg\" width=\"500\" alt=\"mitm keys\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nIn the above example the MitM allows the first message to pass unmolested, but tampers with the exchange of the public\n\nkey. By passing it's own public key to Bob, the MitM has to ability to decrypt the messages that Bob sends and can still\n\nuse Alice's public key to re-encrypt the messages at pass them to her. You can see how if two public keys are exchanged\n\nin this manner it would be possible to set up a MitM attack where despite encryption all messages can be seen.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.1.2.

MitB {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mitb}\nMitB stands for man in the browser and is typically caused by a trojan installing malware that allows the attacker to\n\nintercept/modify communications between the browser and the server. This can be used to capture data on forms, modify\n\ninput, or modify the response from the server. Often the software used in MitB attacks lays dormant until the victim\n\nbrowses to a targeted website. What follows is an example of how a MitB attack can be used to modify an online banking\n\nrequest to send money:\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/mitb.svg\" width=\"900\" alt=\"mitb\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nAs you can see the attacker ended up with \\$10,000 and the victim simply thought they authorized a payment of \\$1,000 to\n\nsomeone else.

Replay Attacks {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__replay_attacks}\nThis family of attacks typically involves a MitM making a copy of the transmission and *replaying* it to impersonate the\n\nvictim. Logon credentials, simple hashes, and specific commands are sometimes susceptible to this type of attack. The\n\nsolution is to use timestamps, nonces (random number for that particular session), rotating keys, or a counter to make\n\nsure commands cannot be executed outside of context.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"One-time Passwords\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n"

    "context": "## One-time Passwords\n::: content\n\nTo help mitigate replay attacks, an online banking application may require that client use a one-time password (OTP)\n\nwhen submitting transactions. An OTP is a frequently changing value that is known to both the client and the server.\n\nSeveral one-time password schemes exist, most of which make use of a cryptographic hash function with a shared seed\n\nbetween client and server. Periodically the client and server update to a new hash based on the seed and without the\n\nseed it is impossible to know what the next hash will be. By using an OTP anyone who intercepts the traffic will not be\n\nable to perform a replay attack as the password will not be current.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.1.4.

The attacker gives the victim a bogus certificate authority (CA) certificate which the victim\n\ninstalls. This is often accomplished via a trojan. Then the attacker places themselves in the middle of an uninitiated\n\nsecure connection. During the key exchange the attacker creates a custom certificate signed by a bogus CA for the\n\nconnection between attacker and victim. The attacker also makes an actual HTTPS connection to the service and proxies\n\ndata for the victim. All of the victims data will show up in plaintext for the attacker but the connection will appear\n\nto be secure for the victim. This is used in the [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler){.link} debugging proxy to\n\ndecrypt HTTPS traffic and is also used in some network appliances that perform deep packet inspection.\n\nAnother MitM attack on SSL is simply to maintain or downgrade to an HTTP connection with the victim and proxy data to an\n\nactual HTTPS connection with the server. Most servers will upgrade an insecure connection, but by intercepting that\n\nexchange the attacker can continue to monitor the victim's traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::::::::\n\n::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"5.2.

Virtual networking necessitates the ability to use a different MAC address and\n\nthis feature is built into most modern operating systems. MAC spoofing is when an attacker sets their MAC address to the\n\nMAC address of another machine on the network in an effort to initiate an attack. For example, them may set themselves\n\nup as a gateway to launch a MitM attack.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.2.2. MAC Flooding\"}\n\n\n### 5.2.2. MAC Flooding {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__mac_flooding}\nSwitches are tasked with keeping track of which MAC addresses correspond to which ports on the switch. They use this to\n\nmake sure that traffic is only routed where it needs to go. Given that MAC addresses can be changed, an attacker could\n\nflood a switch with packets from many different MAC addresses and possibly overflow the MAC-port routing table. Some\n\nswitches may default to hub-like functionality and send frames to all ports in an effort to keep traffic flowing. This\n\nthen allows an attacker to capture traffic from other machines on the network.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect3 title=\"5.2.3. ARP Poisoning\"}\n"

Lab: MitM with Scapy {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__lab_mitm_with_scapy}\nIn this lab we will use a fake SSH server, [sshesame](https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame){.link}, and an interactive\n\npacket manipulation program, [scapy](https://scapy.net/){.link}, to disrupt an ongoing SSH session between victim and\n\nserver, position ourself in the middle of the traffic, and capture the username and password victim is using.\n\n:::: table\n\n::: content\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n| Name                                                      | IP Address                                                |\n\n+===========================================================+===========================================================+\n\n| server                                                    | 172.20.0.5                                                |\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n| victim                                                    | 172.20.0.6                                                |\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n| attacker                                                  | 172.20.0.7                                                |\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\n\n: Table 1. IP Addresses Used\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\nFor this lab our IP addresses are configured statically and are known to the attacker. It is also assumed that the\n\nattacker is on the local network. Lastly victim has been poorly configured to ignore changes to the host key. This is\n\nnot entirely unreasonable as many users just ignore the warnings and clear out the known_hosts file when prompted\n\nanyway.\n\nStart by downloading the [scapy.zip](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/scapy.zip){.link} file which\n\ncontains the Docker Compose configuration we will be using. Uncompress it to a directory where you have write access.\n\nThis lab will require us to use three terminal windows/tabs: one for the `docker-compose up`{.literal} command which\n\nwill show the output of everything running in the background, one for the victim which will show an SSH session with the\n\nserver, and one for the attacker which we will use to make the attack.\n\n<figure class=\"image\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/scapy.svg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"scapy\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nOpen three terminals and `cd`{.literal} into the directory where you uncompressed the lab zip file in each of them.\n\nThere should be a `docker-compose.yml`{.literal} file and `server`{.literal}, `victim`{.literal}, and\n\n`attacker`{.literal} directories in the directory you are in.\n\nIn the first terminal run the `docker-compose up`{.literal} command to build the images and run the containers:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>PS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\scapy&gt; docker-compose up\n\nCreating network &quot;scapy_testnet&quot; with the default driver\n\nCreating scapy_server_1   ... done\n\nCreating scapy_victim_1   ... done\n\nCreating scapy_attacker_1 ... done\n\nAttaching to scapy_victim_1, scapy_server_1, scapy_attacker_1\n\nserver_1    | &gt; Starting SSHD\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Generating new host keys\n\nscapy_victim_1 exited with code 0\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 No host keys configured, using keys at &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame&quot;\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_rsa_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_ecdsa_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Host key &quot;/root/.local/share/sshesame/host_ed25519_key&quot; not found, generating it\n\nattacker_1  | INFO 2021/10/07 13:56:45 Listening on [::]:22 \u2460\n\nserver_1    | ssh-keygen: generating new host keys: RSA DSA ECDSA ED25519\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for dsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 1024 MD5:a5:e6:e9:38:d2:2e:88:fd:f0:aa:a8:05:07:35:5f:18 root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | 1024 SHA256:NM7DONpt1doZp4e6WV+6WVVr+KUrh9luUSRcAhnzdyw root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | 1024 SHA512:LHfFdSk1XiAKQArH0CW+RkaKv5GgovPCH7UIQ+P4T2LbgGpCBP5aGA1V3oriYbTZWuS9TlUgDbEfTBq19AV/cA root@a010fe3c2f3c (DSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for rsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 3072 MD5:74:44:b6:a2:74:b9:7e:1b:ba:3d:27:b8:19:3a:48:df root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | 3072 SHA256:mubm9mLNrdNDk5fyj0dghDBIbbwcVKXo23Qdv61/S/c root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | 3072 SHA512:JFQhS6trY7sNqRSwZ+t0uyBb5ddNh9qSLtBrMaa5G7xWzKHpxCuKBSDbvLk4W9JKeQftTU4293UDV9vqCcf/6w root@a010fe3c2f3c (RSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for ecdsa host key\n\nserver_1    | 256 MD5:15:75:5f:9b:72:7c:f0:13:ea:0d:b4:47:b7:62:69:63 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA256:4p/Afp/8C2tHn7AePdS7OHCgPxfBamdaLIUg4IJ7xx4 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA512:NnbevqBXFkGQWIirdFsLPnX85q7q/1Y7E4i+BLHLqE3cg2aqkduBJsssyr9+G7bSvq7txvjl9SRmyRAzuDT7DQ root@a010fe3c2f3c (ECDSA)\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt;&gt; Fingerprints for ed25519 host key\n\nserver_1    | 256 MD5:ad:00:61:26:4d:a0:07:be:6b:8e:91:bd:f0:65:e6:14 root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA256:Vl7jQulDsONglP1xbSN+J8nSfCaIER40rHhgy7z/BYg root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | 256 SHA512:WkmvOWe6oaZ/qE1ZiA0rZAjn9H+hCDxI8NHpsjRNCalK/CgVV9+VhkzHgRTKfKTqQeE0y/Zz2GaEJGv/sapCHg root@a010fe3c2f3c (ED25519)\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: No SSH authorized_keys found!\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Unlocking root account\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: password authentication enabled.\n\nserver_1    | WARNING: password authentication for root user enabled.\n\nserver_1    | &gt;&gt; Running: /etc/entrypoint.d/changepw.sh\n\nserver_1    | Running /usr/sbin/sshd -D -e -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nserver_1    | Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22. \u2461\n\nserver_1    | Server listening on :: port 22.</code></pre>\n\n<figcaption>Listing 1. docker-compose up</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* Notice that attacker has a fake SSH server running in the background\n\n2.  *\u2461* Notice that server has a legitimate SSH server running in the background\n\n:::\n\n<aside class=\"admonition note\" title=\"Note\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nIf you receive the error\n\n`failed to create network scapy_testnet: Error response from daemon: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space`{.literal}\n\ncheck to see if you have other containers running and stop them.

These may be hardware or software\n\ndesigned to help mitigate a security threat. Security solutions may be created in-house, created custom by a third\n\nparty, or outsourced and offered as a service.

False Positives / Negatives {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__false_positives_negatives}\nWhen a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity\n\nof the solution it may utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even artificial intelligence to\n\ntrigger its warning system. In the case of a solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a team\n\nto go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.\n\nThe key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A\n\nsecurity team may spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for abnormalities that correspond to actual\n\nattacks. This information can then be used to build a better detection system.\n\n::::: example\n\n::: example-title\n\nWebroot Antivirus\n\n:::\n\n::: example-content\n\n[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified certain Windows operating system files as\n\nthreats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521){.link}\n\nThe antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for the operation of the machine. The result was a\n\nmachine that was unusable.\n\nFor 13 minutes, Webroot distributed this rule to its antivirus software shutting down operations on an untold number of\n\nmachines. Fortunately Webroot was able to quickly identify the problem and send out an update which would have allowed\n\nthe machines to automatically fix the problem. Unfortunately their infrastructure for distributing the update quickly\n\nbecame overloaded.\n\n:::\n\n:::::\n\nWhen a security solution fails to identify a threat, this is known as a *false negative*. While no solution can ever be\n\n100% effective, false negatives can undermine confidence in a product. False negatives may be resolved by a skilled SOC\n\nteam, closely monitoring what is happening. It is also possible to address false negatives through *Layered Security* a\n\nconcept that we will cover next.\n\n::::::\n\n::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.2. Layered Security\"}\n"

There is often a lot of overlap between solutions and while that may seem inefficient in other fields,\n\nin cybersecurity we consider it a benefit. By using multiple solutions, sometimes referred to as multi-layered security\n\nor defense in depth, you can build a more robust protection against breaches.\n\nLet's take a look at an example to see how layered security can help mitigate the effects of a real-world attack. Assume\n\nan SOC is supporting a web application on self-hosted machines. A malicious actor wishes to exfiltrate data from the web\n\napplication. They begin by testing to see if SQL several different SQL injection attacks yield any results.\n\nA well designed web application should sanitize its inputs and may prevent the queries from making it to the database.\n\nSimilarly an alert team may notice a sudden uptick in SQL queries, far beyond the usual baseline for the application. An\n\nIDS (Intrusion Detection System) may flag the queries as known SQL injection attacks. Assuming the attack makes it past\n\nthe application, team, and the IDS, it is possible that the database user is configured according to the principle of\n\nleast privilege and the queries will not be executed due to a lack of permissions.\n\nAs you can see, any one of these layers may be fail, but by having multiple layers the chance of an attack occurring is\n\ngreatly diminished.\n\n:::\n\n:::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.3.

They are typically marketed as either stand-alone devices,\n\nsoftware to install on internal devices, or a subscription service that routes traffic through an external appliance. In\n\nthe age of cloud computing network security as a service is becoming increasingly popular.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.1. Firewall\"}\n\n\n### 6.3.1. Firewall {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__firewall}\nA firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is\n\na barrier between and private network and the Internet.\n\nSoftware like [nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page){.link} can be used to build a\n\nfirewall on a Linux router for many interior clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as\n\n[Windows Defender\n\nFirewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security){.link}.\n\nFinally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco.\n\nAny combination of these solutions may be used.\n\nFirewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and how to handle them. For example a firewall may\n\nhave a rule to `ALLOW`{.literal} packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH connections.\n\nLikewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to external connection requests and perform network address\n\ntranslation (NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform NAT.\n\nNext-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion\n\nprevention system (IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform these actions as it can easily\n\nclose of connections. NGFW often tout artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat intelligence\n\nupdating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an\n\nIPS](https://www.snort.org/){.link} in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.\n\nNetwork infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nServers that need to be directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they don't have a deal with\n\nrestrictive firewall rules. These servers may be used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to\n\nhandle basic requests such as serving static web pages.\n\nThe largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence\n\nin China. It is a system used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform MitM decryption. The Great\n\nFirewall is made of proxies and firewalls performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often employed\n\nwithin China to circumvent the great firewall and the great firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and\n\nshut down this traffic.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.2.

Proxies and receive and send requests on behalf of a\n\nuser, allowing for full control over the traffic going out and coming back in.\n\nProxies can be used for caching, access control, URL filtering, content scanning, and even packet inspection. Proxy\n\nsolutions may be explicit or transparent and are offered by many companies including McAfee, Fortigate, Netsparker, and\n\nPalo Alto. A typical application of a proxy would be to filter explicit content on a school district network.\n\nProxies can also be broken into *forward* and *reverse* configurations. A forward proxy passes requests from a private\n\nor internal network to the internet. Forward proxies can speed up local requests through caching and validate that the\n\nrequest should be performed. Forward proxies are interoperable with standard firewalls and network address translation\n\n(NAT).\n\nReverse proxies take requests from an external source and pass it to an internal service. This helps prevent clients\n\nfrom having direct access to internal services. Reverse proxies can utilize caching and validate requests as well. A\n\nreverse proxy can also be configured to work with a firewall. Whereas it used to be common practice to place a server in\n\na demilitarized zone (DMZ) outside of a firewall, it is now far more common to employ a reverse proxy to reach that\n\nserver.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"6.3.3.

Load balancers distribute work, in\n\nthe form of external client requests, among the internal resources, typically servers.\n\nFor example, if a company has four servers supporting a web application, they may employ a reverse proxy load balancer\n\nthat takes requests from clients and passes that request to one of the four internal servers. Different metrics are used\n\nto determine how the servers are utilized including least used (round robin), weighted, least amount of active\n\nconnections.

VPNs\n\nhave become standard procedure for linking remote offices or connecting remote workers. Given the growth of working from\n\nhome, almost all users have become familiar with what a VPN is and what it does.\n\nSite-to-site VPNs are typically used for linking offices together. This kind of VPN is on permanently. An example would\n\nbe linking two college campuses: NJIT Newark and NJIT Jersey City. In this scenario users on either campus expect to be\n\nable to connect securely to services on the opposite campus at all times. The traffic is encrypted and carried over the\n\nInternet.\n\nRemote access VPNs are used by individuals connecting in to a secure network. This kind of VPN is usually stated through\n\na application such as Cisco AnyConnect. When the application is running the user is able to securely access internal\n\nresources as if they were at the office.\n\nMany vendors offer VPN products including Cisco, Citrix, Fortinet, Palo Alto, and Checkpoint.

Email Solutions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__email_solutions}\nThe original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM\n\nand phishing emails are unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that scan for viruses or use\n\npatterns to identify phishing emails. Many of these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts Exchange.\n\nAnother large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently three common methods exist: Sender Policy\n\nFramework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance\n\n(DMARC).\n\nSPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender. When inbound mail is received, the SPF\n\ninformation for the domain of the sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's SPF record\n\ncurrently looks like this:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nIt is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf\n\nlike mass mailers, web applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker from impersonating emails\n\nfrom a domain.\n\nDKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an email originated from a particular SMTP server.\n\nPublic keys for a domain are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private keys are used by the\n\nSMTP server for that domain to sign the emails being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message\n\noriginated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can also be distributed to SMTP servers that send\n\nemails on behalf of the domain.\n\nDMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers questions like, \\\"What should I do if a message is\n\nfrom a valid SPF IP but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\\\" or \\\"What should I do with a message that looks like SPAM\n\nbut has a valid DKIM signature?\\\" DMARC puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered approach to\n\ndetermine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.section .sect2 title=\"6.8.

This\n\nprinciple reduces an attack surface and helps stop the spread of malware as a single compromised account will not have\n\naccess to all of the resources.\n\nLeast privilege is also an important concept for compliance purposes. For example, laws may require and audit of all\n\naccounts that have Internet access.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__multi_factor_authentication_mfa}\nMulti-factor authentication is a technique that requires actors to provide two or more pieces of information to be used\n\nas identification. Some examples of identification would be usernames and passwords, token codes, a physical token, or\n\nbiometric data. Typically it is suggested to use \\\"something you have and something you know\\\" for example the code in\n\nan SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password (you know your password).\n\nThere are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the time based creation of a code.

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects\n\n(files, directories, devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access it and how. This is a\n\nparticularly stringent form of access control which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but\n\nresults in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC) simplifies things by allowing owners of objects\n\nto determine which permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers great flexibility and ease of\n\nimplementation, but can result in a less secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based Access\n\nControl (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within a system to determine who has different levels of\n\naccess to objects. RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to implement DAC or MAC.\n\nAttribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead\n\nof just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to objects based on the attributes of the object,\n\nthe user, the action, or even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any way that can be codified\n\ninto a rule.

A key card uses the same form factor as a credit card,\n\nmaking it easy for employees to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic stripes or chips\n\n(in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).\n\nBasic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique\n\nnumber stored on the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas where key cards are being used\n\nto make sure additional hardware is not installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to educate\n\nusers of the system so they do not share their key cards with others and report them if they go missing.\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar titled\" title=\"Proximity Cards\" epub:type=\"sidebar\">\n\n\n## Proximity Cards\n::: content\n\n<figure class=\"image right\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/rfid.svg\" alt=\"rfid\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is\n\na *passive* electronic device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of power for its circuit.\n\nThis has the advantage of not requiring a battery only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like\n\nnear the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox\n\ncard has a long antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be resonant at 125 kHz and when\n\npowered by the field created by the reader it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then broadcasts\n\nthe card's ID.\n\nUnfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very simple operations due to the need for low power\n\nconsumption. All a proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An attacker can listen for that\n\nnumber by placing another reader next to the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will activate the\n\ncard when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26 bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card\n\nwith that same number and gain access.\n\nThere have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using\n\nAES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf){.link}. It is also possible to require another factor\n\nof identification in addition to the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone applications via NFC\n\nwhich have significantly more processing power to support trustless cryptographic identification.\n\n:::\n\n</aside>\n\n::::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.2.4.

Active Directory {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__active_directory}\nActive Directory (AD) is a directory service typically used in Windows networks to control and track resources. AD is a\n\nMicrosoft technology that enables centralized network management. It has proven to be very scalable and is commonly\n\ndeployed in the enterprise environment (corporations, universities, schools, etc.)\n\nActive Directory relies upon the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for its communications. While AD is\n\nprobably the largest deployed user of LDAP other implementations for various operating systems exist, including Apple\n\nOpenDirectory, RH Directory Server, and OpenLDAP. LDAP is often used by internal applications and process.\n\nThe cornerstone of an AD environment is the Domain Controller (DC). DCs stores directory information about Users,\n\nGroups, Computers, Policies, and more. They respond to auth requests for the domain (network) they are supporting. A\n\nstandard network will have multiple DCs with fail-over in place in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor many environments, AD is the mechanism used for authentication, authorization, and accounting. As many services have\n\nmigrated to the web, the need to access AD from anywhere has become increasingly important. This has kindled the growth\n\nof Azure Active Directory, a cloud-based version of active directory. Increasingly we are seeing deployments that\n\nutilize cloud-based resources instead of local DCs.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.2. Privileged Identity Management (PIM)\"}\n"

Unix File Permissions {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__unix_file_permissions}\nFrom its inception, Unix was designed to be a multi-user environment, and as such, a lot of attention was paid to file\n\npermissions. Every file in a Unix system has an owner and a group. Each file also has permissions for owner, group, and\n\nall users. Permissions are set using octal numbers where each bit represents read (bit 0: 1), write (bit 1: 2), or\n\nexecute (bit 2: 4) permission.\n\n<figure class=\"image left\">\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n\n<img src=\"images/permissions.svg\" alt=\"permissions\" />\n\n</div>\n\n</figure>\n\nFor example, if you wanted a read and execute permission the number would be 5 (1 + 4). Read and write permission would\n\nbe 3 (1 + 2).\n\nPermissions are specified with the `chmod`{.literal} command, the first octal number is the permissions for the owner,\n\nthe second is for the group, and the third is for all user. So to change a file to have read, write, and execute\n\npermissions for the owner, read permissions for the group, and no permissions for everyone else, the command would be\n\n`chmod 710 <filename>`{.literal} where `<filename>`{.literal} is the name of your file.\n\nThe owner and group of a file can be set with the `chown`{.literal} command:\n\n`chown <owner>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. If `<group>`{.literal} is not specified only the owner is changed.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"7.3.6. ACLs\"}\n"

Most severs support RSA,\n\nDSA, and ECDSA keys, with RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized keys, typically in\n\n`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{.literal}, that can be used to connect to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server\n\nissues a challenge asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private key. If the private key matches\n\nthe public key stored in the `authorized_keys`{.literal} file, the user is logged in.\n\nSSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't need to remember and type in a password. For this\n\nreason, keys are often used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a\n\n[git](https://git-scm.com/){.link}. Keys also have the advantage of possibly thwarting MitM attacks. While a password\n\ncan be easily stolen by a malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will only transmit a\n\nsigned bit of random data.

Single Sign On (SSO) {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__single_sign_on_sso}\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate usernames and passwords can be difficult for\n\nusers. A recent trend has been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to confirm that users are\n\nwho they claim to be. There are a few protocols that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow\n\ncenters around the SAML identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access to a resource via SAML:\n\n::: {.ordered-list .arabic}\n\n1.  [User accesses a sevice]{.principal}\n\n2.  [User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request]{.principal}\n\n3.  [User logs in]{.principal}\n\n4.  [Credentials are verified]{.principal}\n\n5.  [SAML IDP sends credentials to the service]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nOpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a third-party identity provider in a similar fashion\n\nto SAML. One of the main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized, allowing for multiple IDPs for\n\nusers to choose from. In February 2014 OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that allows IDPs to\n\nprovide information about users via a REST API. This move was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.\n\nOAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not\n\n*technically* a full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of one.

Read, write, and execute permissions for a\n\nfile can be set for the user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the `ls -l`{.literal}\n\ncommand. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol and view the default permissions:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThe text `drwxr-xr-x`{.literal} tells us that these files are directories, the owner has read/write/execute permission,\n\nthe group has read/execute permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is important to note that\n\nexecute permissions are required for viewing the contents of a directory.\n\nFiles owners and a groups are set with the `chown`{.literal} command, following the format\n\n`chown <user>.<group> <filename>`{.literal}. Let's try to use this command to make the home directories of alice, bob,\n\nand carol private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nWhen a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd`{.literal} command a group with their name is created. This\n\nallows us to pass a group to `chown`{.literal} that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others\n\nstill have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning *anyone* can view the contents. To prove this,\n\nlets assume the role of dave and try doing an `ls`{.literal} on each of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave \u2460\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ ls bob\n\n$ ls carol\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\n::: callout-list\n\n1.  *\u2460* `su`{.literal} allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*\n\n:::\n\nThe `ls`{.literal} command was successful even though there were no files to look at. If we weren't able to view the\n\ncontents, we would have received a permission denied error. The `chmod`{.literal} command is used to modify file\n\npermissions for a User (`u`{.literal}), Group (`g`{.literal}), Others (`o`{.literal}), or All (`a`{.literal}).\n\n`chmod`{.literal} can remove a permission with `-`{.literal}, add a permission with `+`{.literal}, or set a permission\n\n(removing others) with `=`{.literal}. Let's use `chmod`{.literal} to actually make these home directories private:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice\n\ndrwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nThings look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any of the directories:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave\n\n$ ls alice\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;alice&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls bob\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;bob&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ ls carol\n\nls: cannot open directory &#39;carol&#39;: Permission denied\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home directory:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice\n\n$ ls alice\n\n$ exit</code></pre>\n\n</figure>\n\nLooks good!\n\n<aside class=\"admonition important deliverable\" title=\"Important\" epub:type=\"notice\">\n\n::: content\n\nUsing your first name (all lowercase) add yourself as a user and create a home directory for yourself.

For\n\nexample, lets assume that we wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and Carol's home\n\ndirectories. This is typically done to allow users to place a `public_html`{.literal} directory in their home directory\n\nand set up a personal web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by others, but then we have\n\nthe same issue we started with. We could also do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a\n\ngroup that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home directories to any other users or services that are\n\npart of that group.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to fine tune permissions. Two commands,\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} and `getfacl`{.literal} are used to adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the\n\n`setfacl`{.literal} command to explicitly give the http user read and execute permissions to all three directories, list\n\nthe new permissions, and list the new ACLs:\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# useradd http\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# setfacl -m u:http:rx alice bob carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l\n\ntotal 12\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice \u2460\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob\n\ndrwxr-x---+ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol\n\nroot@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# getfacl alice bob carol\n"

This may involve looking at the crime rate of the area,\n\ndetermining the value of the items in the house, taking into account how difficult it would be to lock the door, and\n\ndetermining whether you want to lock the door and/or purchase an alarm system. An asset would be the things in the\n\nhouse, like a laptop of example. Risk would be the impact or a robbery, perhaps \\$800 for the lost laptop. Finally\n\ncontrols/countermeasures would be locking the door, getting a camera system, and/or and alarm system.\n\n:::::::: {.section .sect2 title=\"8.1. Vulnerability Management\"}\n"

    "context": "## 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_computer_systems_security_planning_for_success.xhtml__vulnerability_management}\nThe first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The security team needs to collect:\n\n::: itemized-list\n\n- [Hardware information including the operating systems being used and type of device (laptop, server, IoT,\n\n  etc.)]{.principal}\n\n- [Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and details about the network segment]{.principal}\n\n- [Domain information including domain name and workgroup]{.principal}\n\n- [Information about applications used and their approval status]{.principal}\n\n- [Information from security tools currently running on the device]{.principal}\n\n- [Owner information for the device]{.principal}\n\n:::\n\nThis information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a significant portion of it typically is. This\n\nstep is part of inventory management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset information. Using endpoint\n\nagents, network monitoring (often via simple network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory\n\nmanagement system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in, the operating system being used, the\n\napplications installed and their install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory management is\n\nrequired for good vulnerability management.\n\nScans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can be run internally and externally either under a\n\nprivileged or unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network segment at times when they will be\n\nleast intrusive. These scans will generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if any\n\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\nScripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP,\n\nTCP/UDP, or HTTP checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For example, if we have an internal web\n\nserver that has had a directory traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform GET requests for\n\nvulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed. This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability\n\nmanagement.\n\n::: {.section .sect3 title=\"8.1.1. CVEs\"}\n"

By isolating the infected asset, we can help prevent this.\n\nThere are a few other tools for containing malware such as sandboxing and snapshots. Sandboxing refers to the practice\n\nof running processes in a controlled environment on a machine. Most web browsers sandbox the JavaScript they run,\n\nmeaning that if a website is serving malicious JS it should not be able to affect anything else on the machine.\n\nSnapshots refer to periodically saving the state of the storage device on a machine.

If it is possible to remove malware\n\nfrom a machine, that action is taken in this step. Breached accounts are also disabled.\n\nUnfortunately it may be impossible to roll back some assets to a previously uncompromised state, in which case they may\n\nneed to be restored from a backup or failing that rebuilt from the ground up. Backups make recovery much simpler and\n\ncompanies that do not have a backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That being said, malware\n\nmay have also found its way into the backups if given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically\n\ndestroyed and a new one is built.

Download [the malicious.zip\n\nfile](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/malicious.zip){.link}, unzip it in a directory where you have write\n\naccess, and navigate to that directory in your shell.\n\n<figure class=\"listing\">\n\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>PS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\malicious&gt; docker build -t malicious . \u2460\n\n[+] Building 32.4s (8/8) FINISHED\n\n =&gt; [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                                                                                                                                                        0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring dockerfile: 134B                                                                                                                                                                        0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load .dockerignore                                                                                                                                                                           0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring context: 2B                                                                                                                                                                             0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/php:apache                                                                                                                                              32.2s\n\n =&gt; [1/3] FROM docker.io/library/php:apache@sha256:f1c5dba2a2981f91ec31b9596d4165acd0b46e58382e47622487e130a21e420d                                                                                         0.0s\n\n =&gt; [internal] load build context                                                                                                                                                                           0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; transferring context: 61B                                                                                                                                                                            0.0s\n\n =&gt; CACHED [2/3] COPY shell.php /var/www/html/shell.php                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; CACHED [3/3] COPY index.php /var/www/html/index.php                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; exporting to image                                                                                                                                                                                      0.1s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; exporting layers                                                                                                                                                                                     0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; writing image sha256:e1dc75a91b2e269091069b1e3406a496b4bbfd95b066f970062ea8b3a74d8368                                                                                                                0.0s\n\n =&gt; =&gt; naming to docker.io/library/malicious                                                                                                                                                                0.0s\n\nPS C:\\Users\\rxt1077\\it230\\labs\\malicious&gt; docker run -p 8080:80 malicious \u2461\n\nAH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server&#39;s fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.2.
