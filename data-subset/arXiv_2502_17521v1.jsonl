(2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024); Wan et\u00a0al. (2023). Trained on vast amounts of Internet-sourced data, these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, including code generation, text summarization, and mathematical reasoning\u00a0Codeforces (2025); Hu et\u00a0al. (2024).\n\nTo develop and enhance LLMs, beyond advancements in model architectures and training algorithms, a crucial area of research focuses on effectively evaluating their intelligence. Traditionally, LLM evaluation has relied on static benchmarking, which involves using carefully curated human-crafted datasets and assessing model performance with appropriate metrics\u00a0Wang (2018); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Gunasekar et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\nFor example, in 2021, OpenAI introduced the HumanEval\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) dataset to benchmark the code generation capabilities of LLMs; HumanEval has since become a widely used standard for this purpose.\n\nHowever, because these static benchmarks are released on the Internet for transparent evaluation, and LLMs gather as much data as possible from the Internet for training, potential data contamination is unavoidable\u00a0Magar and Schwartz (2022); Deng et\u00a0al. (2024b); Li et\u00a0al. (2024d); Sainz et\u00a0al. (2024); Balloccu et\u00a0al. (2024). Data contamination occurs when benchmark data is inadvertently included in the training phase of language models, leading to an inflated and misleading assessment of their performance. While this issue has been recognized for some time\u2014stemming from the fundamental machine learning principle of separating training and test sets\u2014it has become even more critical with the advent of LLMs. These models often scrape vast amounts of publicly available data from the Internet, significantly increasing the likelihood of contamination\u00a0Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2024). Furthermore, due to privacy and commercial concerns, tracing the exact training data for these models is challenging, if not impossible, complicating efforts to detect and mitigate potential contamination.\n\nFigure 1: The progress of benchmarking LLM\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available. Please use `PdfPipelineOptions(generate_picture_images=True)` -->\n\nTo mitigate the risk of data contamination in LLM benchmarking, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance static approaches, such as data encryption\u00a0Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) and post-hoc contamination detection Shi et\u00a0al. (2024). However, due to the inherent limitations of static methods, researchers have introduced new dynamic benchmarking schema (Fig.\u00a01 illustrates the evolution from static to dynamic benchmarking).\n\nOne of the dynamic benchmarking methods involves continuously updating benchmark datasets based on the timestamps of LLM training to minimize contamination\u00a0White et\u00a0al. (2024); Jain et\u00a0al. (2024). Another method focuses on regenerating benchmark data to reconstruct original benchmarks\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2024); Zhou et\u00a0al. (2025); Mirzadeh et\u00a0al. (2025), thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.\n\nDespite the numerous approaches proposed for transparent LLM benchmarking, no systematic survey has summarized the rapid progress of dynamic benchmarking methods. Existing literature reviews primarily focus on post-hoc detection of data contamination and do not address emerging dynamic benchmarking strategies\u00a0Deng et\u00a0al. (2024a); Ravaut et\u00a0al. (2024). Moreover, no existing work discusses criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks themselves. Additionally, these reviews often lack a comprehensive discussion of the strengths and limitations of each method.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic survey of benchmarking methods for LLMs designed to mitigate the risk of data contamination, covering both static and dynamic benchmarks. We summarize state-of-the-art methods and provide an in-depth discussion of their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we are the first to propose a set of criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Our study reveals that existing dynamic benchmarks do not fully satisfy these proposed criteria, implying the imperfection of current design. We hope that our criteria will provide valuable insights for the future design and standardization of dynamic benchmarking methods.\n\nFigure 2:  Taxonomy of research on benchmarking LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

We begin with an overview of data contamination (\u00a72), establishing the necessary background. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of static benchmarking methods and examine how existing research has improved them to mitigate potential data contamination (\u00a73). We then outline key criteria for an effective dynamic benchmark and introduce existing dynamic benchmarking approaches (\u00a74). Finally, in \u00a75, we reflect on insights from prior work, summarize current challenges, and explore future research directions.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Data Contamination in LLMs\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

    "context": "###### Examples of each contamination\nWe provide contamination examples in Table\u00a01. In the case of syntactic contamination, the test data is derived from the training data by rephrasing it with the addition of a prefix string. There is ongoing debate about whether such syntactic transformations constitute true data contamination, as it is challenging to distinguish between an LLM\u2019s ability to recall memorized information and its reasoning capability during inference. In this work, we consider such syntactic transformations as contamination, given that some NLP applications rely primarily on syntactic information for decision-making.\n\n\n###### Significance of contamination\nUnderstanding and mitigating potential data contamination in benchmarking LLMs is significant, especially given the rapid pace of LLM development. Without a robust approach to identifying and preventing contamination, evaluations may overestimate a model\u2019s true capabilities by inadvertently testing it on data it has already seen. This undermines the validity of benchmarks, making it difficult to assess generalization, robustness, and real-world applicability. Contaminated benchmarks can lead to misleading conclusions about progress in LLM research, influencing model comparisons, deployment decisions, and policy-making. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring that benchmarks provide an accurate and reliable measure of an LLM\u2019s true ability to handle novel and unseen data.\n"

    "context": "#### 2.2 Contamination from LLM Training\nUnlike traditional models with clear separations between training and evaluation data, LLMs are pre-trained on massive, diverse datasets\u2014often scraped from the web (e.g., FineWeb\u00a0Penedo et\u00a0al. (2024))\u2014which increases the risk of evaluation data overlap. In the post-training phase, models are further fine-tuned on large human-annotated\u00a0Mukherjee et\u00a0al. (2023); Kim et\u00a0al. (2023) or synthetic datasets\u00a0Ding et\u00a0al. (2023); Teknium (2023); Wang et\u00a0al. (2023) that may resemble evaluation tasks, further compounding contamination risks. Although retrieval-based detection methods\u00a0Team et\u00a0al. (2024); Achiam et\u00a0al. (2023) exist, the sheer scale and complexity of training corpora make it difficult to entirely exclude evaluation data. Additionally, many LLMs keep their training data proprietary\u00a0Dubey et\u00a0al. (2024); Yang et\u00a0al. (2024), complicating the accurate assessment of their true performance and highlighting the need for fair and reliable benchmarks. This opacity further exacerbates data contamination, as it impedes the community\u2019s ability to verify and mitigate potential overlaps between training and evaluation data.\n"

For example, instruction-following tasks evaluate a model\u2019s ability to interpret and execute commands\u00a0(Zhou et\u00a0al., 2023; Qin et\u00a0al., 2024; Huang et\u00a0al., 2024), while coding tasks assess its capability to generate and understand programming code\u00a0(Chen et\u00a0al., 2021; Austin et\u00a0al., 2021; Jimenez et\u00a0al., 2024; Codeforces, 2025; Aider, 2025).\n\nDespite their usefulness, static benchmarks face challenges as LLMs evolve rapidly and continue training on all available data\u00a0(Villalobos et\u00a0al., 2022). Over time, unchanging benchmarks may become too easy for stronger LLMs or introduce data contamination issues.\n\nRecognizing this critical problem, contamination detectors have been developed to quantify contamination risks, and dynamic benchmarks have been proposed to mitigate these issues.\n\nTable 2: Summary of benchmarking applications.\n\n<!-- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f\u274c Image not available.

To address this issue, several methods have been proposed to enhance static benchmarking and mitigate the impact of data contamination.\n\n\n##### 3.3.1 Canary String\nCanary strings are deliberately crafted, unique tokens embedded within a dataset to serve as markers for data contamination. When a model\u2019s output unexpectedly includes these tokens, it strongly indicates that the model has memorized portions of its training data rather than learning to generalize. For instance, the BIG-Bench dataset incorporates these strings so that model developers can identify and filter out such instances Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n\n###### Limitations\nThe effectiveness of canary strings depends on model trainers being aware of and responsive to these markers.\n\nIf a developer aims to leak benchmarking data to boost scores, this method will not work.\n"

    "context": "##### 3.3.2 Encryption\nEncryption methods secure evaluation data by making it inaccessible to unauthorized parties, preventing its accidental inclusion in training sets. Jacovi et\u00a0al. (2023) propose encrypting test data with a public key and a \u201cNo Derivatives\u201d license to block automated crawling and reuse. Yang et\u00a0al. (2023) show that even advanced decontamination methods can be defeated by minor text variations, emphasizing the need for robust encryption. Similarly, TRUCE (Chandran et\u00a0al., 2024) leverages confidential computing and secure multi-party computation to enable private benchmarking, ensuring that test data and model parameters remain confidential.\n\n\n###### Limitation\nWhile these methods effectively protect against data leakage, they depend on strong key management, they introduce extra computational overheads. These methods are vulnerable if encryption is compromised or private key is exposed.\n\n\n##### 3.3.3 Label Protection\nLabel protection involves keeping the true answers of a test set hidden from public access so that only an authorized evaluator can use them during model assessment. This approach is common in benchmarks such as GLUE Wang (2018), SuperGLUE Wang et\u00a0al. (2019), and OpenAI\u2019s HumanEval Chen et\u00a0al. (2021), etc., where the test labels are withheld to prevent models from learning or memorizing them during training.

If the correctness of the generated dataset cannot be guaranteed, the benchmark may provide a false sense of reliability when applied to benchmarking LLMs, leading to misleading evaluations.\n\nWe quantify the correctness of dynamic benchmarks as:\n\nwhere \ud835\udcb3isubscript\ud835\udcb3\ud835\udc56\\mathcal{X}\\_{i}caligraphic\\_X start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and \ud835\udcb4isubscript\ud835\udcb4\ud835\udc56\\mathcal{Y}\\_{i}caligraphic\\_Y start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT represent the input and output of the it\u2062hsuperscript\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210ei^{th}italic\\_i start\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\\_t italic\\_h end\\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT transformation, respectively.

For example, the function \ud835\udca2\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udca2\u22c5\\mathcal{G}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_G ( \u22c5 ) could be a domain-specific an annotator.\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the expected alignment between the transformed dataset\u2019s outputs and their corresponding ground truth values, measured using the scoring function \ud835\udcae\u2062(\u22c5)\ud835\udcae\u22c5\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)caligraphic\\_S ( \u22c5 ). A higher correctness score indicates that the dynamic benchmark maintains correctness to the ground truth.\n"

A smaller dataset can introduce more statistical errors during the benchmarking process. Therefore, an optimal dynamic benchmark should generate a larger dataset while minimizing associated costs. The scalability of a dynamic benchmark is quantified as:\n\nThis represents the expectation over the entire transformation space, where \u2225Ti\u2062(\ud835\udc9f)\u2225delimited-\u2225\u2225subscript\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc9f\\lVert T\\_{i}(\\mathcal{D})\\rVert\u2225 italic\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( caligraphic\\_D ) \u2225 is the size of the transformed dataset, and \u2225\ud835\udc9f\u2225delimited-\u2225\u2225\ud835\udc9f\\lVert\\mathcal{D}\\rVert\u2225 caligraphic\\_D \u2225 is the size of the original dataset.

    "context": "##### 4.2.3 Collision\nOne of the main motivations for dynamic benchmarking is to address the challenge of balancing transparent benchmarking with the risk of data contamination. Since the benchmarking algorithm is publicly available, an important concern arises: If these benchmarks are used to train LLM, can they still reliably reflect the true capabilities of LLMs?\n\nTo evaluate the robustness of a dynamic benchmark against this challenge, we introduce the concept of collision in dynamic benchmarking. Collision refers to the extent to which different transformations of the benchmark dataset produce overlapping data, potentially limiting the benchmark\u2019s ability to generate novel and diverse test cases. To quantify this, we propose the following metrics:\n\nCollision Rate measures the percentage of overlap between two independently transformed versions of the benchmark dataset, indicating how much poential contamination among two trials. Repeat Trials quantifies the expected number of transformation trials required to fully regenerate an existing transformed dataset Ti\u2062(\ud835\udc9f)subscript\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc9fT\\_{i}(\\mathcal{D})italic\\_T start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_i end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( caligraphic\\_D ), providing insight into the benchmark\u2019s ability to produce novel variations.\n\nThese metrics help assess whether a dynamic benchmark remains effective in evaluating LLM capabilities, even when exposed to potential training data contamination.\n"

    "context": "##### 4.2.4 Stable of Complexity\nDynamic benchmarks must also account for complexity to help users determine whether a performance drop in an LLM on the transformed dataset is due to potential data contamination or an increase in task complexity. If a dynamic transformation increases the complexity of the seed dataset, a performance drop is expected, even without data contamination. However, accurately measuring the complexity of a benchmark dataset remains a challenging task. Existing work has proposed various complexity metrics, but these are often domain-specific and do not generalize well across different applications. For example, DyVal\u00a0(Zhu et\u00a0al., 2024a) proposes applying graph complexity to evaluate the complexity of reasoning problems.\n\nFormally, given a complexity measurement function \u03a8\u2062(\u22c5)\u03a8\u22c5\\Psi(\\cdot)roman\\_\u03a8 ( \u22c5 ), the stability can be formulated as:\n\nThis equation can be interpreted as the variance in complexity across different trials, where high variance indicates that the dynamic benchmarking method is not stable.\n"

Rule-based or manually crafted transformations are inherently interpretable, while LLM-assisted transformations depend on the model\u2019s transparency and traceability. In such cases, additional mechanisms like explainability tools, or human-in-the-loop validation may be needed to ensure reliability and correctness.\n\n\n#### 4.3 Existing Work\nBuilding on the task formats of static benchmarks, dynamic benchmarks have been introduced to assess LLM capabilities while minimizing data contamination and ensuring fairness.\n\nTable\u00a02 summarizes recent dynamic benchmarks for LLM evaluation.\n\nDynamic benchmarks can be categorized into four types based on their construction process: temporal cutoff, rule-based generation, LLM-based generation, and hybrid approaches.\n\nTemporal cutoff follows a data collection process similar to static benchmarks, with the key difference being that data is gathered from newly released information.\n\nRule-based and LLM-based generation approaches create novel evaluation data points using predefined rules or by leveraging the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.\n\nFinally, hybrid approaches combine the idea of these different approaches.\n"

Data privacy and commercial concerns further complicate contamination issues.\n\nSecond, traditional static methods fall short in preventing contamination, prompting the creation of dynamic benchmarks. However, our study identifies a lack of standardized criteria for evaluating these dynamic benchmarks. We hope our proposed criteria will offer valuable insights and guide the development of more effective benchmarks.\n\nCurrent Challenges.\n\nStatic benchmarking methods face challenges due to a lack of transparency (e.g., label protection) and high assumptions about contaminated models (e.g., post-hoc detection). Although dynamic benchmarks address these limitations, they introduce new issues, such as balancing correctness with scalability. We also observed that some dynamic benchmarks neglect complexity control, resulting in inefficiencies in evaluation.\n\nFuture Directions.\n\nDynamic benchmarking offers a new approach for evaluating LLMs, but our study reveals a lack of standardized criteria. Future efforts should focus on standardizing these criteria for dynamic benchmarks.\n"

We find that static methods, though consistent, become more vulnerable to contamination as training datasets grow. While dynamic approaches show promise, they face challenges in reliability and reproducibility. Future research should focus on standardized dynamic evaluation, and practical mitigation tools.\n\n\n### Limitations\nWhile this survey provides a comprehensive overview of static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs, there are several limitations to consider. First, due to the rapidly evolving nature of LLM development and benchmarking techniques, some recent methods or tools may not have been fully covered. As benchmarking practices are still emerging, the methods discussed may not yet account for all potential challenges or innovations in the field. Additionally, our proposed criteria for dynamic benchmarking are a first step and may need further refinement and validation in real-world applications. Lastly, this survey focuses primarily on high-level concepts and may not delve into all the fine-grained technical details of specific methods, which may limit its applicability to practitioners seeking in-depth implementation guidelines.\n"

    "context": "### Ethical Considerations\nOur work is rooted in the goal of enhancing the transparency and fairness of LLM evaluations, which can help mitigate the risks of bias and contamination in AI systems. However, ethical concerns arise when considering the use of both static and dynamic benchmarks. Static benchmarks, if not carefully constructed, can inadvertently perpetuate biases, especially if they rely on outdated or biased data sources. Dynamic benchmarks, while offering a more adaptive approach, raise privacy and security concerns regarding the continual collection and updating of data. Moreover, transparency and the potential for misuse of benchmarking results, such as artificially inflating model performance or selecting biased evaluation criteria, must be carefully managed. It is essential that benchmarking frameworks are designed with fairness, accountability, and privacy in mind, ensuring they do not inadvertently harm or disadvantage certain user groups or research domains. Lastly, we encourage further exploration of ethical guidelines surrounding data usage, model transparency, and the broader societal impact of AI benchmarks.\n"
