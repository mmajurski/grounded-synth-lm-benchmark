It was released on October 22, 2012, by Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her third studio album, \"Speak Now\".  The album title was inspired by the \"semi-toxic relationships\" that Swift experienced during the process of conceiving this album, which Swift described the emotions she felt as \"red emotions\" due to their intense and tumultuous nature.  \"Red\" touches on Swift's signature themes of love and heartbreak, however, from a more mature perspective while exploring other themes such as fame and the pressure of being in the limelight.  The album features collaborations with producers and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol and Ed Sheeran and is noted for Swift's experimentation with new musical genres.  Swift completed The Red Tour in support of the album on June 12, 2014, which became the highest-grossing tour of all time by a country artist, grossing over $150 million.",

[PAR] [TLE] Man Down (song) [SEP] \"Man Down\" is a song by Barbadian singer Rihanna from her fifth studio album, \"Loud\" (2010).  Singer Shontelle and production duo Rock City wrote the song with its main producer, Sham.  They wrote it during a writing camp, in Los Angeles of March 2010, held by Rihanna's record label to gather compositions for possible inclusion on the then-untitled album.  Rock City were inspired by Bob Marley's 1973 song \"I Shot the Sheriff\" and set out to create a song which embodied the same feel, but from a female perspective.  \"Man Down\" is a reggae murder ballad which incorporates elements of ragga and electronic music.  Lyrically, Rihanna is a fugitive after she shoots a man, an action she later regrets.  Several critics singled out \"Man Down\" as \"Loud\"' s highlight, while others commented on her prominent West Indian accent and vocal agility.",

The piece involves the manipulation of electric metronomes, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions.  It is a very theatrical piece, and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with Fluxus, an experimental art movement from the sixties.  The only true scored \"instrument\" is an electric metronome for each individual player, though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer.  Because the graphic notation of score (which is a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths) leaves a lot of room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced.  There is no conductor for the performance.  It has been recorded on the album \"Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's & 1990's\".  In a review of a performance by the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1992 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the music critic of \"The New York Times\", Alex Ross, described the piece as \"merely a timid, spastic prelude to Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's monumental \"Po\u00e8me symphonique\" for 100 metronomes\".
